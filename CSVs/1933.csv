29358,2016-11-06T09:18:44Z,3,[98.0],[85.0],Radically change from my previous forecast. When you are wrong it is best to admit it and change course. I was wrong. Tesla recently announced that their cost for batteries is around $190 per kWh. This is well under $300. Prices were $350 last year. This all points to an industry-wide average cost that will be well below $300.

But those contract usually can not be extended if the volume rises. Therefore they may hit the target of under 300 $ / kWh but it wont be sustainable. I have to admit that I've not read the Nature article so I don't know if the price is the average over a longer time period. If not, my judgement is overly pessimistic. If I can get this figured out I'll reevaluate my guess. My interpretation of one of the graphs in the paper is that the prices bottom at the level of Tesla (around 300 $). This view is expressed in the cited Nature article. Taking into account the raw material price increase I still doubt the continued steep decline in costs. Over all 5 % is really to pessimistic up to 10 %."
