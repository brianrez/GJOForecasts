According to a recent press release, the World Series and other championship games will all be held in Arlington Texas to minimize exposure (Press Herald, 2020). Current procedures by the MLB give indications of the response and mitigations against COVID-19. Another factor to take into place is the overall response from sporting events in the United States. Both football and basketball have continued games with mitigations that monitor exposure. I think baseball will follow the same trend, especially since games are currently being played. While games are ongoing, updated brackets are being developed for the World Series. My predictions are as follows:"

While the initial restart of the season was marred by the reality of Covid-19, the league has positively addressed the contaminations and breaches which will allow for the continuation of the season and the championship. The timeline on which the season has operated has been complicated. On July 26, the opening series, Miami was forced to remain in Philadelphia due to Covid-19. The latest case, as of Aug 30, saw the Athletics with one member of their organization testing positive for the coronavirus, forcing the postponement of their game against the Astros. As of the before mentioned date a total of 37 different MLB games, impacting a total of 13 teams, had been postponed due to COVID-19 cases. While the number of postponements has been numerous, the majority of play has been unaffected. 472 games have been played successfully this season by the end of August, meaning that 92.73% of games this season have been played to a satisfactory conclusion. Johns Hopkins university depicted the number of new cases at just over 70,000 for the beginning of the season and 50,000 today (October 3rd). Based on current prediction and models, new cases will decline slightly as the year draws to a close. The series begins on the 11th and past trends show that should an individual test positive for the virus the game can be rescheduled with a week following extensive testing. Thus while a major uptick in cases could cause issues with a timely start to the series, there is a high probability that the World Series will happen.

So far, the MLB has kept fans out in order to social distance and just allow the players to be there and so that they are only exposed to each other. One primary reason I think the world series will happen is that the American people and the players are sick of the COVID restrictions and want to play/watch sports again. Also the MLB has to make money to continue to have future seasons. One of the effects of COVID on MLB is that 43 games have been postponed due to the virus, according to CBS Sports. Another reason I believe the world series will happen in 2020 is the baseball experts have released their predictions and probabilities on which team will win. They would not release this without confidence that the world series will take place.

There is also too much revenue involved in both the money made directly for the MLB and money involved in betting.

The second week of the MLB season was the worst week in terms of the virus, there was a recorded 18 positive cases on one single team. There was also outbreaks on multiple teams that week, and a few cases where the virus caused players to be out for the remainder of the season. One thing is clear: The MLB is not intimidated by the virus and they will do everything possible to ensure that season finishes all the way through for the players, the fans, and obviously for the money. I will give the MLB credit: they may be wanting to see it all the way to the end for a monetary gain, but they have also made improvements throughout the season to make sure that the season continues. They have also established a playoff format to where multiple playoff series are played at the same location, similar to what the NBA has done with the Playoff Bubble. This makes sure that the players remained safe and quarantined during their off time, and are protected from any external things that could cause the virus to spread on a team. I have 10% doubt simply because you can never be too sure with this virus, and there is always the chance that an outbreak could occur."
95559,2020-10-05T22:18:43Z,1,[100.0],[100.0],"My group again utilized the Delphi method for this prediction. We initially all agreed that there will be a 2020 World Series champion due to the 2020 season still in play and the short remainder of the season that the teams have to play. The 2020 MLB season opening was delayed to July 23rd due to COVID-19 and it only has to keep going until the end of October when the World Series typically ends. Only two of the thirty teams have endured a team-wide outbreak of COVID since the start of the season. With the postseason starting on Oct. 5th, there will only be 16 teams in play which lowers risk of COVID exposure."
96033,2020-10-04T23:47:09Z,1,[90.0],[90.0],"Major League Baseball has already posted a schedule for the playoffs (ESPN, 2020). It’s important for baseball to crown a new champion since the Houston Astros were caught cheating in the 2017 and 2018 seasons, which included a World Series victory in 2017 (Bernstein, 2020). This news has overshadowed the game to some extent, with angry fans even going so far as to hire a plane to fly a sign over their game against the Dodgers which read, “Houston Cheats Bang Bang.” (Wells, 2020) Major League Baseball as an organization is probably looking to put this news in the rearview mirror and may be more motivated than most sports leagues to play and crown a new champion. As of this writing, the MLB has designated “bubble cities,” similar to how the NHL conducted their playoffs, in which most of the games will be played. Outside of a major COVID outbreak, which the MLB is actively trying to prevent, the MLB will crown a new champion this season. Confidence level: 90%."
95274,2020-10-04T18:28:10Z,1,[70.0],[70.0],"The chances of not having a world series to decide the MLB championship are going down because we are getting better at controlling COVID-19 at least when it comes to small numbers. It is possible that not every member of the team will be able to play in a championship but there is too much money on the line to not play for both the owners and the players. A change in public policy by the government might take the decision out of the hands of the coaches, players, and owners all together."
95290,2020-10-04T17:09:43Z,1,[85.0],[85.0],I believe that there will be an MLB Championship in 2020. The MLB League has already created and enforced rules to stop the spread of COVID-19 and ensure the safety of all players. At the end of the day it is all about the money. If there were no MLB games or a championship then the League would lose too much money as they already will be close to losing $640K without fans in the stadium.

The playoffs will be different and there remain unknowns about testing for COVID-19 and how that might affect the playing venues and teams. Whether a World Series champion would be considered legitimate by the fans is a different, subjective issue. The abbreviated season finished on September 27th. The World Series appears inevitable. Unforeseen clusters of COVID positivity could potentially impact the playoffs/series. However, the Series appears inevitable. Under the MLB’s COVID-19 Health Monitoring & Testing Plan, during the week ending Thursday, September 10th, there were 11,669 random tests performed with only one positive result (0.0009%). There have been no new player infections. There have been no new positive cases in players in the 12 days preceding the report.

There has been a 33 positive cases incident in the past that made the league look like they were unlikely to play. The MLB Players Association has agreed to the stricter protocols and punishments. A general consensus of boredom amongst the US public as well as loss of money from lack of views makes it likely that MLB Management is trying to push for the games to resume to capitalize on the increased demand for sports and lack of money."

Much of the concern seems to be coming from the fear of a COVID outbreak occurring that would disrupt the playoffs and force postponement, pushing them into 2021. With the odds of that considered, however, the season is currently in play with safety measures in place. Apparently, 43 games have had to be postponed due to COVID outbreaks already, so there is a slight chance of 2021 meeting the 2020 Champions. With the decision supposed to end in October, there is plenty of wiggle room in case of more postponing until New Year's, essentially 60 more days to get more games in just in case. https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-playoffs-bracket-dates-neutral-site-bubbles-everything-else-to-know-about-2020-baseball-postseason/"

This is with the Wild Card postseason games starting September 29. It is very doubtful that the World Series will not be conducted in 2020 considering the very strict COVID restrictions put on players plus their desperation to play as many games as possible in this odd short season. There have only been 43 games ""postponed"" throughout the whole season (July 23- Present). There are also no signs from the commissioner that COVID will slow down the MLB as he stated ""No reason to quit"". There is also an incentive to keep the World Series going because it is a huge moneymaker for the MLB as the 2019 postseason made around $88 million bonus to split across the 10 teams in the playoffs. This is a huge boost to the MLB and each team, which will be used to compensate for not having people in their stands all season. The problem that has become more prevalent towards the end of the summer of 2020 has been BLM protest. Just a month ago the NBA playoffs were shortly postponed in a player protest reaction to the death of Jacob Blake. Although this postponement did not last long, more major emotional events like this may lead to massive protests in both players and in civilians in the major cities where the MLB parks are located. Although tensions are very high and will continue to rise as the election becomes closer, it is very doubtful that the World Series will not be conducted in 2020."

Also, nearly every MLB team has had a positive case of COVID-19, limiting the further possibility of the team being quarantined and having their games postponed. Lastly, the MLB makes hundreds of millions of dollars off of the world cup alone.

A total number of 53, 826 samples have been collected and tested, and only 1% of those samples have returned positive. 49 of the 71 positives have been MLB players, and only 22 have been staff. Because of the COVID regulations in place and baseball naturally being “socially distant” sport, it would be relatively easy for a season to continue and ultimately crown an MLB champion. The season started July 23rd and each team will have had to play a total of 60 games (shortening the season), which is scheduled to end on September 27th. Due to the fact that the season is almost over, it is easy to conclude that the MLB world series will choose an MLB champion for the 2020 season."

In regards to the looming threat of the coronavirus, the MLB is continuing to conduct tests and the most recent results are promising. As of September 25th, only 2 of the 13,279 samples tested were new positives. This round of testing compared to a previous round conducted in early August, where 13 of the 13,043 samples were positive, shows that as of now the MLB’s current COVID-19 precautions are keeping the game in session."

The league will hold the final three rounds...the Division Series, League Championship Series and World Series."" In addition, the MLB has tested all of their MLB players and only 2 of the 13,279 players have COVID. https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-playoffs-schedule-neutral-site-bubbles-everything-else-to-know-about-2020-baseball-postseason/ https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-covid-19-test-results-9-25-20"
95514,2020-09-27T23:41:25Z,1,[99.0],[99.0],"Due to the huge financial loss that the MLB faced do to the corona virus pandemic it will be vital for them to run a post season and play for a championship. If they lose a season completely the MLB commissioner Rob Manfred stated that Major League Baseball stands to lose $4 billion. The MLB cannot afford to lose all of this revenue so some type of season even if modified is essential. There is also a plan in effect for the postseason. There will be 16 teams total going into postseason, including four rounds of games. There will be a best-of-three wild card series, best-of-five division series, best-of seven league championship series, and a best-of-seven world series all according to mlb.com. There has been way too much revenue lost and a lot of postseason planning and preparation for a World Series to not be played to determine an MLB Champion."
95560,2020-09-27T23:27:12Z,1,[95.0],[95.0],"I believe the MLB will decide a MLB Champion by way of a World Series in 2020. The MLB already announced that the season would be abbreviated, and any games that have been cancelled thus far have been rescheduled. As CNN reported, I'm sure the players all eager to play as many games as possible as ""if a partial season is played, players would receive a prorated salary."" The MLB has announced their displeasure several times about playing games without fans in the stands, but as we have seen, the MLB is capable of adapting. It also seems unlikely that the league would be eager to lose even more money since they have already lost so much on this season. https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/22/us/mlb-2020-season-spt-trnd/index.html"
95547,2020-09-27T23:20:16Z,1,[90.0],[90.0],"In the 2018 season, MLB and the 30 teams generated around 9.9 billion US Dollars, with COVID restrictions in place this year each game is losing a significant amount of revenue, estimated to be around 640k per game. Completely canceling the season will further losses in revenue. Despite the reduced number of games and the recent COVID outbreaks, the MLB in its entirety cannot afford to lose more money then it already has by canceling the remainder of the season."
95316,2020-09-27T22:37:53Z,1,[93.0],[93.0],"I believe it is extremely likely that a World Series will decide an MLB champion for 2020. With league championships less than two weeks out it is almost certain that the MLB will take full advantage of the World Series this year. the MLB typically makes 10 billion each year, the MLB might not even make half of that number. With the regular season all over, there is no reason for the MLB to stop scheduling games unless COVID becomes worse. The World Series generated roughly $305 for the MLB last year alone. With revenue at an all time low for the organization, and realistically no reason to put off the series my level of certainty is at 93%. (almost certain according to Sherman Kents chart regarding probabilitative language)."
95304,2020-09-27T21:32:22Z,1,[95.0],[95.0],"I believe there is a very good chance that the MLB plays a World Series. According to the MLB's website a report claims that of the 13,279 tested this week only 2 were new positives. Weather the World series is played is based on how well the teams handle COVID-19 and judging on this report it seems that they are doing very well. Also, the president of the MLB said that they are pushing to have fans at the World Series which means that they are planning on having them regardless of fans or not.

95515,2020-09-27T21:26:52Z,1,[89.0],[89.0],"Sports in the United States historically make money at ridiculous amounts. The fact is, the MLB in 2019 make a record 10.7 billion dollars in revenue. Big televised sporting events make money due to advertisements on commercial breaks. With the continued ban on attendance in sporting events, this period in history could lead to the most money spent by companies on advertisements. Therefore, it is highly probable the MLB will hold its World Series in 2020. https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/22/report-mlb-revenue-for-2019-season-a-record-10point7-billion.html"
95298,2020-09-27T20:37:16Z,1,[94.0],[94.0],"According to MLB there have been 104 positive cases that have been publicly released. However of those 104 positive cases 58 of them have since recovered and returned to play. There are currently 1,026 players in the MLB, so statically only 5% of the players are unable to play at the current moment. Another factor is that the number of cases nation wide are dropping drastically as well, so opinion the MLB will be more willing to continue the season and have a World Series. Not only that but the MLB's revenue is 10.3 billion dollars during a regular season, so if conditions are beginning to get better they wouldn't want to risk losing that much money. The MLB is also using neutral sites to host the post-season games which will help control and minimize the spread of the virus which increases the probability of the World Series championship happening. In closing, due to the increasing number of safety precautions and decreasing number of cases in his highly likely there will be a World Series in 2020."
95530,2020-09-27T20:16:56Z,1,[85.0],[85.0],"Yes I believe that the World Series will decide an MLB Champion in 2020 and here are my reasons why. According to ListWire, “With the Fall Classic so close, oddsmakers have started posting the 2020 World Series champ’s money lines. As a few teams have a strong case for their collective pile-up after the Series-winning out being the sure-thing wager, we looked at what BetMGM thinks about all 30 MLB team’s chances.” According to the latest results from MLB.com, “ Among Major League players, there have been no new positives for 19 consecutive days and in 27 of the last 28 days. The total number of monitoring samples collected and tested has been 127,718. 88 of these 127,718 samples, which is 0.07%, have been new positives.” Also according to the book SUPERFORECASTING, “And some forecasts are meant to comfort-by assuring the audience that their beliefs are correct and the future will unfold as expected.” Based upon the amount of COVID-19 test results that came back positive, the length of time where there have been no new cases, the league’s confidence to be able to start making predictions on who will win the series, and the league reassuring the public that there will be a World Series winner, I say there is a 85% chance of the World Series deciding which team will be the next MLB champion."
95299,2020-09-27T19:53:50Z,1,[90.0],[90.0],"Based on the reports from the MLB back in August, there have only been 141 out of 57,578 tests turn out positive. Statistically, that is only a 0.2% of a positive turn out rate since the beginning of testing in June. Even though this statistic is somewhat outdated due to its last report being in August, there have been no major reports of outbreak sense then. With no recent reports from the constant testing, it is safe to assume there have been no significant increases to the number of cases. Finally, the MLB has also stated that the regular season will conclude September 27th, and that the World Series will begin shortly after on October 20th. They have also stated that the finals will take place at the Globe Life Field in Arlington. With the constant testing and the vast amounts of preemptive measures taken to stop the spread of the coronavirus, is it almost certain that there will be a World Series."
95557,2020-09-27T19:06:14Z,1,[90.0],[90.0],"There is a 90% chance that the World series will decide an MLB champion in 2020. The dates for the world series have already been put into place. More than 40 games were postponed due to Covid-19 complications, but they were all rescheduled so that the MLB championship could still be played."

95319,2020-09-27T17:24:58Z,1,[90.0],[90.0],"Considering the revenue generated by the MLB season in conjunction with the amount of positive coronavirus cases, I predict a 90% chance of the World Series determining the 2020 MLB Champion based on the financial earnings of the postseason and small COVID-19 positive rate. According to 2019 statistics, the MLB netted 10.7 billion dollars in revenue, an increase from 2018, and was slated to increase again in 2020. Despite coronavirus precautions prohibiting fans from many stadiums, the MLB is still predicted to earn similarly to the 2019 season. Estimates for MLB postseason revenue are placed around 787 million dollars, making it financially beneficial to play the World Series. In terms of MLB coronavirus statistics, September 18th tests yielded zero positives among players and staff members out of 12,381 total samples collected. The World Series is slated to play in a single venue at a maximum of 25% capacity, reducing exposure by travel and spectators."
