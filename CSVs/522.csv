Will the US FDA approve the drug molnupiravir for use to treat COVID-19 before 1 October 2021?,2021-03-12T18:00:42Z,2021-10-01T07:01:42Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']","['Business', 'Technology', 'Health', 'US Policy']",596,654,192,237,,https://www.gjopen.com/questions/1963-will-the-us-fda-approve-the-drug-molnupiravir-for-use-to-treat-covid-19-before-1-october-2021

The process for FDA approval moves incredibly slowly, and although it has been sped up somewhat for COVID-19 treatments, the drug is still conducting Phase III trials, which are expected to continue until early November (https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-says-research-shows-its-covid-19-pill-works-against-variants-2021-09-29/). Obviously, there is no chance the drug will be approved before these Phase III trials conclude and their results can be analyzed, so I would project that the drug will be approved by December at the earliest (https://qz.com/2064787/a-daily-pill-to-treat-covid-could-be-just-months-away/)."

102392,2021-09-29T20:14:26Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"Phase III trials for molnupiravir were announced by Merck to have just begun at the beginning of September. These clinical trials can take several months to complete before a New Drug Application (NDA) is filed with the FDA. The process for qualifying candidates for phase III trials has been quite slow as the criteria are strict. Qualification for the administration of the experimental drug is primarily dependent on vaccination status, time elapsed after receiving full vaccination, and risk factor for patients (with high risk individuals being preferred for trials). Before being approved, the FDA must also review and approve the NDA which can take up to 60 days for the paperwork and filing to be complete. Early testing has proven molnupiravir to be effective at combatting moderate cases of Covid-19, meaning the likelihood of it eventually being approved is relatively high; however the October 1st deadline for FDA approval is simply unattainable."

It is mentioned in this official document that after at least two months the EUA is granted or not - so a verdict has been reached. Well - in times of Covid-19 things are different, In this article by the NYT - https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html - where the timelines of all major vaccinces in the US are being tracked it becomes clear that in cases of EUA for Covid-19 vaccinces the FDA was considerably quicker. It took them 4 - 5 weeks after the completion of a positive Phase 3 for Pfizer / Biontech and Moderna. So what does it mean for molnupiravir? Assuming that it takes them 3 month to run the Phase 3 - just as it took Pfizer and Moderna to do Phase 3 as a base rate and urgency is still high we are at the beginning of August. Lets assume we give them a margin for safety since Covid is not so pressing in the summer we still have 8 weeks left till the deadline of October 1. Status update by Merck and the FDA during late August will be curcial . It hinges on the success of Phase 3 which I assumue to be 90 % and the likelihood of the FDA to follow suit with the quick approval in case of Covid-19 vaccines staying below 2 months. Another 80 % likelihood as well - so I come to 64% ( 0,9 x 08) thus far. New update in case Phase 3 fails or succedes."

But Merck are saying “earliest possible emergency use authorisation is second half 21”. Plus results of phase 3 due sept /Oct which make timeline of 1 Oct for this question very tight. In addition the trails say the product is not really useful on hospitalised patients, and are testing on outpatients.

Merck has been around for a long time and knows how to get pharmaceuticals through the approval process. This is an oral drug; i.e., it's more convenient to give most patients than an IV drug. A Merck spokesperson said that, ""Merck is ""actively looking at ideas for pursuing a post-exposure prophylaxis study. I think molnupiravir will very much be useful in that setting."" (https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/exclusives/91702) The ""will... be"" phrase suggests they expect approval, and the description of the Phase 2a results sound really good. Data on the ultimate endpoints (hospitalizations, deaths) are lacking, but trials are in progress. Any improvement even in time to recovery would probably be sufficient for approval of some sort. Typically around 3,000 participants are needed for a Phase 3 trial, and it should be easy to find 3k participants, with cases in the US still over 50k/day. EUA for monoclonal antibody therapy for Covid was given in November with data from 799 participants, even before Phase 1/2 trials, begun in June, were complete. The Phase 2a trial for molnupiravir enrolled 202 people, and other Phase 2 and 2/3 studies are underway. While the FDA contains some different personnel this year than last and will be subjected to less political pressure, its basic operation remains largely unchanged. So, I will be extremely surprised if, at a minimum, EUA for use to treat Covid-19 (and potentially also for prophylaxis) or permission for compassionate use is not granted by October 1, 2021.

My understanding is the primary completion date is the date when they get the necessary data. The study says it runs to December but I think they can apply for approval based on primary completion.

53391,2021-03-12T20:07:38Z,1,[20.0],[20.0],Doesn't take much to get compassionate use. Just need to be severely ill. More a question of phase 3 trial being run. Not a slam dunk that the results will be positive. Although compassionate hse campaigns can become very vocal despite the llw liklkhod of any positive effect of drug intervention. Still i have to be cynical that the molecuke will complete phase 3 with positive results. So i am going 20% just because maybe they complete phase 3 and there is a narrative that it could help and then we have another remdisvir (not to good but lets just give them something).

October 2021 is a long-enough time frame to gather final data, apply for and receive approval. Treatments and therapeutics may become more important and are increasingly in the focus, as SARS-CoV-2 is apparently here to stay, and variants (obviously more deadly) may make highly effective therapeutics necessary despite mass vaccinations; those will be the best means, together with predicting a severe illness and an early intervention, to prevent people from being admitted to ICUs and from dying."
