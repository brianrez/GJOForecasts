The 2018 medal standings are being updated here. At the 2014 Winter Olympics, Russia, Norway, Canada, and the United States were the top four in the gold medal count; the Netherlands and Germany tied for fifth (Business Insider). In the event of a tie in the gold medal count, we will use the total number of medals to serve as a tiebreaker, followed by the total silver medals and then bronze medals, if needed. Confused?

Currently as I write this forecast, Norway has 13 gold medals and Germany just won their 14th gold medal in the 4 men bobsledding competition and are in the middle of the first period of the gold medal hockey game against the Olympic Athletes from Russia. Although the OAR hockey team has better young and veteran players, as well as a historically superior hockey tradition to that of the Germans, it is not a foregone conclusion. Germany has advanced as a severe underdog in this tournament, recently beating the highly-favored Canadians in the semifinal game. After the hockey game, the only event in the Olympics is the women’s 30-kilometer cross country skiing competition. The Norwegians are highly favored to win the gold, as their 3 competing skiers are in the top 5 in the world in this event; however, this event is historically random as earlier today, the men’s 50-kilometer cross country skiing competition was not won by a top 5 ranked skier. I am assigning a 90% valuation to Germany winning the most gold medals, but a 10% chance remains with the Norwegians. If the Germans lose the hockey final and one of the Norwegian skiers wins the final cross-country race of the Olympics, both countries will have 14 gold medals. If this occurs, the Good Judgment Project “will use the total number of medals to serve as a tiebreaker, followed by the total silver medals and then bronze medals, if needed.” Currently, Germany has 30 medals and Norway has 38 medals. Germany will not be able to catch up with Norway, even though they are guaranteed a silver if they lose the hockey final, but this will only give them a total of 31 medals. At the same time, Norway can win 3 more medals if they sweep the women’s cross-country skiing competition, which would give them a grand total of 41 medals in the Olympics, which is highly unlikely and improbable. In the end, Germany has the best realistic chance to get the most gold medals, as they are in a tight game against the Olympic Athletes from Russia team and there are way too many variables in the cross-country competition, such as weather, crashes, equipment malfunction, and a 47-woman starting field, for Norway to get the 14th gold medal. Ultimately, Germany will get the most gold medals, but a 10% doubt remains as Norway has won the most total medals by any country in a single Olympics, thus they cannot be discounted, especially in their strongest and most popular sport."
