Assuming that these people or groups exists, they could go with another option and attempt to pressure Robert Mueller to just leave out certain important aspects. I think with no change in plan, and just 12 days to him testifying, with just under three months till october the 1st i believe it is a high probability.

In light of the issued subpoenas and Mueller's indicated willingness to comply, I think it is very likely that he will. Possible reasons that he would not testify by October 1 include some misunderstanding by the Committee chairmen (as I have not seen any statement from Mueller indicating that he will testify), some kind of legal intervention by the White House (unlikely as AG Barr has said he doesn't object, but anything is possible), Mueller's illness/injury/death, maybe some future deal negotiated to avoid the testimony.
