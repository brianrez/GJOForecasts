73176,2019-06-10T20:32:16Z,1,[80.0],[80.0],"I believe that it is highly likely that between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020 an armed group in Yemen will engage in a campaign systematically killing 1,000 or more civilians in Yemen. Early Warning Project’s own risk assessment rates the risk in Yemen for mass killings as high, currently 6th in the world because Yemen is currently experiencing mass killings. It is unlikely that these mass killings will halt in upcoming months. Human Rights Watch issued a report in November of 2018 regarding the deteriorating situation in Yemen in which 6,782 civilians had been killed and 10,768 wounded largely as a result of coalition air strikes that indiscriminately target civilians and combatants alike. In addition, the illegitimate Houthi government has “disappeared” many civilian journalists, lawyers, and activists. Perhaps the largest threat is the blocking of humanitarian aid by numerous armed groups which has placed 14 million people at risk of starvation and a cholera epidemic. International Crisis Group has alerted that the situation in Yemen as of May 2019 has deteriorated and is at a higher risk of continued violent conflict. Military escalation between Iran and Saudi Arabia increases the risk for further Saudi-led coalition air strikes against Iran backed Houthi forces on the ground in Yemen. In a 7 June 2019 report on the Complex Emergency in Yemen released by USAID states that as recently as 24 May an air strike conducted hit a fuel station killing 12 civilians. USAID also recorded approximately 364,000 cases of Cholera across Yemen, which if medical humanitarian aid continues to be restricted by armed groups may result in many more deaths than the 640 deaths reported. UNDP released a report 30 April 2019 claiming that if a ceasefire is not implemented by the end of the year the conflict could result in a death toll of 233,000 people approximately 102,000 of which would be conflict related deaths and 131,000 would be from starvation and lack of proper health services resulting from the current difficulties in providing access to humanitarian aid. Mines and IEDs are also increasingly impacting civilians, ACLED reported in January 2019 that there has been at least 267 civilian fatalities related to IEDs and mines planted by Houthis. These mines and IEDs present a larger concern for civilians living outside of metropolitan areas."

Both claim to constitute the official government of Yemen. According to the UN and other sources, only from March 2015 to December 2017, between 8,670–13,600 people were killed in Yemen, including more than 5,200 civilians, as well as estimates of more than 50,000 dead as a result of an ongoing famine due to the war. The stalemate has produced an unrelenting humanitarian crisis, with at least 8.4 million people at risk of starvation and 22.2 million people - 75% of the population - in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Severe acute malnutrition is threatening the lives of almost 400,000 children under the age of five. The UN (2019) considers Yemen to be the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, with 14 million people at risk of starvation and recurrent outbursts of deadly diseases."

While the combat in Yemen has seen terrible losses on both sides of the conflict, both sides lack the ability to effectively carry out an intentional mass killing and the impetus. Looking at systematic killing campaigns in general, genocide tends to occur when one side or another has an outsize control over the battlespace and a relative monopoly on violence within the area. In Yemen, currently, neither side has complete control on the situation and the influence of out-of-state actors act as somewhat of a guard against one side gaining the definite upper hand. Further, while both sides are still vying for support from yet more out of state actors such as the U.S, neither side has a motivation to carry out as widely unpopular a campaign such as planned killings."
