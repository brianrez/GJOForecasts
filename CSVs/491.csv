I expect continued language about how inflation is good and this will offset the many years we had inflation below 2% and how they are adjusting their targets.

The similarities are not obvious, but in a second thought, both crises concerned an external shock that hit a booming economy like a flash and the problem of both is ""contagion"", however, at a much larger scope with respect to unemployment and budget deficits in 2020 -22 and maybe a decade to come, and thus with a much larger upward slope in the FEDs balance sheet deterioration. Large deficit-funded spending programs/bills in the pipeline don't bode well for fiscal soundness, and even tax reform plans, if finally implemented, will likely not compensate fully for additional spending in a decade."

Also, under what circumstances will strong demand for USTs (domestic or foreign) return, so the Fed CAN taper without causing a solvency problem?
