I don't believe that the chance of this occurring is quite 0% or 1% at this point, given historical examples of leaders dying in office over the course of 11 months and revolutions in general. The average rate of chiefs of state dying over the last 20 years in office is about 2.25 per year, which would imply about a 1% chance. With the additive chance of revolution from protests, which Russia has suffered two of over the last 105 years (2% per year). I would estimate a probability of about 3% all other things being equal.

Well in Russia there are no other ex-Presidents, except Dmitry Medvedev (May 7, 2008 — May 7, 2012). Yeltsin is resting in peace, no need for immunity for him. He must have been thinking of himself when he drafted that immunity. However, if the (hypothetical) disease is a reality but can be under control, January 2022 is not far enough. Putin did withdraw from the public eye for a long period a few years back. Therefore, if he really has a debilitating health issue we would start being suspicious soon enough."

If he was setting up a way to resign he needs to minimize the risk of a political opponent finding a way to gain power. The odds of a Putin opponent gaining power seem miniscule but they also seem to be rising. Increased odds of a political opponent gaining power if he leaves is an incentive for him to stay in power."

The second, real question is whether we believe he will be driven from office by a popular revolt or a military coup. I find either outcome highly unlikely given Putin's iron grip on the military and security services. He also seems to enjoy enormous popularity with the Russian public, according to independent pollsters in Russia, who give him a current approval rating of 64%, a level that most Western democratic leaders can only envy.[2] This approval rating takes into account the domestic crackdown following the nationwide protests in support of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The internationally peer-reviewed results on the Russian COVID vaccine, showing a 92% efficacy, also boost Putin's ability to remain in power long after January 2022.[3]"
