The Republicans removed the filibuster on Supreme Court nominees in order to push through Trump's nominations, so that is unlikely to be a factor for this nomination (unless Manchin or Sinema see some benefit in being a roadblock). Also, any Biden nomination wouldn't change the Court's current super majority of conservatives, so in theory wouldn't be worth Mitch McConnel falling on any swords to avoid: in fact, Republicans could cast themselves as conciliatory and reasonable by not putting up roadblocks since the appointment is really only symbolic and wouldn't lead to different court rulings (at least near term)."

Since the probabilities are multiplied together to get the estimate, the order doesn't matter, but, logically, it is important to conceptualize that Breyer's planned retirement would reduce the chances of his unplanned vacancy and his unplanned vacancy would reduce the chances of his planned retirement, so this is accounted for. Furthermore, I apply a scalar to account for the time left until the expiration of the question where the probability of a vacancy gets lower and lower as the deadline approaches. That covers modeling the ""No"" probability. For the next iteration, I'll model the two buckets of the ""Yes"" probability, but for now I'll say that I think the chances are high that a replacement justice would be confirmed if there is an opening and sufficient time.

Additionally, thanks to the justice age information provided by @pei-w-lee [2], the approximate mortality of the justices can be calculate based on data from the social security administration [3]. Although the justices each seem in good health for their ages, given that each one may retire for other unplanned reasons as well, the combined probability seems like a reasonable estimate for unplanned replacement of at least one justice. I created a quick script to crunch the numbers [4] (which I'll improve upon later) and came up with an approximate 16% chance of an unplanned replacement (with almost half of this mass resting on Breyer alone if he chooses not to retire for political reasons)."

Stay tuned to @CNN for news. #SCOTUS"" https://twitter.com/JeffreyToobin/status/1483197268828295170 2. I am not familiar with this blog and have no idea whether it's reliable, but an entry from Jan 18 starts, ""This is purely second-hand, but someone I know very well and trust completely is fairly tight with Stephen Breyer, and tells me that Breyer is very seriously considering announcing his retirement before the end of the current SCOTUS term, possibly even in the next few weeks."" https://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2022/01/breyer-retirement-announcement-imminent So for now, I'll go high on ""yes."""

First, he began the current term and has said he’s not yet decided. That suggests he isn’t ready to say he will depart when the session ends in June. Second, if his retirement is intended to promote the democrats’ chances of confirming a like-minded nominee, there is no guarantee that will happen. The Senate’s holds a majority only due to the vote of the VP, and as we have seen both Senators Manchin and Sinema have derailed key administration priorities. Justice Breyer’s replacement therefore would either be dictated by either one of these (or another senator), and the Justice (or the administration) might be worried about the idea of each of fifty senators holding the key to this seat. Likewise, if a D senator dies or becomes incapacitated after Breyer retires, the Rs would hold the majority. I didn’t look it up, but my guess is there are many senators that are older or less healthy than he is. Point 3: Since 1987, 3 Justices died on the bench while 4 retired, which tracks a general near 50/50 trend so it is not like there is any historical tradition that suggests he should leave."
