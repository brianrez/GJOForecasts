I didn't see this until I plotted out the 1, 2, 3, 4, ... n month log differences in yields. There is an abrupt change in volatility starting in the 1950s that has increased over time, especially in the last 15 years to the present. When I first analyzed the data, I included data from 1900 on, which had a modest and relatively constant volatility regime. That skewed my results and probability estimates much lower. Lesson - ALWAYS check the plots for changes in character, etc that may not be observed in aggregate distributions. In addition, @JamesEE makes a very good point that this question is positive if the yield just touches the threshold one time. Given this, I'm updating my probability today quite a bit."

So in order for yields to return/exceed that level we'd like the US economy to return to pre-COVID levels, substantial re-rating of inflation expectations, or a material change in the supply/demand dynamic of the bond market. 2) So let's consider how the Fed is looking at the economy / their monetary policy -- Jay Powells ""hawkish pivot"" certainly increased the likelihood of higher rates/accelerated tapering to combat inflation (https://www.ft.com/content/bbbd46e1-75b3-4882-a2c8-bde7a8df7620). 3) So with a quicker taper (less demand for bonds from the Fed, means bond prices down, yields up). 4) On the jobs front the picture seems mixed (https://www.reuters.com/business/us-job-openings-jump-11-million-october-2021-12-08/) but generally seems like we are trending in the right direction and could approach pre-pandemic levels by the summer 5) Given the above picture, I think there is a likelihood that the US10Y could approach pre-pandemic levels by July 1, but pre-pandemic it appears the yields were <2% -- seemed to trade around 1.90% pretty well. 6) There is also a debt angle at play here -- be it a global ""taper tantrum"" issue or the levels of domestic debt in the US which has risen substantially (total debt >350%) which may limit the level rates can rise given this debt trap and negative consequences of forced develeraging."

(In other words if inflation were accounted for). This can be ascertained from the long term expectations of growth or the TIPS (which is an indicator of the inflation adjusted return) As of now, the 10 year US TIPS is negative, which means longer term growth prospects are poor. https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10YTIP Which means that the market thinks the current prospects for long term growth are dim. 2> Inflation - The US 10 year yield = The TIPS rate + Expected inflation. This equation gives a rough sense of what the market expects the average inflation to be over the next 10 years. Based on the closing prices of 10th Dec 21, this is approx 2.5% {i.e 1.49% - (-1.009%)} 3> Credit risk - If credit risk in the economy rises, demand for US government debt will rise leading to a fall in the yields as US government debt is considered the safest of all borrowings. So to sum up If Inflation rises (ie market thinks average inflation over 10 years is going to be higher than 2.5%). The US 10Y yield will go up. If long term growth prospects improve then the US 10Y yield will go up and vice versa. If credit risk in the economy increases the Yield will go down as people will prefer to hold US government securities instead of corporate loans(The TED spread is a decent measure of credit risk )https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TEDRATE"
