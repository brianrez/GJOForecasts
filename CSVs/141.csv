My reasoning behind this is that right now on the social media app TikTok, the song is becoming very popular with influencers continuously using the song for the past couple of days. However, the reason why it is not so high is that the charts are very inconsistent. The majority of the songs on the charts are popular due to social media apps, however, the song As it Was is on the rise at the moment. The other songs have not had a rise on the charts or do not reach the expectations of listeners, for instance, although Jack Harlow released First Class, the expectation of the album was not there. Additionally, Glass Animals by Heat Waves, although catchy, has been around for roughly two years. The same goes with STAY by The Kid LAROI and Enemy by Imagine Dragons. However, As it Was leads the expecatations and I believe will be the most likely to be the highest."
