Other hand: Scaled Composites do prototype planes,, they seems to have a rate of 1 new plane every 2 years or so. So this makes me a little more bullish.(having said that making prototype planes is their bread and butter). Seems a lot of new tech in this plane, different from normal planes. On other hand, this is a scaled down prototype. I am unaware of any engine testing. - assume there is some stress testing required. Planes are complex, everything has to be right, all they need is one hard issue to hold them up. It's easy to underestimate complexity."

Given timelines extend to the end of the decade, a couple of months either way at this stage seems less important. Why rush and risk a failure? I am curious if there is an incentive to test a prototype that is not supersonic capable in order to meet the deadline (for financial reasons perhaps). For example, specific components needing further development before the prototype could physically reach supersonic speeds (e.g. an engine not powerful enough as it stands)."

We, the public, can't even predict when they'll be doing cabin and ground tests. Why wouldn't they test it this year? They have to get back to work; this is their job. They can't just wait 7 months and then decide to take off January. Then again, low sample size and huge blindspot on this topic. It does not make sense that they would start training for testing and then start 7 months later, though it is possible that they take 3 months to train, 3 months to test most things prior to flight test, and then get into the sky in early 2022."

Given the current climate, it probably will not take much to delay this by a couple of months into early 2022. That said, this is not quite bleeding edge technology - much of the tech is established, albeit not integrated to produce a supersonic aircraft. Interesting, the question specifically states success is only take-off and landing - no supersonic flight. That makes success slightly easier to achieve, if only to allow Boom to claim they met their target, even if it is a short loop around the airfield using components that would not support supersonic flight."

The 5% chance is that they find an engineering flaw with the design that is completely unfixable with the current design (seems quite unlikely).
