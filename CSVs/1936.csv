That's peculiar and makes me wonder: Was he intentionally trying to split the progressive vote? Did they rush the vote to limit his ability to organize and campaign?

That he appeared on both the Principlists’ and Rafsanjani’s ticket for the February elections serves as an indicator of his stature. Amini has moderate views and is close to Rafsanjani. Indeed, after the 2013 presidential elections, Rafsanjani offered him the leadership of the Expediency Council’s Center for Strategic Research, which Hassan Rouhani headed until assuming the presidency that year. Darush Ghanbari, a political analyst and former member of parliament, told Al-Monitor, “Ayatollah Rafsanjani deserves to be the chairman, because he obtained the most votes in the elections. Nonetheless, if Ayatollah Rafsanjani backs Ayatollah Amini, which is possible, his chances will be great. Plus, Ayatollah Amini is well respected among all of the clerics in the assembly.” http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/03/iran-assembly-of-experts-internal-election-chairmanship.html"
