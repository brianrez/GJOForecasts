Surviving births estimate: Rhino population at April 2015 = 645 No. female rhinos estimate -> 320 (50% of total) No. female rhinos aged at least 6 years (typical minimum breeding age in wild) estimate = -> 272 (85% of total) Each breeding-age female rhino tends to produce 1 calf every 3-5 years -> between 272 and 450 births between April 2015 and April 2020: however... Infant mortality rate for rhinos in wild = 12% -> no. survivors -> between 240 and 396 Assume some % of breeding population does not reproduce, for whatever reason -> reduce no. survivors to somewhere between 190-320 (if 20% non-reproducing) and 215-350 (if 10% non-reproducing) [https://news.mongabay.com/2019/10/at-indias-assam-zoo-decades-of-experience-lead-to-rhino-breeding-success/] https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/i/indian-rhinoceros/ . Deaths estimate: Most recent year: minimum of 45 deaths Previous year: minimum of 30 deaths (assume this holds for the previous years since 2015) -> 165 minimum over 5 years Scale up for deaths not detected/reported -> 180 deaths (10% error margin), 200 deaths (20% error margin) https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/one-rhino-dies-every-eight-days-in-chitwan-national-park/ Overall change: suggests numbers should have held up. Best possible scenario would be an increase of around 170. Worst possible would be a modest decrease. These are very tentative numbers. (Perhaps the overall surviving births number has been brought down by lower reproduction rates or higher calf mortality rates than the historic averages, arising from e.g. pressure on resources, adverse weather conditions etc. However it's hard to see the outcome being much better than the best case scenario as birth rates are subject to biological constraints...) Next question: if anything less than the best case scenario is the result of the census, would the government allow its publication given they have announced a doubling in population over the last decade? I find this even harder to predict than rhino population rates. Given the scale of the exercise it seems like it would be difficult but not impossible to find a pretext to suppress publication. However, it might be easier simply to publish and to point to a factor like the 2017 floods to explain a disappointing outcome."
