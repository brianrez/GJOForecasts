Cooper has made a series of tough decisions due to the coronavirus, and so far, North Carolinians seem to be giving him credit for his efforts. Recent polls show Cooper ahead by between five and 19 points, a margin well ahead of Democratic presidential nominee Biden in the state. Forest has tried to raise his profile by suing Cooper over his handling of the virus; the lieutenant governor has also questioned the effectiveness of masks and said he will not mandate them if he wins. Cooper has responded with TV ads chastising Forest for holding crowded, in-person events. For now, Cooper’s approach seems to be serving him well. Indeed, in multiple polls, a durable 8% to 12% of voters indicate support for both Trump and Cooper. Because North Carolina is a purple state, we’re not ready to move this race to Likely Democratic, but it’s clearly leaning in Cooper’s direction."" https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/2020-10-13/analysis-republicans-look-poised-to-maintain-edge-in-governors-mansions"

Roy Cooper remains the favorite for reelection with a hefty fundraising advantage — and steady polling lead — over Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Forest. Forest has come under fire for remarks he's made disparaging the efficacy of mask-wearing that Democrats have exploited. The closeness of the Tar Heel State as the ultimate swing state this election means this one may never be comfortably put away for Cooper. Still, he is running the best of any statewide Democrat on the ballot, and it remains in the Lean Democratic column."" https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/governors/governors-overview/governors-updates-rating-changes-missouri-and-vermont"

His team has also done an excellent job of avoiding resorting to partisan tactics or threats when groups presented challenges in court to his pandemic restrictions (Bars, churches, gyms, etc). He is also a moderate and has a calm and pleasant demeanor. All of this, IMO, will continue to ensure his place as Governor."
