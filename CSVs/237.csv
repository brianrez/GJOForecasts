Putin needs some concession from lining up troops in Ukraine, and creating a Abkhazia/South Ossetia situation in DPR/LPR fits the bill. In addition, it acts as an unofficial block towards NATO because it freezes a territorial dispute which Western Europeans do not want to be involved in. Finally, recognizing and placing troops in DPR/LPR is not strong enough action for the west to impose a strong retaliation. This is a low cost victory for Putin because of de-facto control and limited scope, exactly the types of actions he is incentivized to do -- and has done in the past."
