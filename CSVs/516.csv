Early voting has not been great, there's a lot of confusion and mistrust about vote ranking (will my favorite get hurt in the process if I rank others, how does it work, why does it matter, I dont know any of these people let me just mark first 5 names). People seem to be more uninformed than ever and are pretty much responding to the candidate with greater visibility (who can afford to bombard voters most with mailers and ads, texts and calls).

I guess where I can be blindsided most is that ranked choice voting depends a lot on the person who is liked most across a majority of voters, not necessarily who has the most passionate first-past-the-post support. But because there are ranked choice polls on Wikipedia indicating Adams has a firm hold on the lead, my guess is this concern will not be an issue. Another dark horse candidate seems to be Garcia. Will have to watch closely. I feel uncomfortable putting Yang, who had the lead for months, with the lowest chance of the top 3 picks—against Bayes' theorem logic."

Stringer may be a stronger candidate than I'd originally thought, has the financial backing, but still has the cards stacked against him. The timing and nature of this vote favours older voters so I'm standing by Yang being viewed too enthusiastically in early polling.

Money counts. The ranked choice system may help Yang because voters know him from his presidential campaign and will list him second or third if he’s not their first choice. He's the most known but that will become less relevant as time progresses. Ranked choice votes can unexpectedly favour a 3rd choice if the top 2 are split. Yangs celebrity is unlikely to make him top but could favour in the split. Stringer and Wiley are likely to fall as the race progresses but if the top is split 3 ways it could lean to Stringer. Stringer likely respectable 3 or 4. Adams has recognition and support so is likely top 2. Whether he can pull in front is debatable and a win depends on being the 2nd choice of others farther down ballot. One voting-reform group, FairVote, found that before ranked-choice voting was implemented in parts of the Bay Area in California, plurality-white districts elected a nonwhite representative 35 percent of the time. Under ranked-choice voting, though, those same districts elected a nonwhite representative 60 percent of the time. 62 percent of New York City citizens of voting age are nonwhite. Again, this favours Adams."
