[1][2] While there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding this question, the UAE is clearly spending a lot of time and energy on these programs. Some commenters have floated COVID-19 as a reason against thinking the index will be higher, and this may have some validity as Dubai's change in subjective well-being decreased by 0.263 points in 2020. [3, page 56] However, the report also predicts that Dubai will be 21st in well-being, up from their current spot in 39th. [3, appendix] I personally think that the efforts of the government will show up in next year's index, but there are too many unknowns to assign a high probability."
