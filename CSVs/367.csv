Troubling for the goal is that only 28% of visitors are foreign. Other factors that may jolt numbers, but still low probability: The population of UAE is 10 million - opportunity to increase visits without significant travel. May require incentives from central government. Season pass holders - 1.2 million of the total visits so far. if these are local pass holders, it may amplify domestic attendance impact.

Back of envelope based on average daily attendance in 2021 shows 58m YTD, but that probably has to do with capacity limits. So in 2021 over 9 months Disney saw 58m, possible that over 6 months Expo could see 25m visits since it's a unique event?"

The number of visits will necessarily be greater than or equal to number of visitors. With such a massive event, it seems that people will cross through a turnstile on more than on occasion. If 25 million is the stated goal/projection for visitors, even pre-COVID, then visits makes it a bit more likely to get there 2) In researching another question in this challenge it seems Emirates is running a promotion for 20% off flights between end of September 2021 and March 2022 to coincide with the Expo.
