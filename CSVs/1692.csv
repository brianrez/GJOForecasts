Using the monthly averages in the article (22,705/mo for Oct-Dec and 16,895/mo for Feb-Jun), using the 22,705 number for Jan to fill the gap for a higher end result, and carrying forward the 16,895 number for the remainder of the FY (3 mos), the number shakes out to about 226K (22,705*4 mos plus 16,895*8 mos). It's possible for increases in the last few months, but as the article noted, EOIR case backlog is now above 600K.

Additionally, resources for FY17 remain static due to the CR, preventing ICE from increasing its workforce as directed by EO. Finally, during the height of deportations during the Obama administration, ICE removed just over 400K. The last two years have seen numbers below 250K, but with the renewed push for deportation, FY17 will likely be higher."
