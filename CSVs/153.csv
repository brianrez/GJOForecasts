But when he says this, it seems that he's focusing on the success of WeChat (number of users plus the $16B in revenue it brings each year). I don't think Musk has a plan yet and that he's buying, if he signs tomorrow, because he is being forced to. He's laughing his way through the whole thing."

I know Musk is a ""loose cannon"" but on reflection I don't think he has actually done a full 180 turn, I think he just doesn't want to pay almost double current market price for the stock.

This looks unlikely now with Musk coming to his senses (that he is overpaying for twitter) and trying to establish Material adverse change by insisting twitter was not forthcoming about the number of users on its platform. (the general opinion is that this is farfetched and will be hard to establish) . But this probably ensures that the merger timeline will be stretched. The consequences of backing out of the merger are high too (potential lawsuits + 1$ bn payout).

Not sure if that’s something the new owners will want to pay on top. Using that along with the short time frame to close this as a result in Parag staying a bit longer.

Taking a median estimate of 4.5 months, that would put us in mid September with 1.5 months left before the deadline.
