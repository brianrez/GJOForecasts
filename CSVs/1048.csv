Therefore, as of today, 12/5/19, there is still enough time to draft articles, move them through the judiciary committee and hold a house vote before Jan 1, 2020. The democrats also have the numbers in the judiciary committee and house (233 seats and need only 216 votes) to pass these measures (Clinton impeachment votes followed party lines). Lastly, there has been a vocal push to conclude the impeachment proceedings before the end of the year, thus showing strong motivation to conclude the process in this timeline.

Despite the belief that the Senate will exonerate Trump (based on partisan majority), the passage of articles of impeachment by the House will taint and follow Trump through most of 2020 -- right up to November 8, 2020. This impeachment (which may include various corruptions charges, and further convictions of Trump associates) can be dismissed by loyal supporters/partisans, but it will give opposition candidates sufficient political 'ammunition' and will convince enough voters (Libertarians, Independents, 'fence sitters' disaffected Republicans, etc.) to abstain or vote for another candidate -- whether that is a GOP 'spoiler' or Democrat; both of which favor the opposition party.

By 12/31/19 at 40%. It is my belief that the demographic of GJO has a more diverse demographic and the Republicans forecasting just don't think its going to happen as they are told it is a witch hunt and have not read the transcripts, or the ambassador's notes which aren't just a smoking gun but a smoking arsenal. So without the facts, the Republican forecasters here are under estimating how damaging this is for the trump administration. While on PI, people are wagering real money and giving it long and hard thought about the odds. Ironically, on the flipside, Moody's Analytics has a model as well as the 13 Keys to the Whitehouse model both predict Trump re-election and not by a small margin. However, Moody's model doesn't ingest any scandal component, and the 13 Keys model, can only have scandal affect 1/13th of the outcome at best. So both models have grave limitations in outlier cases such as this. I wonder how they would have forecasted Nixon after the scandal broke?"

For one thing, a December impeachment may offer Republicans a perfect and early opportunity to deflect attention away from President Trump and focus it solely on what they will almost surely call ""partisan politics"", putting the Dems on defense, which in politics is a losing position. Another reason Dems may want to wait until after December to impeach is that the longer they wait the stronger the case for impeachment will become, because it is a near certainty that this president will continue to do awful and blatantly unlawful things. So, for right now, I'm predicting impeachment is unlikely before January 1, 2020."
