There is no way around the Greens unless the CDU/CSU distort themselves beyond recognition to be the minor partner in a coaltion with the SPD, so that gets a generous 4%. I think the Greens are going to be the Center of any negotiations and can get quite a lot of their demands, when they play Conserservatives and SPD against each other, especially when Greens and FDP quickly find a common ground. So the big unknowns at moment are: 1. What is the FDP doing? Because FDP and Union will get along pretty quickly and I asume also Union and Greens would (surprisingly quickly to most people) agree on most issues. That was already appearent four years ago, when the FDP all of a sudden withdraw from coaliton talks. I think in the end it will come down either Jamaica (Union-Green-FDP) or Red-Green-Red. Traffic light seems to me not likely the moment (although quite a lot of people would like to see that), especially when Greens and FDP not coming to a common ground at one point. If that results in a government, I'm not expecting that it will last for four years. I expect long and complicated talks between the parties but also within the parties, especially within the CDU (sorting out the post merkel future within the party), the FDP (party has been a Christian Lindner one man show the last four years), the Left (sticking to doctine and fundamentally to opposition or taking a more practical approach and seeking government responsibility)."

Climate, environment and justice are the issues. From a purely substantive point of view, a coalition of SPD-Greens-Left would fit together; at the moment, Germans most want a traffic light coalition of SPD-Greens-FDP. The FDP, however, would prefer a coalition with the CDU and the Greens. Recently, a coalition of SPD and CDU has also become possible again. The parties have now already announced exploratory talks after the elections for various combinations. I think these talks will take longer than before, I estimate up to four weeks. When it comes to coalition talks, for example, between the SPD, the Greens and the FDP, it could take a very long time because the Greens and the FDP sometimes have completely contradictory content. These talks could fail after 4-8 weeks. Then there are new specialization talks and coalition negotiations again - and all the sudden there is Christmas. Current example: Netherlands. There, the formation of a government has been ongoing for six months."

I lowered my estimate of having the CDU in the government but not the Greens, because Armin Laschet announced, that the Conservatives would not join a government as a minor partner. However there might be still a slight chance, that the Conservatives will still join as a minor, because being in the opposition is also not a popular option for many of them. I increase the chance of having no government at the end of 2021. At the moment there seems five (more of less) viable constellations of forming a government, but all of them require three parties, which would make negotiations, with plenty of bitter pills to swallow plus the approvals by all the involved party bases much more complicated and time consuming.

It is very likely that it will be very close between the CDU and SPD and that there will be many coalition variants. Therefore, the probability has become high that there will be more than one coalition negotiation as in 2017. If the CDU becomes the strongest force, it will start the talks, but they may fail if the Greens drop out and continue negotiating with SPD and Left or FDP. So there is a realistic chance that no new federal government will be sworn in this year. In the last federal election on September 24, 2017, the first coalition negotiations failed and after a total of 5 months and 5 days, the new government was sworn in."

So the SPD and their candidate are doing relatively well, which gives them a not unrealistic chance of actually forming a coalition. At the moment it looks like there will be several viable options of forming a government unlike after the last election, when nobody was really happy with the result. For me it comes down to the question: How likely is it, that the Greens will be part of the next government. I think the probability of the Greens joining the government is at least 80%. Why? Because they are hungry for power after 16 years of opposition. The CDU sees itself as the ""naturaly rightful"" ruling party. Additionally the CDU moved under Angela Merkel considerably away from many classic conservative positions. So not unreasonable to assume them both in the next government and actually getting along quite well with each other. This why I see CDU and Greens over 50% in the next government, but also for the Greens having realistically also options cooperating with other parties."

I lowered the probability of having no government formed until end of the year. I do that because Germans don't like uncertainty and adding to that, long negotiations of a new coalition only benefit the AfD, so rather continuing such an unease, someone is going to swallow some bitter pills. My take for the moment is Greens and the Union, if they get enough seats together. The Greens because they are eager to get into power, and in their mindset, they have been way to long in the opposition. The Union on the other hand probably going to have some heated dicussions about joining in or leading the opposition, similar to the SPD four years ago. But to be a junior in government is a rather foreign thought to them, which they first have to get used to. When numbers are so, that a government can't formed without the Union, they are grudgingly joining, cause avoiding uncertainty, but not without some turmoil within the party. I increased the probability that Union will be in the government but not the Greens and decreasing government with the Greens but now Union. I do that, cause there is, in my estimate, the hype the Greens got from nominating their chanceller candidate is going to dampen a bit, while the Union after the more chaotic nomination is closing their ranks."

Mainly because, a government with only one of them, would be quite unstable (if at all possible), because of just a tiny majority in a multiparty coalition covering a relatively wide political spectrum. The question is: Do they have a majority together? If yes, they will quickly get an agreement and form the new government. They had already talks after the last election together with the FDP. This talks actually went, to the surprise of a lot of observers, well between Greens and CDU/CSU, but failed in end because the FDP pulled suddenly out. So Greens and CDU would go along quite well with each other. The other possiblity is they are going to need a third partner and this might be tricky to get an agreement there until end of 2021. This would not be unpresented as I just described. AfD would be not an option for both of them, the Left party almost certainly would be a no go for CDU/CSU, so the only viable options would be FDP and Social Democrats, the first would consider the government option more seriously than four years ago and Social Democrats, I asume, pretty much split about a government role, where they can have an influence but crumble even more or going into the opposition and hoping to sharpen the party profile the next years."

About 25 millions adults or so are retired and are extremely conservative. 13 millions adults or so have an age between 55 and 65. That means half of population are retired or are going on retirement soon. 10 million children going to schools or universities or doing an apprenticeship. About 10 Millionen so are migrants and do not have citizenship of Germany and can not elect. The rest do not going to election. Gerontology part of society will determine the election. The whole society has to pay for retired people about 330 Billion Euro per year. The normal budget of Germany is about 340 billions Euro. The transfer duties of young population to retired people are extreme and will be more extremer in this decade due to demographics. Therefore the Germany society is a transfer society. Retired people, young people, etc.. The Germans hate Change, hate Technology, hate Capitalism, hate Industry, hate China, hate USA, hate EU, hate Foreigners, hate military people, ... The CDU + SPD governments after about 15 years have a legacy: Insufficient administration, insufficient infrastructure, insufficient digitalization, ... Revolution is being needed. The outcome of election might be that a new government are elected that ensures going ahead with same, or the outcome is shocking > Communism > Green + Linke + SPD. They dream: The cow is being fed in the heaven and is creating golden ducats of the flat earth. All people love each other. Therefore military service is nonsense. Intelligence services should be removed. Any form of capitalism must be disestablished. Corona management in the next months may have an effect on voters to held CDU and SPD accountable."

First, the easy part: Yes, it took forever last time for a coalition to form. This year we there is a pandemic; as opposed to the relatively uneventful winter of 2017/18, Germans would not accept coalition negotiations stretching into the next year. Remains the tricky part of predicting who will build a coalition in 2021. A very helpful (German language) page is https://www.bundestagswahl-2021.de/koalitionen/ ; you can see that none of the actual coalitions of the past have a shot at a majority in the Bundestag, even CDU/CSU+SPD might, for the first time in history, not reach half of the seats together. CDU/CSU will be, despite their internal conflict, almost for sure be the strongest party and try to form a coalition. The Greens will be, almost for sure, number two. If CDU/CSU+Greens reach a majority, it is likely they overcome their differences and form a coalition (like in Austria, where this coalition formed even before Corona). If CDU/CSU+Greens don’t reach a majority, they will try again to form a “Jamaica” coalition together with the FDP; as the FDP, after leaving the Jamaica talks in 17/18, subsequently lost heavily in support, they will be inclined to join this time (plus the pressure taking responsibility due the health crisis). All other options are pretty unlikely: The “Kenia” variant with CDU/CSU+Greens+SPD will be pretty oversized (therefore unlikely, see Axelrod’s minimal connected winning coalition theorem: https%3A%2F%2Flirias.kuleuven.be%2Fretrieve%2F280402&usg=AOvVaw0fZrpEqCKRUWhhRk47r9KR ) The “Germany” CDU/CSU+SPD+FDP would be novel, and very surprising outcome, as there are be even more differences to overcome. All in all, - very unlikely no coalition this year - very unlikely neither CDU nor Greens in it - very likely both of them are part of it"
