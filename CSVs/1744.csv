Digital Trends, September 28, 'DRONES CAN HELP WHEN DISASTER STRIKES, BUT ONLY WHEN THEY’RE ALLOWED TO': https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/rescue-drones-hurricane-flood-disaster-relief/ Clips from article: ""Bots vs. bureaucrats Following Hurricane Harvey, a collective of drone experts known as Humanitarian Drones used DroneDeploy to map damaged areas for the National Guard and the city of Houston. The group, formed solely to help with Harvey relief efforts, was initially tasked with helping the American Red Cross with post-Harvey aid — but its efforts were hampered by an unnatural force that often wreaks havoc on innovative ideas: bureaucracy. “Don’t attach yourself to any one organization. We learned that with the Red Cross,” Humanitarian Drones member Ty Audronis told Digital Trends. “I’m sure they’re a fantastic organization, but they’re really big, and with a big organization comes a lot of bureaucracy and a lot of opinions. So, while they were figuring out whether or not they wanted us to help them, we should’ve been out helping other people at the same time instead of waiting on them.”"

""To bring the outbreak under control, it won't be enough simply to treat those people who reach medical facilities. We also need to address the source of the disease, by improving water and sanitation and working in communities to prevent new cases."" The WHO says fewer than 45% of health facilities are fully functioning in Yemen, with almost 300 damaged or destroyed in fighting between forces loyal to President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi - who is backed by a Saudi-led multinational coalition - and those allied to the Houthi rebel movement.

The humanitarian system should therefore focus on uses in natural disasters and early recovery settings. • To tap into the growing interest in UAVs, particularly in technical communities, humanitarian organizations should engage in networks that promote good practices and guidance, and that can serve as a source of surge capacity. • Despite their potential to enhance humanitarian operations, more research and evidence is needed to identify the comparative advantages of using UAVs. More research is needed on in- tegrating aerial observation and data collection into needs and damage assessments, search and rescue, and other humanitarian functions. https://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/Documents/Unmanned%20Aerial%20Vehicles%20in%20Humanitarian%20Response%20OCHA%20July%202014.pdf _________________________________ COMMENTS: The usefulness of the UAV is undeniable; Interest is building in the use of UAVs to assist in search and rescue, particularly when equipped with infrared, or other specialty cameras. For example, the European Union is fund- ing ICARUS, a research project to develop unmanned search and rescue tools to assist human teams. To be useful, the UAVs and trained sta must be available within 24-48 hours of a sudden-onset disaster. In addition these technical approaches must be integrated into the protocols for rescue teams, agreements for importing dis- aster response equipment, the International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG) guidelines and other areas of policy. BUT there are challenges to an effective use of UAV. The biggest challenges to expanding the use of UAVs are legal and regulatory. In the OECD, most countries are just developing legal guidance for the commercial or civilian use of UAVs. Many countries in the global South, particularly those with large humanitarian caseloads, may have very little regulation at all. In the U.S., commercial unmanned aerial system (UAS) licenses were granted on a case-by-case basis, subject to approval by the FAA.27 Similar restrictions exist in the UK and EU.28 Many countries where humanitarians are working do not yet have legal frameworks, meaning that use of UAVs will probably need to be cleared on an ad hoc basis with local and national authorities. To ensure long-term acceptance of these tools it will be critical that humanitarians comply with all host country regulations and develop appropriate agreements with regulators. A particular issue is interference with traditional air tra ic: in many countries it is illegal to fly anything within 5km of a commercial airport. As humanitar- ian operations o en center around emergency airports and logistics hubs, these restrictions are of particular concern. Other than the above there are also issues of: Ethical procurement and partnerships Privacy and data protection Transparency, informed consent and community engagement *** Ironing out all these issues takes time. While, like the consensus I do think it will be the thing of the future, this Q may close before all issues are solved."

In an area affected by a natural disaster, drones may be able to deliver necessary equipment where a truck can’t go."""

Also last year, Flirtey, a drone delivery service, conducted test flights to help determine whether drones can be used to carry human medical samples to and from areas during major natural disasters. The drones flew between an onshore medical relief camp and a test facility on a vessel stationed on the Delaware Bay. ""The use of this disruptive technology in supporting humanitarian and emergency operations is a major paradigm shift and significantly enhances the ability to support field medical operators and first responders in remote or otherwise inaccessible disaster sites,"" William Marshall, assistant vice president for government and military relations for NJIT, said during the Flirtey test. ""The data captured here will be shared with all of the participants, including the FAA, in support of the agency's ongoing research into the integration of UAS into the national air space."""

UAVs would be the most cost-effective choice of delivery for the Sub-Saharan theatre, the rapporteur of the dossier, Heinz Schröder of the ruling party (Christian Democrats), said in a press conference on Monday. IHS and UAFP were said to be in closed-door negotiations with the European Union and Germany to extract a government bail-out, as compensation for its business loss.

The risk of losing the drones and the aid not making it to the intended people are reasons why I don't think we will see a drone used to deliver humanitarian aid to a conflict zone in 2017.

The attack occurred on Tuesday near Yirol, in the centre of the country about 210 km (130 miles) northwest of the capital of Juba, where the aid workers had been dealing with a cholera outbreak. In a statement, the IOM said the convoy was targeted as it returned to Yirol, with the gunmen ambushing one of the vehicles. Two people died of gunshot wounds, the aid group said, and an IOM health officer was among the wounded. The identity and motivation of the attackers were unknown, the statement said. Also on Thursday, medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said its hospital in Wau Shilluk had been looted during recent heavy fighting. ""Wau Shilluk was looted of all medicines including life-saving drugs and essential supplies,"" Abdalla Hussein Abdalla, the deputy head of mission for South Sudan, said in a statement.

The Cipher Brief, February 12, 'The New Technology of Humanitarian Assistance': https://www.thecipherbrief.com/article/tech/new-technology-humanitarian-assistance-1092 Clip from Cipher article: ""Potential advances in artificial intelligence (AI), however, could allow swarms of small drones to slip by air defense systems to individually deliver small packages of cargo—possibly even create impromptu networks for Wi-Fi and establish phone signal availability. Chow asserts that “as costs come down and AI-driven avionics accelerate in power, flotillas of drones over vulnerable regions can provide constant coverage for early detection and rapid response to humanitarian crises.” Artificially intelligent drones could also address major impediments to post-conflict reconstruction, such as landmine removal to enable locals to return to an agricultural economy while mitigating indiscriminate casualties largely affecting children. The Mine Kafon Drone seeks to autonomously map a designated area, detect the positioning of mines via GPS and then safely detonate them at a pace unmatched by even skilled personnel."""
