Emergency room visits are not increasing, so this appears to be a testing phenomenon and not an actual second wave. The PCR tests are well known to be extremely oversensitive giving many false positives. Every time you have a false positive then you have to test everyone in that person's contact list, giving you more possible false positives. The R naught of the test is greater than the R naught of the virus. again, I'm basing this on the fact that emergency room visits are not increasing. it could be simply that the virus is moving through a different segment of the population, a younger segment that does not have symptoms when they are positive... which again is questionable whether that should be treated as a positive case. so this arc is not going to follow the same arc of the original outbreak."

That's about 25% of statewide cases, while the city has about 40% of the statewide population. I had to dig up an envelope so I could do the estimates on the back of one, but it looks like the city won't see 1k new cases until some time in December at the earliest.

Upcoming holiday gatherings and travel pose major risks, however it will take at least a few weeks to see the impact of that, and summer holidays did not lead to large spikes in cases. However, those were much more likely to be celebrated outdoors compared to fall/winter holidays, which needs to be considered. Assuming the virus first arrived in NYC in very late 2019/early 2020, and cases peaked in March/April (with no protective measures like mask wearing in place), I'd assume it would also take us a while us to see case levels reach 1,500/day again even if our efforts to contain the virus in the winter are not very successful. That's why I believe there's a 50% chance we will not hit 1,500 before Feb 2021."
