This effectiveness against the spread of the pandemic further impressed most Chinese citizens as they saw their counterparts in the West get ravaged by the disease. Xi Jinping will crush anyone who is out of line, and there is a ongoing lite-purge of the CCP Police. The heirs of Jiang Zemin and Deng Xiaoping are silent for now biding their time and hiding their true intention. We must remember that back in 2012 that Xi Jinping sidelined Bo Xilai and imprisoned the intelligence chief, the remaining members of the politburo will not forget. So maybe one if Xi wants to make another example but equally likely it is zero this year. However, it must be said that there are unconfirmed rumors of several assassination attempts on Xi's life (likely in my opinion due to constitutional changes made in 2018, which pissed off a lot of people due to changes in term limits i.e. making Xi de facto President for life). If there are two or more expelled, then it will because a attempt got close to succeeding."
