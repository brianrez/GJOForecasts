I think it’s taking a long time to come to this decision based on the sink cost fallacy— Japan’s National conversation about the 2020 Olympics has been omnipresent all the time that I have lived here (5years). Once the decision is announced, Japan will probably begin to do a better job regarding Covid-19. General public opinion here is that the government is downplaying it because they had wanted to preserve the Olympics. That, and Japan’s lack of a CDC (meaning bureaucrats were responsible for assessing the risks of Covid-19, not an informed panel of experts) led to digging of heels in on the Olympics for longer than it should have been. But Japan is very sensitive to their national reputation and the criticism that attempting to keep the 2020 Olympics is irresponsible will probably make it easier for the government to save face about changing their direction."

Huge effort just to play games, and perhaps they can just postpone to maybe September 2021, assuming a vaccine can be developed by then.

If new cases in North America and Europe slow coming into late spring and early summer supporting the theory, the probability the games will be canceled will be very low. Add to that the mortality rates to the young and fit now is also very low. I would, therefore, expect the majority of athletes will have only suffered mild symptoms if any at all if they become infected. The spectators may be a different issue, however, the majority of the money from the games comes from the broadcasters and advertisers, and not ticket sales, so limiting spectators shouldn't hurt too much. The Paralympics come later in the summer so the temperatures should still be good, and while the athletes are typically young and fit as well, there is more potential that some would suffer more from symptoms based on their underlying physical conditions. If that is widespread, a lack of athletes may disrupt the games, however, the withdrawal of up to 10% of the athletes would likely not cause the games to be canceled."

I've downtuned on the cancellation of both events to accommodate the possibility the Olympics will go ahead as planned, but in the face of a pandemic with unknown physical & political consequences, I'm still hedging my bets on some form of interruption to the schedule. Not least because despite closing schools Japan is still accepting flights from nations now fighting their own icebergs of infection. The IOC and Japan will need to make a decision very soon about whether they intend to go ahead with the Olympics or not, almost certainly with Covid19 still accelerating globally and an increasing number of qualifying events being cancelled along the way. It would be terrible for Japan to have to cancel or postpone, but business as usual in the face of mass deaths, sickness and endangerment for athletes may exact an even heavier political & economic cost."

Given the infection's expected trajectory, this has the appearance of political non-disclosure. 2) The seeming decision by the US and Britain to allow Covid19 to become endemic, which would make cancelling the Olympics pointless. 3) The huge economic investment by IOC nations. 4) The cultural adoption of a ""We don't know enough about this virus to justify cancelling anything"" rationale in countries making minimal attempts to contain the virus.

For example, the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona was canceled as result of big international corporate attendees canceling their attendance. 2)Attendees: if the risk of becoming infected are higher, then possibly country olympic committees will cancel their participation for protecting their elite teams. It would be a catastrophe for any country, specially from the PR perspective, if an olympic athlete dies as result of COVID-19, either within or outside their country of origin. Different government countries start to enforce ban of big gathering of people in order to avoid further transmission of the virus. Cultural, musical and sport events have been canceled in many countries already. TV crews are also deciding to decline attendance to big events as result of COVID-19."
