94632,2020-08-21T17:54:29Z,1,[78.0],[78.0],"I've seen multiple people arguing that Colorado is blue and getting bluer, but recent presidential election results do no bear that out. In fact, since the state swung blue in 2008 to vote in President Obama, the margin of victory for Democrats has lowered from 9 points to 4.9 points, a drop of around 45%, so while the state is still blue leaning, it is not a liberal powerhouse dominated by progressive voters. That being said, Colorado has adopted several measures early on (i.e. marijuana legalization) that suggests it is willing to break from the pack and lead the nation on reform efforts if necessary. But, and this is a big but, is this really necessary? Will it get the support of Colorado's citizens enough to push it over the line? First, it's important to ask how much this compact actually does. Every state that is currently in the group is blue (just compare the map of NPVIC states to those that voted for Clinton in 2016), so the upside is incredibly low for blue states to join and very high for red states to remain out. If the popular vote goes blue, odds are all the members would have already gone blue and the GOP still may win the EC, but if it swings red then now the presidential candidate will win by a gigantic margin due to the blue state's agreement to back the popular vote, which could do long term damage to their party image. So, then, this is entirely principle driven (for the moment). Not a bad thing since most people vote with their conscience anyway. But how much will it impact Colorado votes? Well, 2016 aside, Colorado has sided with the popular vote every year since Bill Clinton won in '96 (and he won the EC too), meaning entering this pact would not likely have a tangible impact on the preferences of Coloradans, but it might. More importantly, however, 2016 was the most recent cycle and still fresh in everyone's minds, and the popular vote was ultimately discarded in that election. That being the case, voters are more likely to feel disenfranchised because of the most recent results and vote to join this pact than they would in other years. Finally, from a psycological standpoint, people are more likely to vote for what is already happening than for a change. Because it will be framed on the ballot as a veto and not an adoption of a policy, I think neutral and uninformed voters are more likely to avoid the veto than they might be to support the original adoption of the policy. You can see similar trends with organ donor statistics in various countries. As such, I think it will pass, though less because of party politics and real need for change and more because of basic human psychology."

89039,2020-08-21T02:17:40Z,1,[51.0],[51.0],"There’s a lot of competing evidence to balance when it comes to whether Colorado’s voters will approve membership of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. A base case is a good starting point. 15 states have passed laws committing to a national popular vote plus DC. [1] Regionally, Colorado sits in the West according to the US Census Bureau. [2] This is the second most likely region to approve the compact - 38 percent compared to the Northeast’s 66 percent. I’m choosing to group states by region to account for political culture without overfitting. That regional average seems to be a good place to start. Important to note, is that the NPVIC has not been subjected to a referendum in any state and has always come into fore via the state legislature. That’s where we have to start getting into some specifics."
691,2020-08-20T20:51:19Z,3,[98.0],[0.0],"There is a more moderate and sensible way to vitiate the effects of the electoral college, which is for states to eliminate the winner-take-all rule, as Maine and Nebraska have. If you get the most votes in the state you get two electoral votes, then one for every congressional district you carry. In general, while you can still get funky distortions, the electoral vote will be a somewhat closer reflection of the popular one. Not perfect, of course--gerrymandering weakens the result, for example--but a step in the right direction may be preferred to a leap off the wrong cliff."
