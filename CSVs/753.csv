Since interest rates are unlikely to increase in the coming months, that should drive the stock price up substantially. However, depending on the behavior of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, their sales may take a hit depending on what legislation is passed in the coming months, which may depress the price. It is also unlikely that they will offer dividends, which could also reduce the end-of-day Market Capitalization stats. The uncertainty in the market will also likely take something away from its cap, even though it has thus far performed quite well. That being said, with its large volume of sales and its status as the largest mortgage lender in the country, it likely won't go for less than $35 billion. Historically speaking, however, that benchmark is quite high and likely won't be surpassed by much."
