Will Iran execute and/or sponsor a low or higher level cyber attack against networks owned by a US entity between 19 September 2017 and 30 November 2017?,2017-09-19T17:00:45Z,2017-11-30T07:59:45Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']","['Technology', 'Security and Conflict']",413,654,211,237,"At least part of the attack must occur during the question's open period. The question will be suspended on 30 November 2017 and resolved on 31 January 2018 to allow for delayed reporting. The following levels of cyber attack will all count: Low-Level Cyber Attacks create temporary and/or localized disruption of services that are dependent on networked infrastructure but do not threaten the core functionality of critical infrastructure targets. For example, a series of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against banking websites-while widespread-would cause only temporary disruption of Internet access to customer's bank accounts. They would not affect customer account balances or other banking services such as ATM withdrawals, nor would they disrupt the larger financial system, although the affected banks would incur losses because of the mitigation and other costs.Moderate-Level Cyber Attacks create localized, nonpersistent disruption to core functionality of critical services and functions but do not generate substantive systemic or national-level effects. For example, a cyber-attack that disrupted a single power plant for a couple of hours-equivalent to a temporary local power outage from a snow storm-would qualify as a moderate-level cyber attack. High-Level Cyber Attacks disrupt critical infrastructure services and generate substantive systemic or national-level effects over an extended period of time. For example, a cyber attack that reduced oil pipeline transport across a key region and resulted in a spike in national oil prices over the course of a month would qualify as a high-level cyber attack. Catastrophic Cyber Attacks affect the fundamental viability of core government, military, or economic services or functions; or cause significant loss of life or widespread property damage. For example, a cyber attack against critical infrastructures that caused an economic depression would qualify as a catastrophic cyber attack. A US entity can be governmental, commercial, academic, nonprofit or an individual. For the question to resolve as 'yes', the government of Iran must sponsor or execute the attack. Outcome will be determined by credible open source cybersecurity industry analysis or media reporting (e.g., Crowdstrike, FireEye, ThreatConnect, Symantec, McAfee, Reuters, BBC, AP). Confused?

In addition, cyber attacks attributed to Iran in the past have generally not risen to the level stated in the question above. However, the probability of this event occurring is not zero because 1. the IRGC is not completely under the Rouhani's control and may seek to provoke the Americans in order to score political points against the Pres. Rouhani. 2. The escalating tensions in Lebanon may push Iran to attempt to discourage any further American, Saudi, Egyptian, or Israeli action in Lebanon through a show of cyberforce. 3. It is possible that a rogue state employee of the Iranian state or rogue Iranian state elements break with official policy and proceed with an attack 4. It is possible that the Iranians get blamed for an attack that they do not have a hand in."

Politically, Iran is dependent on the US viz. the nuclear deal - which is at risk, presently - and the post-war configuration of Syria. Things could change if Congress fails to certify the nuclear agreement and unilaterally re-imposes sanctions; but that is unlikely, and certainly unlikely before the end of November. One potential wildcard is that Iran's cyber command is under the control of the IRGC - and it's unclear whether they can act independent of Rouhani or not.

Cyber strategies are often used, as noted by several prominent analysts on Cybersecurity, to engage in political warfare. While more recent attacks against the US appear to be based on economic motivation, some correctly make a strong argument for the underlying strategies that seek to accomplish the following: strategic reputational costs for affected states and their position in the international system; signaling a resolve by originating states, communicating political messages of strategic importance in the broader diplomatic and military interactions among states; a core principle is that of undermining strategic alliances among states; and it is also a direct attack on international norms and the recreation of anarchic conditions in regional and international systems. The observations apply to all 4 IFPs regarding cyber and national security."
