The hardliners in the Republican party will prevent that legislation from covering amnesty for the parents of the children and conversely Democrats will not move to shut down the government twice for illegal immigrants in a mid-term year. Democrats will grant sizable funding for the Border Protection System (some type of wall), in exchange for an extension of the DACA program for the Childhood Arrivals NOT their parents. and the White House will be incentivized by this funding and the dual victory for Trump of getting the Wall, and making a deal."

Nevertheless, i can also tell the personal story of my family members being turned away from entering the U.S. because there was no room at the in because the line was too long already and they did not have the pressing issue or the border the could walk-across, whether it be hard or easy not the question here. the question is was it just for the emigration of the people to come from their home country to the U.S. an was it in the best interest of the U.S. to now send the DACA students back to there country. First, only on a case by case basis can this even be approached if the U.S. were to start to send any DACA students back to the home country. Therefore, cost v. gain of situation = what is gained by sending the DACA students back according to President Trump ""Make America Great again"" my point of view it will not change this and America's standing in the world for sending DACA students back to another country they might never have ever have been is not I the best interest of the U.S. nor the world. solution; the DACA students should have to do community service that is in some form service to the country they left and in some form service to the U.S. it does not have to be military i believe with the world hunger and such there is more to serve than just military."

The question is whether Congressional Republicans would be able to consolidate around a set plan well enough to see it through (see: Obamacare repeal failure) or be able to round up enough votes from the other side of the aisle. The biggest issue is that it would be difficult to cater to both parties given how they would likely need to pair it with some form of toughened border security or restrictions to the eligible participants of the program to appease conservatives (which would likely only drive away Democrats) or provide softened enforcement in the form of a largely unrestricted DACA program which would deter already uneasy conservatives. There certainly seems to be a desire to get something done, but it largely depends on a widespread base of support in Congress, which is never a given. As for the President, he hasn't appeared to give a strong stance either way, so my best guess would sign the bill if it did pass."
