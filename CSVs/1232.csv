The only scenario in which a PM would be chosen sooner is if either Johnson or Hunt drop out. Johnson would have to come under serious heat to consider dropping out due to the fact that he is the overwhelming favorite to win, has been waiting for this moment for over a decade and is notoriously stubborn. Furthermore, he is well known for his eccentric personality and pension to say ridiculous things, thereby and has proven that controversies are hard to stick on him. Hunt is far more likely to drop out of the race due to a controversy or fading chances. However, He has alreadry signalled his willingness to stick it out promising Boris Johnson ""the fight of his life"". Moreover, his term as Health Secretary was fraught with controversy, and he remained in office, showing that Hunt too is someone who works through controversy. Finally, this resignation would have to happen within 9 days, before any conservative member would have a chance to vote.

When the EU warned the UK not to waste the extra time they had (to 31st October) to leave the EU, they did not mean the UK had extra time to negotiate a new Withdrawal Agreement, they meant there was extra time for the UK Government to figure out how to get the WA that had already been agreed thru Parliament. As none of the candidates remaining have even mentioned the possibility of getting the current WA thru Parliament and are basing their tactics on forcing the EU to reopen the WA there is not really any rush to get the new PM in place, as the EU have made it clear that WA negotiations are over and the EU is busy sorting out who the EU Commission is going to be made up of from November. I doubt that Barnier would want to give the UK a Brexit renegotiation when he has no authority and he is busy trying to get a higher job. This confusion (ignorance) is typical of the UK's dealings with the EU, they seem to be incapable of understanding what those on the other side of the table will or can do, or what they want. Its very odd that the candidates for PM all claim to be expert negotiators but appear to have no idea how getting people to agree with you works.

Boris Johnson begins the week as the overwhelming favourite but with his credibility damaged by his refusal to appear in a television debate on Sunday. Today Tory MPs hold closed-door hustings; tomorrow there will be a secret ballot to eliminate the least popular candidates (who need at least 33 votes to survive). The (probably five) remaining then appear in a second TV debate; this time Mr Johnson has deigned to take part. The prime-ministerial hopefuls have all shown an alarming tendency to embrace economic incompetence. Most are prepared to see the country crash out of the European Union without a deal. And they are proposing huge tax giveaways, often directly to their supporters. That is because the party’s 160,000 members—overwhelmingly white, male, affluent, Brexity and old—get the final say on whom to anoint.“"

She will continue as Britain’s prime minister until a new party leader is chosen. The contest kicks off on June 10th. Eleven Tory MPs have already put themselves forward, but the party’s 1922 Committee, which supervises the race, says each must have the support of at least eight other lawmakers to stand. The parliamentary party then holds a series of votes to whittle the number down to two. In late June these two go to a postal ballot of 124,000 party members—who tend to be older and more vehement Brexiteers than the general population. That makes Boris Johnson, who says he is perfectly prepared to leave the European Union without a deal, the front-runner to inherit the prime ministership. Whoever wins will have little time to resolve Brexit, as the latest deadline for it is October 31st.“ The process and timing seem anachronistic."

While this is unlikely, and some have suggested it could take as little as few weeks, a selection of a leader in the face of a Brexit decision may draw out beyond July 1. As the new PM will be instrumental in Brexit negotiations and it's future, and the party having been divided on how Brexit should look, I see the leadership contest dragging out for at least three weeks (just as decisions on Brexit have dragged out). This would effectively leave May as PM on July 1. Still a possibility though, is a rapid decision to secure some stability in the party. 35% has been given to this option to account for such an event, while 65% has been given to the more likely scenario that a new PM has not yet been selection on July 1."

Having in mind that the overnment announced the securitization of the problem related to the environment, however, this makes possible in case of May being removed from power to be elected someone from the Green party under the pressure posed by Extinction Rebellion. I,however, attach a minor possibility for elections to happen before 1st July 2019 and see it as most possible outcome to be for Theresa May to stay in power until 1st July 2019 as elections before 31st October when the UK withdrawal from the EU is scheduled may cause bigger financial instability under new government than under the rule of May who has been handling the whole process so far."

Therefore, even though she is protected till the end of the year, she's recently announced that she'll set an election timetable for a new conservative party leader if her deal fails again in June. Her deal is expected to be brought up again beginning in June, but when the actual vote happens isn't known yet. I believe that her deal will fail once again, because it has failed three other times before, there is now no imminent drop out day looming about MPs and conservatives have now been promised that they can get rid of Theresa May if they reject her deal. This means May would have to get the Labour party on board and negotiations with Jeremy Corbyn and Labour leaders have esstentially stalled with Corbyn claiming that talkks ""have gone as far as they can"". Therefore, it's highly unlikely may will get Labour support. For these reasons I am I find that Theresa May's deal will almost undoubtedly fail, thereby triggering conservative party elections. However, if may's deal passes then she'll continue to be PM at least till July 1st 2019."

The Pm has already suggested she would announce a time table for resigning should the vote on the 3rd fail, meaning she is likely to be leaving. However she may string out announcing resignation until the results of the 15th tory assoc vote of no confidence, and will likely take a couple of days after the 4th meaningful vote before she makes any formal announcement. Assuming the announcement comes towards the end of the week, this leaves only 3 weeks for a successory to be appointed, the party to canvas its members and vote, or for a GE. This process is likely to take much longer than 3 weeks, and so I do not expect to see her leaving before July 1st. If she does stand down immediately, its most likely the tories will appoint someone internally, but in the unlikely event of an election, Id say the vote would most likely go to Labour, with a very slight chance another party would win enough seats instead."

Many Conservatives are said to think that if she goes before the EU Parliamentary Election 23rd May that would be a much needed boost for Conservative candidates. But if she goes before or after the election, as far as this question is concerned, the important issue is if she is pushed by her own MPs to resign immediately or she just agrees to resign asap. When Cameron resigned replacing him with May took just under 3 weeks, but this time there is likely to be a lot more candidates, so whittling down to two will presumably take at least a few days more. And in 2016 after the MPs had reduced the candidates to 2, the other candidate (Leadsom) pulled out. If the full election process had been followed I thing it would have taken over a week and more like two weeks to have organised the required vote for all party members. So I would guess that from May announcing she was resigning to a new PM taking over would take it would probably take at least 5 or 6 weeks. There is less than 7 weeks until this question ends. It would be possible to do it faster, but presumably they would be more interested in making sure the next PM was the best person, than they would in rushing the process. The other possibility would be installing a temporary PM (who would be the new PM as far as this question is concerned) to give more time to choose the permanent replacement, but I don't see what the point would be. A temporary PM would not have authority to do anything apart from maintaining the status quo (and the EU would not want to negotiate Brexit with him/her). It could be close but if May resigns this week there is a 50% chance there will be a New Conservative PM before 1st July and for every day after that the chances drop by about 1%. We will soon find out, but Mrs May will probably last long enough that a replacement is not in office until after the end of June. (There is probably no rush, because if a new PM fancies a different EU WA that has been agreed already with the EU I doubt that the EU would be able to renegotiate before November and to do that A50 woud need to be delayed again. There are not really any good options for anyone who becomes the next PM.)"

But the Conservatives and May have no easy fixes to their problems. My guess is that May will try at least once more to get a Brexit WA thru parliament, but will fail. Maybe she will then resign. If she resigns presumably an interim PM could be appointed (e.g. Liddington) and that could be done in the next few weeks. Its more likely she won't resign but announce a date (or event) when she will resign and that will trigger an internal election in the Conservative Party which would probably mean a new PM not taking over until after the end date of this question. If May refuses to resign there will be a delay while the Conservatives argue about changed their internal rules so they can sack her. This could just about be done before July, but I suspect that many Conservative MPs would be unhappy changing the rules, so nothing will happen until the question closes. (They are called the Conservative Party after all). The other issue that will put off Conservatives sacking Mrs May is concern about who would replace her in the long term. Its very possible that Conservative Party members could elect a new Leader that does not have the confidence of enough MPs (of all parties) to form a government. To be PM you need the support of enough MPs to govern, the job is not automatically given to the leader of the biggest party in parliament (its just that the leader of the biggest party normally has the support of most MPs, by changing the way they elect their leaders the parties have made it possible that no party leader has the support of enough MPs to form a government. So to add the Brexit mess, the UK could be heading a a constitutional mess as well.)"

A Brexit deal which has a better chance of happening than her not being the PM by July 1 but that again brings up the issue of number 2 above…just not enough time to hold an election by July 1. May is unlikely to resign on the exact day the deal is struck and passed. She would likely announce her resignation as being a few weeks or months out to allow for transition for new leader and allow Tories ample time to select a new leader. 4. Some unforeseen event related to her health, an assassination or her untimely death before July 1. I can only see one outcome to this question: NO"

There was much of doubt if May remains in the office back to the period of December - January when May was facing a vote of confidence in her leadership of the Conservative Party as well as a vote of no confidence in her government. However, many things have changed. Looking from today's perspective, May time in the office mostly depends on the future of Brexit deal. As she said herself, she will leave the Prime Minister's post as soon as the agreement will be achieved between the UK and EU. On 11th April, EU and UK agreed to delay Brexit to October 31st. Therefore, it is very likely that she remains Prime Minister until then."

It would then take anything from three weeks to six weeks for the Conservatives to choose a replacement. After the mistake the Conservatives made choosing Mrs May I think the six weeks would be more likely than the three weeks, but maybe MPs are already plotting a stitch up behind the scenes to avoid letting the Party Members vote (most MPs would hate to finish up with someone like Boris, who it seems the Members like, as PM). Maybe Mrs May will refuse to resign. Its even just about possible that May's WA is voted thru parliament on the 4th or 5th try and she resigns early.

However, ultimately May will put her party and the national interest above all else and will resign if she feels it is the least worst option. It is likely that Theresa Mays foes actually want her to be scapegoated with as much baggage as possible and will want her to continue for the time being so that they can strategise and kick her out once as much damage and blame can be laid at her doorstep and hard decisions can't be inherited any more. However, a very possible very poor showing in the European elections could make the the negative noise around her so great that it will be seen by Theresa May as the reason to step down and for her foes to go in for the kill (against some of their own desires to wait) and she could step down swiftly for the sake of Brexit and her party. However, she is likely to resist this in the belief that a transition to a new leader without any form of a deal would be too much of a self inflicted wound at such a vulnerable and critical moment. She will weigh what will be the greatest cause of weakness, the noise around her or a transition to a new leader and ultimately her decision will be based on this. It could be quite likely that a strong Labour showing (possibly double the vote of the Conservatives based on initial polling) will make her position untenable and she will leave. She would be blamed for this good showing by her actions in legitimising Labour and their Brexit ideas by reaching out to them for a deal. It is unlikely that any general election poll will be called prior or after the European elections given the weak state of the parties and a transition to a new leader is the most likely outcome and therefore it is unlikely that Corbyn can get in. If a general election were held today Corbyn and Labour would win because they have now been cast in a positive light given Theresa Mays reliance on going to them and their ideas to break the impasse."

She has shown that she is incredibly inflexible and obdurate, so I do not think she will step down until either she is forced to, or some resolution has been reached on Brexit so that she can consider her job done. I think it is unlikely that either of these will happen sufficiently soon for her to be replaced by 1 July (partly because I think it would make more sense for either an election or a leadership contest to take place during the summer recess, which begins on 24 July). Therefore, I think by far the most likely outcome is that she will be in power on 1 July (though if there is either an election or a leadership contest I think she would, in practice, more or less have to stand down). If she is replaced, it is far more likely to be because she stood down as party leader than because she triggered an election, and in that case there would automatically be a Conservative replacement. And even if an election is called, it is not at all clear that Labour would claim a majority, so for those two reasons the probability of a Conservative replacement must be significantly higher than the probability of a Labour replacement. I think the prospect of a non Labour/Conservative replacement is practically zero, but have said 1% as I can't really say that there is no possibility whatsoever of that happening."

A normal person in asking for the extension would admit they had failed and resign, but Mrs May is not normal, so I suppose she will insists she is making progress, even if no one else thinks she is. And would admit that accepting an extension that could last after 30 June was concrete evidence of her failure. I see little prospect of Mrs May making any progress on Brexit, but I now doubt that she will admit it and resign. Forcing a General Election would not be good for either Conservatives or Labour,and if they both don't want to risk an election I don't see how parliament could force it. The Conservative Party can't vote out Mrs May as leader. In these strange times I suppose the whole Cabinet could resign so she has no ministers, and that might force her to resign as PM. I suppose that legally an argument could be put forward that if the WA is not passed by parliament before the end of next week then the UK could not leave the EU before 30th June. My reasoning is that for the UK to leave the EU the EU Parliament has to agree the WA, which (I believe) can only take place after the UK Parliament has approved it. As the EU parliament will not be in session after next week until July my assumption is that legally the UK cannot leave the EU until at least July because the EU Parliament (presumably) cannot agree the WA if it is not in session. So if Mrs May has said she would not accept extending A50 after 30th June, then what ever happened to her WA after next week would mean crossing her red line. So it is just possible that Mrs May would resign next week, but I would guess she would find some excuse for not resigning. I intend revising my forecast next week."

It appears then, that once she has produced a deliverable on Brexit, May will be inclined to resign — having fulfilled her objective as Prime Minister. Thus, whether May will still be Prime Minister on July 1 will likely depend on whether a Brexit agreement is finally made in the coming months. We know that having won a vote of no confidence in December, she is immune to another until the end of this year. Thus the scenarios in which May ceases to be PM in July are two fold: 1) she resigns, and 2) a snap election is called and the opposition wins."

Only one resignation was the product of a no-confidence vote and a party switch in the government after a corresponding general election. In the other 7 cases the prime ministers that took over office from the resigning precursors were members of the same party. While three of the PM resignations were connected to individual issues, such as health or scandals, the vast majority, namely 5 were related to major political decisions, 1 domestic and 4 international. Particular, interesting is that the international-related resignations were related to issues concerning either the Middle-East or Europe."

My guess is that this will for at least a year, maybe for two years. The UK will take part in the EU Parliamentary Elections in May. Backbench MPs will continue to work towards a consensus on what type of Brexit parliaments will stomach. This all needs to be done in the next two weeks. My guess is that if Mrs May gets the EU to agree the long extension to A50 she will resign, by April as no new negotiation on a new deal with the EU will take place until the autumn and she has been told by her MPs that she is not the person to lead the negotiations. The gap between now and the autumn gives a chance for the Conservatives to change the PM and figure out a plan (lack of a plan has been a problem for the last 33 months). It is possible that Mrs May might delay her resignations until after the UK local elections on 2nd May or until after the EU elections on 23rd May, but in reality there is no good time for the Conservatives to change the PM without looking weak and lacking any ideas."

My guess is that MPs could make more progress in the next 2 weeks that Mrs May has made in 2 years. So I am not sure what May would do if Brexit continues with backbench MPs in charge. Surely she would not want to hang around having lost control of the process and it being so obvious that not asking for the indicative votes in July 2016 has wasted nearly three years. Of course if the indicative votes do not work she will claim she was right all the time. So I would give her a 20% chance of hanging on until July and an 80% chance of being forced out before that.

A reason for the Conservatives not wanting a general election is that they will not have delivered anything that looks anything like the version of Brexit that they promised. The majority of core Conservative voters supported a harder Brexit than can be delivered, so they will not be happy. A large minority of core Conservative voters supported Remain and they will not be very happy with any version of Brexit.

Ways PM could avoid going. 1)Just refusing to resign and trusting that she survives without losing a confidence motion till it is too late for an election before the cut off date (so would have to make it to end of May (no pun intended) 2) Compromise (not really the style she has been showing) 3) have an election but keep her job (stronger things have happened but not much) 4)staying on in name only. A lot of this comes down to at what point a group could be brought together to bring the government down it would be a gamble for at least some of the people who would have to lose confidence. I have to introduce a chaos factor to draw the chance of eventualities closer together (30%). Given a 7/16 Government falling by 25th May (it took 37 days in 1979 from lost vote to new PM) to 9/16 chance of government surviving. In the election the Conservatives would likely still be the largest party 5/6 (likely in a minority government needing a coalition) almost any situation is going to allow the partner to request May resign so if they don't get a majority May would have a 1/5 chance of survival boosted however by the possibility of delay so 2/5 [the leadership contest could be done in preparation for the election if a clear candidate emerged or a caretaker was appointed NOTE you do not have to be party leader to be prime minister]. So: 70% x 7/16 x 5/6 x 1/2 12% for May after the election 12 % another Conservative 5% Labour from the Government falls scenario. If Government survives it is hard to see who would want he job but the desire for power or the country/ party might be desperate I'll say 13/20. So: 70% x 9/16 x 13/20 so extra 26% for Different Conservative and 14 % for May. I'll split the chaos factor 9,9,9,3% 14+12+9=35% For May. 26+12+9=47% for another Conservative. 5+9=14%. I then knocked off 3% from Labour Candidate because I think I over rated the contribution of Chaos to help them but I can't be bothered to re calculate."

Her attempt to directly address the ""people"" and blame parliament for the Brexit mess went down very badly with MPs, and it is the votes of the MPs, not the ""people"" that she needs to get her WA through parliament. MPs were angry that May said that MPs had not said what they wanted, just what they did not want, when it has been Mrs May who has been blocking them from having free votes on any options (free votes being ones where MPs are allowed to vote according to what they think as opposed to whipped votes where they have to vote according to party directions.) The EU has upped the anti by taking Mrs May at her word (that she would not agree to a long extension) and offering only a shorter extension that she asked for (to May 22nd not June 30th) and said no further extension to that could happen. I might be completely deluded, but this looks like negotiating tactics by both Mrs May and the EU. Both want to see who blinks first; the EU, Mrs May or MPs. Polling shows that the UK public blame the UK government for the mess and Mrs May specifically. An online petition from UK voters to parliament calling for A50 to be revoked has been crashing all day because of an unprecedented volume of traffic. Parliament has now rejected the WA twice and instructed Mrs May to avoid a No Deal. It is possible but very unlikely that parliament will cave in and now vote for what MPs have already judged to be bad deal. And some of those who voted against the WA want no deal, so are not going to change their votes to avoid no deal. The EU is very unlikely to back down. Parliament might take control of events from Mrs May in the next few days. It is believed that the EU would agree to a long extension of A50 if for good reason, but if Mrs May refuses to request it then MPs could (without needing government permission or the PMs agreement) revoke A50 (a court case established in was in parliaments power). The bottom line is that its difficult to see how May can survive unless she get her WA voted through."

In my opinion May has given up on concluding Brexit. It seem obvious that she has no idea how once the Withdrawal Agreement gets through parliament she could get the Future Relationship agreed with the EU and Parliament. The problem she has created for herself is that the Political Statement that is attached to the WA, which was supposed to be the Framework for the Future Relationship is no such thing. It is just as an aspirational wish list of contradictory statement that could never be delivered as a Free Trade Deal with the EU. It would be far harder to get any agreement than the WA has been. I think even Mrs May must realise that, and if she does not most Conservative MPs must realise its is beyond her. So I think that once either May's WA is through parliament or has been finally killed off and replaced by another WA and Political Statement Mrs May will resign as PM. This could happen by the end of this month. I would expect that if A50 has to be extended for longer than a few weeks, the EU will want the UK to provide a plan of what it intends to do. I don't expect the EU will give anything but a ""short extension"" to clear up loose ends if May's WA get through parliament by 29th March. If this happens I would expect Mrs May to resign by June. If Mrs May cannot get her WA through parliament the EU will not give a ""short extension"" to A50, but would need to give a ""long extension"" to allow an alternative WA and Political Statement to be negotiated. After failing with her WA and Political Statement (not getting it approved by parliament) there would be no point in her staying on as PM to produce another WA that no one wants, so I assume she would have to do the honourable thing and resign (if she did not the Conservative Party could split apart). So I see no point in her staying on as PM after 29th March. So either way she is likely to be on her way out quite soon. I don't see a general election as being likely, so the next PM is almost certain to be another Conservative."

This is the most time accurate, geographical and situational baseline that can be find on this forecast. Nevertheless, in the next days a unique event will see its final phases, namely Brexit. The day in which it will happen - as analyzed in the forecast about the Article 50's extension - depends basically from Theresa May's ability to draft a program for Brexit which finds the Parliament's agreement. Her success or failure in driving her country into a successful or failing Brexit will determine much of her resilience as Prime Minister. If the Brexit process will be moved after the 1 July, it's unlikely that she will have to face another non-confidence vote, as at least her party can't constitutionally invoke another no-confidence vote until next December (I would give this outcome a 60% probability, in line with the already mentioned forecast). If Brexit will happen before the 1st of July, there's going to be a no-deal Brexit or a Brexit based on a deal the UK Parliament didn't like at all (https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47547887). In both cases, it is very unlikely that Theresa May will stay in her position (I would say a 10% probability). Adding this last case with the probability of the Brexit deal to be postponed (60%), it's explained why I gave a 70% probabilty to the no answer to the forecast. Let's now move to the cluster of possibilities deriving from the possibility of Thresa May being removed from her office. The UK's electoral system, without explaining the details, basically advantages the big parties, which is the reason why from the very beginning of the elections in this country only two factions basically had an alternance to the government (at the beginning the division was Tories-Whigs, nowadays it's Liberal-Conservatives, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_Kingdom_general_elections). Both the major parties showed their fluctuating trust in Theresa May, but I think it's much more likely that, in case of Theresa May deposed from her office, the opposite party she represent will form a new goverment."

The Brexit Secretary told begged parliament to vote for the government and then voted against what he had begged MPs to do. Clearly May has no shame or she would have resigned already. Clearly Conservative MPs have no shame propping up the most dysfunctional government ever.

To have a general election Conservative MPs would need to vote for it. That is very unlikely while Mrs May is the PM because her MPs will remember how she turned a good lead in the polls, before she called the 2017 general election, into losing the Conservative majority by the time the election took place. While Corbyn is Labour leader is seems very unlikely that Labour would win an election. So any election that took place would probably result in Conservatives and Labour both losing votes and the result being very unpredictable (e.g. low turn out? More votes going to other parties, who may or may not actually win many more seats, a hung parliament?). What would happen in Scotland for example? Scotland voted to Remain, but neither May nor Corbyn has done anything to accommodate Scottish wishes to Remain or at least stay close to the EU, and to keep the EU Freedom of Movement. The SNP is a Remain party in a Remain country, so could pick up some more seats. It is possible that Mrs May could resign if she manages to get an EU Withdrawal Deal agree by parliament. Probably that will not happen before 29th March, and if it did A50 would almost certainly need to be extended past 29th March . But as soon as the UK leaves the EU (if it in fact does) Mrs May could resign and the Conservatives would electe a new leader, who would automatically become PM. My guess is the odds are about 35% that the EU Withdrawal Deal will be passed before 1st July."

It never looked very likely that the no confidence vote would pass. Conservatives MPs don't want May to lead them into another election, and unless May resigns they cannot get rid of her. Labour says it will keep trying to call for No Confidence motions, but other parties say they will not support Labour unless something changes, so they are unlikely to be successful. So a change of PM before July seems to rely on Mrs May resigning. Any normal person would have already resigned when faced with the public humiliation of her Brexit plans being voted down by a record vote. (I doubt that even she who keeps telling us that Brexit was voted for by more citizens than any other vote in UK history, will want to add that her Brexit deal was rejected by more votes against the government than any other bill in UK history.) So when this PM seemingly impervious to humiliation will accept that she has failed and does not have the ability to succeed in her self defined version of Brexit, and decides to call it a day is very difficult to forecast. Will it be when she has to withdraw her red lines? Will it be when she is forced to ask for an extension to AS0? Will it be when she has to bin her Brexit deal and go to the EU and ask them to consider an alternative approach? She already knows a third of Conservatives MPs don't want her as PM. She now knows 48% of MPs don't want her as PM."

I think if the deal passes, May would would stay. If the deal fails to pass, there are 3 days to come up with the so-called 'Plan B', but I don't think there is much ground to be gained with the EU in that timeframe. So I actually see 'Plan B' failing to pass the Commons at 90% probability, factoring in that there might not even be a vote. What could change that is May threatening the no deal scenario, but I would think that she would face a vote of no confidence soon after that attempt. With plan B rejected, think it is certain that a vote of no confidence that allows for general elections in time before the question closes will follow. Given a vote of no confidence in time, I see a 95% probability of May/the government loosing that vote (in this scenario neither the deal nor Plan B passed). For general elections, I reduced the chance of a PM from neither big parties to 0, and have Labour and Conservatives at 50:50 to win the election, in line with polling data that shows them very close. Following the branches and some arithmetic gives me the forecast."

If there was a General Election today, and Labour ran with the leader it currently has (Corbyn) and with a manifesto that is the same as its current policy (which includes ""to deliver Brexit"") it difficult to see how it could get more seats in parliament than it has now. Corbyn is seen by those who did not vote Labour in the 2017 as a good example of a 1960s socialist who has had no new ideas in the last 50 years, and is incapable of responding to the world of today. If they had felt Corbyn had anything to offer then they would have voted Labour in 2017. On the other hand there is a growing number of people who voted Labour in 2017 hoping that Corbyn really believed in letting Labour Party Members set the parties policies. but It has become clear that Corbyn's belief in policies set by the people, is as sincerely held by him as it was by Chairman Mao, Stalin, and Mrs May (i.e. the ""people's"" best interests are better served by an all knowing leader, than by taking any notice of the ""people"") The advantage the Conservatives should have if an election were called before July is that presumably they would not be lead by Mrs May, who shares many of the faults that Corbyn has (does not know how to listen and change her policies, or how to lead - by which I mean, the ability to understand an issue, work with experts to formulate a possible solution and then sell that solution to people who had different ideas, in order that the solution is implemented.) In an election of Corbyn vs May the ineptitude of both would cancel each other out and the result could go either way, although Corbyn would have the advantage that as he has never held any government post voters have not had concrete evidence of how bad he would be. May on the other hand has been PM and there is lots of evidence how bad she is. So in an election without May the Conservatives could have picked a competent leader with some ideas, which would be a great advantage and could attract wide support and give them a win. But the chances are that the Conservatives could replace May by leader who is as bad as May, and if the Conservative Party Members get their say they would likely pick someone as leader who is a lot worse, and would appeal to no one except the (few) Conservative Party Member. As Conservative MPs are (slightly) more sensible that the Conservative Members they will do all they can to avoid letting the Members pick a new leader. The easiest way to do this is refuse to vote for a General Election. Therefore my conclusion is that unless May resigns she will remain as PM because the only way to get rid of her by July would be for Conservative MPs to join the opposition in voting her out. They will not want to vote her out in fear of a worse leader (the Leavers fear another Remainer, Remainers fear a Leaver). If the Conservatives are forced to elect a new leader then its a 50/50 chance that leader will have very little appeal to the wider electorate."

If the vote of confidence fails, a Labour-led cross-party majority would probably legislate for a referendum as a means to extend Article 50, thereby extending May's leadership until it's through.

In both cases May was defeated due to senior Conservatives working with opposition parties. In normal circumstances a PM would be expected to resign if this were to happen. Mrs May's argument over the last six months is that there is no other plan than to vote for her deal. Today's amendment, that was passed, requires her to present an alternative plan within three (working) days of losing the vote on her Brexit Deal. The expectation is that that vote will occur next Tuesday and that May will lose it. Therefore she would need to present a new plan of action to parliament by 21st Jan. There are several things that could happen; (a) May could present a new plan, but a vote of no confidence in the government is called (b) May could herself call for a vote of confidence (c) parliament could present its own (cross party) plan and order May to carry out parliaments wishes. A confidence vote seems very likely, but May could win it by agreeing to do what parliament wants. The is big risk for both Labour and Conservatives is that it is very unclear which party would win a general election and its very unclear what the new PM that would inevitably be the result would do. The Conservatives could end up with their Members electing a new PM that could not control the Conservative MPs any better than May. If the Government entered a general election with May remaining as their candidate for PM its difficult to see how the Conservative MPs who had just expressed they had no confidence in her could back her. If May was still PM presumably her manifesto would be ""vote Conservative so we can pass the May Deal"", but as only around 25% of the public want the May Deal this hardly looks like an election winner. The alternative if May was still PM would be on a manifesto of ""vote for the Plan B which I have been telling you for months is not possible"". That does not sound like a winner either. Labour has a similar problem with the additional problem that the polls show them less popular than the Conservatives, so presumably to have a chance of winning an election they would need to change their Brexit policy (to being clearly against Brexit in the eyes of Remainers, but somehow being pro-Brexit in the eyes of Leavers. That seems to leave a very narrow policy option of the Norway+/Common Market 2.0) e.g. technical outside the EU, but with most of the advantages (and disadvantages) https://labourlist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Common-Market-2.0.pdf My guess is that an election will not take place, that A50 will be extended so a revised Withdrawal Agreement can be drawn up, and that a new detailed Political Statement for a new deal (quite likely based on Common Market 2.0) can be drawn up, and then a public vote to chose between Common Market 2.0 or remaining in the EU. (Other option such as No Deal Brexit will not get through parliament, a Canada ++ FT deal will cannot provide the frictionless trade needed to keep the Irish border as it is."

According to party rules, another vote may only be held after 1 year. A Vote of No Confidence could be triggered by Labour, but given Labour's 229 seats in Parliament (of 650), they would need a minimum of 34.5% of Conservatives to support, assuming all Lib Dems and other party members support the motion, which is highly unlikely. 3) Agreement for a new general election: this would require 2/3 vote of all MPs - extremely unlikely, given the split in Parliament."

There cannot be much chance that she can get her EU Withdrawal bill through parliament (close to 0%) and if she does not surely she should resign (10%). If she does not resign surely Corbyn would call for a Parliamentary Vote of No Confidence (30%) which he might or might not win (50% win). If May won a Parliamentary Vote she could carry on, if not she has a couple of weeks to try and sure up her support before having another vote. So there is only about a 20% chance that May would lose both No Confidence Votes. Even if she does lose both she is still in the game because then there would need to be a General Election and according to the polls the Conservatives could still be the biggest party (not because May is viewed as a good PM, but because Corbyn is not viewed as potentially a good PM). My feeling (based on no data) is that more voters could hold their nose and vote Labour to stop May, than could hold their nose and vote Conservative to get May, but this might be because most people I talk to see Corbyn as useless, but May as dangerous. Corbyn's mistakes could be put right later, May's would last for a generation. So my thinking is if May can get past a Parliamentary No Confidence Vote she could hang on. If she loses a Parliamentary No Confidence Vote she might hang on in an election. Although May has got a lot of Conservatives MPs who have no confidence in her, they see that voting No Confidence in the Government (as opposed to voting No Confidence in May as Conservative Leader) would probably mean Corbyn became PM and there was a Labour government. So Conservative MPs are unlikely to vote with the opposition in a Parliamentary No Confidence Vote, An additional reason for Conservatives not to vote No Confidence in the Government is that the outcome could lead to a General Election in which MPs could lose their seats. But its difficult to see how May could command day to day control of her party if she fails to get the Withdrawal Agreement through, and difficult to see how she gets thrown out!"

May may resign BEFORE Conservatives vote for a new leader: the acting leader and PM will be conservative 2. May may resign AFTER Conservatives vote for a new leader at May's request, in preparation for an imminent election: the acting leader will be conservative 3. A vote of no confidence may trigger the 45-60 day election process in time for a new PM July 1st,, i.e., start by early in the month of May: (a) Conservatives prepare by having a new leader, or (b) Conservatives lose with May, to a Labour-led coalition, or (c) Conservatives win with May, then appoint a new leader after July 1st, or, little chance, (d) a new alliance leader emerges. 4. The election process is initiated after mid-May, and PM May hangs on into 3Q19. A game-changer will likely happen in 1Q19; the easiest to imagine is a cascade of political moves to the centre, possibly with a delay in Parliament's vote on the only Brexit plan which is currently on the table. At the far end of the scale of possibilities: another referendum initiated (6 months, minimum) - Brexit delayed; prorogued government; preemptive changes in party leadership."

If the Conservatives are the biggest party in parliament the queen could invite another Conservative to try and form a government. May could resign and the Conservatives could elect a new leader. This seems unlikely. Its difficult to see how Corbyn would become PM without a general election taking place. A long shot would be parliament taking control and forming a cross party group to sort out Brexit. In this case as the Conservatives are the biggest party the PM could be a Conservative.

Parliament could vote in a new PM without a general election. They could also decide to call a general election even though they don't have to (I estimate 70% probability for this). If the vote of no confidence in the government as a whole is successful, there has to be a general election. 4) In case of a general election, assuming that it will be a tight race, so 50% Conservatives win, 49% Labour wins, 1% other (see below) (http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/ , thanks @Futureseeker) 5) In either a general election or new PM election case, I am assuming an outside chance of 1% for PM from neither of the big parties."
