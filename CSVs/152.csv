The professional forecasters (Cook, et al) are a little more conservative in their estimates, which range anywhere from ""lean"" to ""likely"" Democrat. I found a PBS news article portraying this race as the ""most competitive in Arizona."" It cited 538, and I wondered if we were looking at the same site. Given, this article was published a couple weeks ago, but Stanton had an even greater probability of winning on the date in question, with a projected popular vote margin of 10 points. I'll keep my eyes on this one, but I doubt it's going to suddenly get competitive down the stretch."
