The answer to question (1) seems to be a resounding yes. While the size of relief is up for debate, policy makers have expressed a bipartisan consensus that some relief is needed, with very few dissenters. Regarding (2), while Democratic legislation includes well over $100 billion for states and local governments, Republican legislation includes close to none. A more recent $1.3 trillion plan has been discussed, but the details are still private. Given that the original CARES act included over $300 billion for states and local governments, I put the probability of (2) at 70%. Regarding (3), the federal fiscal year ends on September 30th. While there is nothing forcing a bill to be passed by then, this date may serve as a 'soft' deadline for the relief bill. However, these budget decisions often extend to the final day and last minute. Therefore, I assign a 10% probability to (3). This yields a 7% probability overall."
95332,2020-09-07T22:30:35Z,1,[4.0],[4.0],"There's really not a great way to quantify this. Seems like news is largely negative/pessimistic about cooperation on a relief bill, and Congress has a lot of other stuff to worry about, including the upcoming election (https://www.startribune.com/hopes-fading-for-coronavirus-deal-as-congress-returns/572340112/). This article (https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/09/01/stimulus-package-senate-republicans/#51dbe90d7770) provides a pretty good summary of the current bills in play (notably, the Republican bill doesn't include state/local aid). There's a lot of contention, and both sides don't seem keen on crossing the aisle to compromise. I'm currently at 4%, since we'll see what Congress focuses on tomorrow/this week, but I think the probability of a result within the next two weeks is quite slim. If there's no significant news over the next week, I'll probably lower to 1 or even 0 percent."

However, the new relief bill has turned into a very political discussion that seeks to win voters for either side, thus both parties are quite strongly opinionated and are much less willing to look for a compromise. Furthermore, the parties are much more focused on the individual relief bill (individual as in voter) and are less interested in the state financial assistance.

However, looking at a historical base rate from here: https://www.gao.gov/assets/320/317235.pdf, only 3/6 recessions have the feds provided any assistance to state/local governments and only in 2009 was the aid arguably more than $100bn.

Additionally, the president's anger towards bailing out cities and states (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/us/politics/trump-funding-cities.html) while they are experience civil unrest means that the GOP is even more unlikely to concede and agree to some sort of bailout any time soon. As we move closer to the election, it seems possible that such unrest will continue, which in turn could generate more instances of police brutality and thus even more protests/unrest.
