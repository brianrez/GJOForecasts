"Between 11 March 2022 and 9 September 2022, will Russia publicly announce that it has moved nuclear weapons into either Belarus or Ukraine?",2022-03-11T18:00:00Z,2022-09-10T07:01:00Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']","['Technology', 'Foreign Policy', 'Security and Conflict']",886,654,254,237,,https://www.gjopen.com/questions/2314-between-11-march-2022-and-9-september-2022-will-russia-publicly-announce-that-it-has-moved-nuclear-weapons-into-either-belarus-or-ukraine
107275,2022-09-10T01:10:12Z,1,[1.0],[1.0],"While it is true that back in June Putin declared that Russia would move nuclear weapons into Belarus (source: https://www.usip.org/publications/2022/06/possible-russian-nuclear-deployments-belarus-could-shift-europes-nuclear), the probability that this will come to fruition by the closing date of this question in 6 hours is vanishingly close to zero. However, the fact that this question still retains a consensus view of only 97% ""no"" indicates to me that there may be some evidence I am not considering. Perhaps, the seemingly arbitrary closing date of this question (September 10) has some relevance in Russia or in the Russian army and that is swaying agreement by 3%. Or, perhaps, the 3% is indicative of earlier disagreement when this question first opened. Maybe then, people believed that the chances of Russia moving nukes was x = 50% or even x > 50%, and those early predictions have tilted the average today. Of course, I cannot assign a value of 0% to this question, because the probability of a Russia nuclear transit by early tomorrow morning eventuality is not equal to 0, but I have near full confidence that this will not occur within the next 6 hours, and therefore, assign a value of 1%."

There's also be Russian bombing near Ukraine's nuclear site. I suspect Russia would use bio/chemical or compromise Ukraine's nuclear site before deploying a nuclear weapon. If the conflict draws out and Russia doesn't have an option to 'save face' then I would suspect the probability of deploying a nuclear weapon increases.

It would only be a highly viable version of sabre rattling for either provocation or deterrence 3) will Putin want to escalate? Very difficult to predict as no one yet know if Putin has gone bonkers, feels he has a meeting with destiny to fulfil because he is ill, is working on some obscure plan which we don’t understand yet or has just been getting bad advice because of his isolation, or thing have not gone expected because the capability they thought was there was not because of corruption in the army. As we can cee too many variables to be sure at the moment."
