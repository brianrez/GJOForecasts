Few hours to Egypts president Al-Sisi deadline for a ceasefire between GNA forces in the outskirts of Sirte and LNA forces inside Sirte Libya. We might see Egypts #military intervention. Raising some. It could be a bluff. Greece supports Hafter and some harsh words between Greece and Turkey too. Raising some. Note: Turkey not yet committing a lot of its own troops yet.

ACLED lists eight incidents involving Turkish troops in Libya since the beginning of their engagement there, none of which have resulted in a confirmed Turkish fatality. First I try to estimate the true probability of a lethal incident involving Turkish armed forces with the modified Wald method. That's (0+2)/(8+4) = 16%, ± 0.20, so a 95% CI that the true proportion is between 0 and 36%. This is interesting because according to ACLED, just around 16% of confrontations involving Turkish troops in Syria have involved a fatality on any side. The mean number of fatalities for lethal incidents in Syria is 5. Unfortunately, ACLED doesn't tell us which side the fatalities are on, but let's make a simplifying (if unrealistic) assumption of parity; 18% of all fatal incidents involving Turkish troops in Syria involve more than 8 fatalities. So the probability that there will be a fatal incident resulting in at least 8 casualties is then 16% * 18%... so closer to 2%. This degree of calculation is really unwarranted, but I will lower my initial estimate on its basis."

That is a higher rate of loss than experienced by forces in Afghanistan (a reasonable comparable) https://www.statista.com/statistics/262894/western-coalition-soldiers-killed-in-afghanistan/.

Situations in East Mediterranean, Syria and Ukraine are the main stages that determine the future of Libyan conflict. Some of the dynamics driving the level of tensions in these three stages are mainly political, diplomatic and economic. We know Haftar is well supported by Russia because Russia needs to have control over the supply of oil (due to sanctions). Kremlin related Wagner troops have been fighting for Haftar. On the other hand Turkey had no choice but to support Sarraj because Greek and Cypriot EEZ advancements threatened its sovereign rights over its continental shelf. So, it sought sea neighbors to back its EEZ claims to cancel Greek EEZ claims. Russia also backs Assad in Syria. Turkey is against Assad. In Syria, Russia and Turkey are disputing over Idlib province. Because of this dispute a military confrontation began lately and resulted with TSK casualties. Although Russia's aim toward Idlib is more complex (securing Iran's Latakia settlement to relieve pressure on Russian military settlements in Tartus) than it seems, it directed SAA to use more lethal force than usual on Turkish positions in the most recent counteroffensives. The reason for that was Russia's loss of 4 FSB special operations agents during Turkish led offensive toward Aleppo. So, that makes TSK casualties are result of a Russian retaliation. This means the risk of heightened conflict in Idlib may actually be lower than expected. However, the exchange of attacks led Turkey to take political steps in Ukraine. Turkey expressed support for Kiev and stated that it would not recognize Crimea as Russian territory. Turkey also beefed up its observation points in Idlib. Ankara stated that Syrian army and whoever are with them would be hit hard unless Syrian army retreat back to the line agreed in Sochi. Russian sponsored Haftar had left negotiations after Turkey insisted on conditions of ceasefire which Moscow also had disagreed in some terms. This shows Haftar does what Kremlin tells him to do. There have been Turkish attacks in Libya against Haftar positions. Russian drones were downed outside Tripoli by Turkey backed groups, again in retaliation of similar Haftar offensives. Turkey deployed some radical proxies from idlib to Tripoli and sent armed vehicles and tanks. Such steps were to pose deterrence for Kremlin, which has been fighting in many other theaters in various different regions. Despite all these developments, we have not yet seen a serious all-out offensive has been taken against Turkish positions by Haftar. One of the most important reasons for that is Kremlin's understanding that Turkish soldiers are protecting and supporting a UN recognized government in Libya, and that any attack on Turkish troops would risk Haftar's legitimacy, therefore would undermine Russia's gains in Libya. Turkey is using its own troops mainly for conducting training, arming and consulting missions for Sarraj army in Libya. In turn, its military existence is much smaller in size compared to Idlib. This is also a factor lowering the possibility of casualties from Turkish side. However, if, by the end of this month Assad forces do not retreat back to the line Ankara has mentioned, there is a likelihood that a Turkish offensive in response may cause some Russian casualties on Syrian side, an answer to which may be coupled by Haftar's heavy artillery to Tripoli, resulting Turkish casualties. So there's still a possibility of a lethal confrontation that may result in 8 or more deaths from TSK side in Libya.The main determinant for that likelihood will be Syrian army's position at the end of this month (Feb 2020) and the Turkish response to that. US support for Turkish offensive, as well as Turkey's geographical advantage may deter Russia which may result with Assad's retreat back to Sochi line. I believe the likelihood of a lethal conflict causing deaths of Turkish troops in Libya will remain low within the next 5 months because diplomatic relations between Kremlin and Ankara aren't damaged as severe for Russia to order an attack on UN recognized government's positions which most of the Turkish troops are located at."

The Turks - with a economic and ideological interest - are attempting to do just enough to prevent Haftar's advance while maintaining a small, defensible footprint. The Turks will likely attempt to avoid direct confrontation between Turkish forces and opposition forces, but their adversaries (particularly the LNA) will likely see a strike on Turkish forces that results in casualties a way to hinder Turkish public support for the operation and possibly force a withdrawal. Eight casualties isn't especially high (a car bomb or well-placed airstrike could cause that). When we say Turkish Armed Forces, does that count proxies? My probability would increase if it does. Without knowing exact Turkish troop numbers in Libya, it is hard to be precise."

84424,2020-02-11T22:57:18Z,1,[60.0],[60.0],"Given the report of casualties in January (3 Turkish soldiers killed and 6 injured) and the increase in conventional force deployment (https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/32002/two-turkish-frigates-appear-of-libya-amid-reports-of-troops-and-armor-landing-ashore), in which 2 Turkish frigates are reported to have offloaded troops and armor onto the coast of Tripoli; I believe it is highly likely that the increase in Turkish presence and likely increase in aggressive posture will lead to an increase in combat casualties. I believe that the deployment of armored assets indicates that Turkey is preparing for offensive operations, which will certainly lead to casualties, given the amount of territory and apparent close air support capability held by General Haftar's forces."
84608,2020-02-11T21:33:48Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],"With recent deaths in Syria and under domestic political pressure, it is unlikely that Erdogan will attempt to move Turkish troops into an aggressive posture in Libya, therefore reducing the likelihood of casualties (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51447114). According to Erdogan, Turkey has only sent 35 advisors, however, this should not be taken for granted as Turkish special forces are also likely operating in AO (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/13/turbulence-for-turkey-as-breakaway-parties-make-gains-on-erdogan). Just five days after the deployment, 3 Turkish soldiers were allegedly killed and another 6 were wounded when a rebel aircraft backed by the UAE bombed their position (https://ahvalnews.com/libya/three-turkish-soldiers-killed-libya-haftars-forces-advance-misrata). With modern weapons and warplanes, Libyan rebel groups have the capabilities to pose a threat to Turkish advisors even behind the frontlines (https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/nation-world/story/2020-01-04/death-toll-from-airstrike-in-libyas-tripoli-climbs-to-30). With Turkish backed Syrian fighters in the region, I predict more violence but I am hesitant to argue that uniformed Turkish forces will be present."

Have a look at ACLED data from last April to today: average fatalities from a violent incident has been 1.7 killed, and these figures are skewed by the existence of 10 fatalities recording when deaths are unknown. None involved foreign military personnel from what I can see."
