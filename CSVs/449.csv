Some of that is to be expected due to reopening and a surge in demand, but I think there's plenty of possibility for reversion to the mean here. For one, stimulus checks went out in mid March. I think there's a good chance May could drop down from the March and April numbers since those might have been juiced by stimulus checks. I do think there is a lot of potential for high numbers this holiday season, but the effects of reopening might be counteracted a bit by the fact that we've been above trend and the effects of stimulus checks might fade."

With that in mind it seems most likely that it will fall in a similar range so I'll put most weight in the 2.5-5% bin. I suppose it could go either way past there; increased travel expenses could lower retail spending, or increased prices, savings, and wages could bump it up. This might be a very boring prediction but I'll just do a curve out from the middle and see how the year progresses"
