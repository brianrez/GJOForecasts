The five-day moving averages for the Oman crude oil 1st–3rd spread approached 50 cents/b in late November, and Brent’s spread settled at -4 cents/b on December 3. The WTI spread also increased, but by less than the other crude oils. The increasing crude oil price spreads reflect both the global oil inventory drawdown since June 2020 as well as expectations for increasing demand and continued stock draws in the coming months. Higher Oman crude oil price spreads, which generally reflect Middle Eastern crude oil exported to Asia, could reflect increasing demand and refinery runs from China, India, or other Asian countries. China’s National Bureau of Statistics reported that crude oil refinery runs in China reached an all-time high of 14.1 million b/d in October. Based on data from India’s Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, EIA estimates that India’s total petroleum consumption was 4.6 million b/d in October 2020, the most of any month since February."

They have a direct relationship so even when Brent does fall WTI stays behind. I dont have access to Bloomberg and dont have much other information about oil.

68929,2020-11-15T20:38:58Z,1,[68.0],[68.0],"Even though WTI crude is landlocked the pressures on American oil will increase as climate change affects the landscape of this area. I believe micro factors will increase the values (i.e., insurance costs and political shifts to increase green options, etc) which will exert pressures that make the cost of the WTI crude the cheapest it will be for some time. Therefore the price will rise with a slight uptick overtime. On the flip side I feel the north sea Brent crude oil will increase its ability to ship cheaper due to COVID. As shipping costs like commercial real estate will be looking for new markets they will find ways to cuts cost to market, to be more competitive even using smaller lines who want a piece of this piece to stay afloat, or possibility even using drones to load and unload cargo. So I believe the Brent cruse prices will tick down marginally over time. The aggregate will be up for WTI and down for Brent ever so slightly but on a trend so the on-balance will be not huge, but measurable."
