88452,2022-04-21T16:14:14Z,4,[100.0],[0.0],"Inflation has increased markedly since the middle of 2021, reaching 7.5% in March according to the flash estimate. This increase is largely driven by energy prices, which have been strongly affected by the war in Ukraine. Food prices also increased due to elevated transport and production costs, notably the higher price of fertilisers which was also impacted by the war. Further upward pressure arises from supply bottlenecks and the recovery in demand as the economy reopens. The impact of these factors should fade over time, but in the short run inflationary risks are tilted to the upside. Inflation will be higher if the prices of energy and other commodities increase further and new supply bottlenecks arise. Over the medium-term, risks to the inflation outlook could arise if wages rise by more than anticipated, longer-term inflation expectations move above target or supply conditions durably worsen. At the same time, weaker demand could reduce pressure on prices. So far, however, wage growth has remained muted – despite a strong labour market – and inflation expectations in the euro area stand around our target, although initial signs of above-target revisions in those measures warrant close monitoring. We continue to carefully monitor risks to the inflation outlook."

The central bank will likely maintain its pledge for a faster withdrawal of stimulus and eventually setting a clear schedule for ending QE, while reiterating that interest rate increases will only come after the end of the asset purchase programme (APP). Since its meeting last month, inflationary pressures continued to mount and the war in Ukraine is far from over while further sanctions on Russia, including a potential ban on energy, are expected to continue to pressure prices even higher and slow the economic recovery. Markets now price in a combined 70 basis points of hikes in the ECB's minus 0.5% deposit rate this year, according to Reuters. In March, the ECB surprisingly speed up the asset purchase schedule for the coming months and said that the APP could end in the third quarter if the medium-term inflation outlook will not weaken."" https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/interest-rate"
