With no incumbent in the race, it's not super surprising neither candidate has a demanding lead, but when the rubber hits the road the GOP candidate will almost definitely get a boost on the ballot given the historical trends in the area. In fact, Dems haven't won a seat there since 1932! He also has the support of a lot of powerful organizations. The one exception, though, is Donald Trump, who has thus far refused to interfere in the election despite Senate Republicans' requests. However, voters for Trump are unlikely to vote for any Democratic candidate, and it is highly likely that if the situation does not improve Trump will give into pressure and endorse him. Basically, though it's close in the polls, it is difficult to see a clear path to victory for the Dem candidate without using the word 'miracle.'"
