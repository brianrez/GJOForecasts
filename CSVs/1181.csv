Despite the fact that Gorsuch and Thomas joined the most liberal justices in the majority on this case, being arguably the two most conservative justices, they are unlikely to take an actual stance against gerrymandering (especially since a large majority of state legislative bodies that draw the districts are controlled by Republicans). But more tellingly, Roberts' and Breyer's dissent indicates some antagonism towards the anti-gerrymandering cause. Breyer may likely switch sides, but this case was a bit of a litmus test for Roberts for whom liberals are holding out hope that might deliver them a victory. So his reluctance puts a bit of a damper on the two cases in this question. The mix-up here and in 2 other recent also means there's a lot of uncertainty in the current leanings of the court. And interestingly, an identical decision in both cases would produce a victory apiece for Republicans and Democrats. It's a messy situation, but I'd put my money on a bit less than 50-50."

Federal district court strikes down Ohio congressional district plan as unconstitutional partisan gerrymander A three-judge panel of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio ruled unanimously that Ohio's congressional district plan constitutes an illegal partisan gerrymander. The court held that the plan, enacted in 2011 by a Republican legislature and governor, violates the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of Democrats. The panel, comprised of Judges Karen Moore (appointed by Democrat Bill Clinton), Timothy Black (appointed by Democrat Barack Obama), and Michael Watson (appointed by Republican George W. Bush), enjoined the state from conducting any future congressional elections under the 2011 plan. The court ordered the state to enact a remedial plan by June 14, 2019. Should the state fail to meet this deadline, or should the state's remedial plan fail to meet the approval of the court, the court may appoint a special master to draft a remedial plan. This marks the second time in as many weeks that federal courts have struck down district plans as unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders. On April 25, 2019, a three-judge panel of the United District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan ruled unanimously that 34 Michigan congressional and state legislative districts had been subject to unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering, violating Democrats' First Amendment associational rights. The court also found that 27 of the 34 challenged districts violated the Democrats' First and Fourteenth Amendment rights by diluting the impact of their votes. The phrase partisan gerrymandering refers to the practice of drawing electoral district maps with the intention of favoring one political party over another. In contrast with racial gerrymandering, on which issue the Supreme Court of the United States has made rulings in the past affirming that such practices violate federal law, the high court has not, to date, made a ruling establishing clear precedent on the question of partisan gerrymandering. Two partisan gerrymandering cases—Rucho v. Common Cause and Benisek v. Lamone—are pending before the high court this term. Rulings are expected by the end of June."

On the merits, and under principles of equal protection and free speech, the SCOTUS has routinely found State sanctioned political discrimination to be inappropriate and constitutionally protected in analogous circumstances. The more liberal justices will almost certainly vote to overturn these politically cynical power-grabs, that deliberately aim to (and effectively do) minimize the effective voting power of an entire political group. That said, mired factual questions about what a state legislature's ""predominant purpose"" is from year to year in redistricting maps threatens to place judges and juries far too often in a position of constant review of potentially political questions, which conservative jurists are ordinarily hesitant to indulge."

On the other hand, the conservative bloc is weary of the thought of gerrymandering cases haunting the court without any visible end to it. The conservatives has many times hinted that although racial gerrymandering is an unfortunate thing, but it is not for the courts to decide this question. No feasible and objective standard to determine just how much racial factor in a gerrymandered electoral map must be there for it to be considered unconstitutional, can be found. It lies in the end on the current center of the court - CJ John Roberts and in my estimation, he will either side with the conservatives to end the racial gerrymandering cases from being taken up by courts once and for all or duck the question again for another day.
