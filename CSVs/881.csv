I don't think we'll crack the 1M mark before 1 September, much less the 2M mark. There are a lot of factors influencing this assessment. In no particular order: high jobless rates have reduced discretionary income for travel; continuing bans on American travelers overseas has caused many folks to cancel flights out for vacations; some are reluctant to travel domestically due to infection spikes in other states, and domestic traveler two-week quarantines imposed by various states, etc.; and many businesses have moved toward online meetings rather than travel, further reducing demand for flights.

I still think the 200,000 mark will not be hit until after September first, but I have to give some weight to August and even July. I should (and will later) do a more rigorous analysis with a normal distribution with increasing mean, but I think if the mean is close to 1.3-1.5 million, then 2 million on a given day is within the realm of possibility, basing off of the day to day fluctuations from this year and last year."

I think this number is a reasonable proxy for peak passengers screened pre-covid 19. There are two scenarios where travel statistics will return to anything resembling this peak, herd immunity or ubiquitous proliferation of a vaccine. Development of the latter is estimated to take anywhere from 1 year to 18 months.

I could not find the exact number of TSA checkpoint travel numbers for July and August, but I estimate them to be about 2.7 million. This means if there is only a 25% reduction in the number of flights due to COVID-19 that would get them past the 2 million mark. In addition, it doesn't have to consistently beat 2 million, and it fluctuates by plus or minus 200,000, so if the average per day got up to 1.8 million, there would probably be a day with more than 2 million checks, so a 33% or lower reduction in flights would probably be enough."
