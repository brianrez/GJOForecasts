The NYT reported today that the Fed Reserve isn't likely to change course because of the invasion. But invasion is likely to caused commodities prices to go much higher. Economists say the price of oil matters most because crude prices can drive up inflation and slow down the global economy. ""What happens to oil could also determine whether the Fed continues a brisk pace of hiking after it raises interest rates in March or ultimately slows the pace due to growth concerns."" So far, Pres. Biden said sanctions will not include energy sector yet. Brent oil went up over $105 today, WIT close to a hundred but both went back down after Biden spoke. This, however, I wouldn't expect to last for long. Putin is putting all on this conflict and will not stop at anything to inflict major pain if he can't get away with what he wants, or if getting what he wants is too costly, which is starting to look like it will."

Meanwhile, the labor conditions show both job creation and unemployment at levels consistent with a healing labor market. In the context of the dual mandate, a near zero policy rate is well away from neutral monetary policy, implying the need for repeated and relatively frequent increases in interest rates. The 30-day Fed Funds Futures as of Feb 11 are pricing nearly 50 basis points (bps) of rate cuts between March and June (and about 150 bps over the seven remaining meetings this year). Given the gap between current policy rates and neutral, a precipitous fall in inflation/surge in unemployment would forestall a rate hike at the May FOMC meeting. That seems unlikely given the current momentum in prices and the labor market. A pause in May could occur were the Fed to hike 50 bps in March and inflation decelerate. The May FOMC meeting will have March PCE core inflation. With the December data, that year-on-year inflation is already 4.6% and even with a halving of the current monthly rate of inflation, will be above 5% this March."

And banks are mostly estimating 5 hikes in 2022. [3] At 4 hikes my guess would be at the economic projections meetings in March, June, September, and December, but 5 makes May more likely I think. Finally this CME group tool [4] is giving a very high chance of hikes in all of March, May, and June. But if I'm understanding it correctly it gives a 0% chance of no hike in May, which to me seems implausibly low so I'm wondering if there's a weird methodology quirk and it makes me discount their information some. Overall I feel that the FED sees inflation as higher than expected but likely to ease in 2022 due to smoothing of supply chain issues, and I would think they wouldn't want to raise rates too suddenly and risk hurting markets."

In 2018 the rate rises were each quarter (and so not the May meeting) and this is the best precedent but not a particularly good one as inflation is much more concerning now.

Last week Fed doubled the rate of taper to $30 per month, implying that the tapering will be done ~March. Fed has stated that it will not raise rates until tapering is done because it would be counteracting. Current ""dot plot"" shows all 18 members expect at least 1 hike in 2022, with the vast majority expecting at least 2 hikes. Fed stopped using the word ""transitory"" for current inflation, giving cover for strong action in 2022 and 2023. Odds strongly favor multiple hikes, likely 3, starting in March or May. Initial forecast strongly favors a May hike, with lesser possibility that data forces either earlier more dramatic action or outright delay which could leave rates steady in May. Would need significant counter evidence to suggest a decrease in May 2022, so probability very low for now. Will adjust as data progresses."
