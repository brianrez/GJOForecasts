According to the U.S. census, Nevada's slightly younger, less educated, and significantly more Hispanic population all favors Sanders. Coming out of Iowa, Sanders' main rival is Pete Buttigieg (""someone else"" in this forecast), but his poor showing among Hispanic Iowans does not bode well for his chances in Nevada. Joe Biden, another potential rival to Sander's in Nevada is leading in the polls, but there has not been a new poll in almost a month. Biden did terribly in Iowa and looks to do even worse in New Hampshire. He will have no momentum and dwindling money going into Nevada.
