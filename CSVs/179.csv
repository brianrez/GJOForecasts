The conflict has flared up semi-regularly since the 1990s; as recently as this year border clashes resulted in thirty deaths (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%932022_Armenia%E2%80%93Azerbaijan_border_crisis). I think the relevant factors are a) Azerbaijan, based on its recent track record, feels it has military superiority. b) Russia's ability to keep the peace is limited by its commitments elsewhere c) Armenia's own internal political fallout from the last war is still ongoing; while I don't see revanchist Armenians attacking Azerbaijan, it seems like another reason for Azerbaijan to strike while the iron is hot. For all these reasons, I think there is a good chance of another conflict, possibly centered around Nakhchivan"

However, the recent reignition of the conflict was a very clear victory for Azerbaijan, who reconquered most of the contested territories and agreed to a peace deal granting it access to several exclaves and recuperation of occupied Az territory (not contest by Armenia juridically but nonetheless occupied since the first war). The political victory was significant for Baku, who could have interest in reigniting and terminating the war, given the current bogging down of Russian forces in Ukraine as a potential opportunity to seize further territories against its Armenian counterpart. Armenia on the other hand, has seen protesters cultivating a revanchist discourse (https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/scarred-by-war-armenian-veterans-look-warily-to-the-future/articleshow/81376857.cms?from=mdr) and could be tempted to reignite the conflict as a means to distract its population, albeit in a very isolated manner.
