The first 10 automated taxis, supplied by Cruise, the San Francisco-based self-driving car firm, majority-owned by American giant General Motors, will begin carrying paying passengers in late 2023. The aim is to gradually increase this number so that by 2030, 4,000 driverless taxis will be in operation. With their seats facing each other, the taxis can comfortably transport six people and plenty of luggage. Each vehicle is fitted with 100 sensors, soothes GM, so taxis will be able to respond safely to other drivers and stationery objects."""

On the other hand GM are burning a lot of cash with Cruise, so getting a service up and running outside the USA with a deep pocket client would bring a fair bit of wiggle room, a feather in the cap and a nice portfolio, would also go a long way to pulling a deal in Japan closer, it is all in all a major mission. It would look like trails due to start in spring next year, sort out the bugs by summer and ready to go on time by Autumn / Year End... but, this is new ground, no driver in the vehicle, so you might want to get things going a bit earlier so you can stick to your timetable, make a nice news story just before year end holidays"

I think autonomous ride-hailing services will not only open in Dubai by Jan 1st, 2023, I think this will happen well before 2023. Dubai is the ideal place for autonomous vehicles to launch and be tested because certain ""variables"" are minimal in the country. Dubai is not known for severe weather conditions such as tornadoes, hurricanes, snow fall, or torrential rain. While some companies think these conditions would be ideal for weeding out the systems of kinks, I think companies need to start in a controlled environment, like Dubai and progress to regions with more variables. The most challenging condition for equipment in Dubai would be sandstorms and if vehicles can sustain this condition, then it would most likely do well other areas. In America the ideal area for testing autonomous vehicles was/is Arizona and yet, someone died. An area that is more ideal and less likely to have a fatality would be Dubai. I think companies should start in Dubai and branch out from that region. Not only autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing but also autonomous trucking would be ideal in Dubai."

However i couldnt find any regulations formulated by the Dubai RTA for self driving yet, and there will be challenges relating to differences in weather, traffic guidelines, general differences in driving patterns etc. So testing will entail reconciling for these differences and perhaps there will be some tweaks needed to the software to account for these. The initial stage of testing will involve drivers for these vehicles, i presume its fair to say that it wont just be a case of a simple "" plug and play"" of what works in US.
