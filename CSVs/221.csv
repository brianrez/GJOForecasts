With only 23 trading days left after today, current prices at higher levels on the USDA reports, and closing prices above 950 since March 1, I'm zeroing out bin 3. I don't think the closing price on June 15 will be above 1200 right now, but prices have been so close to that today and yesterday that I think it's a real possibility. The market could continue to react slowly to the USDA news and bump prices generally higher next week. Or, the market could fall back a little and hover in bins 4 and 5. Given the slightly higher prices now, I think bin 5 is most likely at the moment."

Nice analysis of why here: https://www.barchart.com/story/news/8340366/wheats-up-double-digitsWith the price of fertilizer up, even though wheat prices are up, wheat acreage planted has fallen. Wheat needs fertilizer, but soybeans don't.The July '22 (ZWN22) price spiked to 1183.0 a little big ago, moving up 70.4 just today, but has fallen from that peak to 1170.0 so far. I can't picture prices falling below 1000 by June 15 at this point, though, even with volatility, and I think there's a bit more risk of the last bin than I thought before. (I follow July '22 CBOT wheat because the source data are W.1 CBOT wheat, which is front month wheat, i.e., the closest futures contract for CBOT wheat that can be purchased, and I think this question will be resolved using July '22 CBOT wheat data. If I'm wrong, then it'll be resolved using Sep '22 CBOT wheat data, which is very similar anyway.)https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ZWN22/overview"

July 22 futures prices (which I think is the month that will resolve this question) spiked on news of the invasion of Ukraine but have come down and stabilized at just under $1100, oscillating between bins 4 and 5. The trend in the price of wheat has been steadily upward throughout the pandemic, in large part because of changes in demand but also because of changes in input costs, including fertilizer costs. I suspect that that underlying upward trend will likely continue, but it's looking decreasingly likely to me that prices will end up over 1200. But, there are 2.5 months between now and the end of the question, and a lot can happen between now and then, so I don't rule it out. I think it's unlikely but not impossible that prices will go back to their pre-invasion range in the forecast period."

Russia will move to “weaponize” wheat supply in order to assert global influence. Russia has moved into a war time economy and more likely than not martial law will be declared shortly. In war time economies all resources are weaponized to become means to an end. If Russia is able to export its wheat to China then China would then be responsible for global distribution which would raise the price. Russia’s fertilizer industry will be hit hard by sanctions which will effect production costs for wheat. None of this news is any good news and all will contribute to record prices for wheat.

So if the situation in Ukraine does not influence prices in June than the most likely scenario seems to be bin 2, with the possibility that shortages drive prices higher into bin 3 (less wheat was produced than consumed in 2020 and 2021 - partly weather/crop yield related at least in 2021) absent export shortages (which maybe some countries have prepared for) .

That's my external view. Then, with what's happening in Ukraine now, it's reasonable to suspect production going down, and price going up. The santions against Russia may put the price up to. Nonetheless, 15th june is almost in 4 monthts. I bet the crisis will kind of stabilize because I think the attempts to keep the worldwide more or less peaceful state will be pretty big (I could be wrong). That's my inside view. So my bet for the 26th of february is that the price will go up, but not dramatically, so between 825 and 950€ seems the most likely for me.

There can obviously be huge volatility in wheat prices, so even if one forecasts the trend correctly, it's can be hard to get the price on a given day correct. Before the recent price spike, the trend price was around $800. It's currently at $862. I don't picture it being likely to go much below that. I'd suspect that the trend price might go up by ~10% if Ukraine's production is substantially affected. Add on top of that expected increases in price due to high fertilizer prices. Barring WWIII, I can't picture prices going ultra-high, but I'm leaving my options open."
