At a ""administration/distribution"" rate of currently 60% this means that only 53.5mn doses will realistically be administered by 28 February 2021, unless the administration will be more effective and swift after distribution, and the rate thus increases. Severe winter weather in the northern states could slow down all processes that I understand as part of the administration (checks on charges/quality control, analysis of supply/demand situation in counties, planning and delivery to the actual vaccination site) for the next two weeks, and cancelled appointments due to road conditions could counter and nil the effect of increased distribution entirely. Even under a very optimistic assumption that the figures Number of ""People Receiving 1 or More Doses"" and ""Total Doses Administered"" will approach 66% in the medium term according to the share of one-shot-regimen vaccines and two-shot-regimen vaccines with first doses growing faster than second doses (thus, the respective rate People Receiving 1 or More Doses/Total Doses Administered could approach ca. 80% at maximum when second doses are entirely neglected), there is still the number of people receiving their second dose only, which will not add to the total under scrutiny, and with hindsight to the fact that all vaccines currently administered - BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna - are currently two-doses-regimens unless the CDC changes its strategy for a first-shots-first strategy, second doses (currently at a rate of 400k on average a day) could subtract as many as 8mn doses from the maximum possible, which leaves us at 46mn or even less. A ten per cent increase of people vaccinated versus initial projection would be a giant step, but however desirable and welcome it will be, it will be hard to achieve. The initiative to source pharmacies and even WalMart as vaccination sites could in the medium term have such an effect, but beginning on 11 February only and on a limited scale, the impact on the outcome of this question will be minor. An estimate is between 47 and 49mn, due to unexpected effects in the distribution chain that I'm unaware of, and a possibly varying lag time of reporting and accuracy. If the involvement of pharmacies after 11 February 2021 changes the ""administration/distribution"" rate significantly, perhaps to 65% to70% due to less complex distribution, existing and established distribution routes, the outcome will look much differently. This effect will be seen from the data no sooner than 15 February 2021, and the maximum possible figure could reach up to 56mn, with the currently available two vaccines. Only with unconstrained fresh supply confirmed by producers, the stored capacity (Total Doses Delivered minus Total Doses Administered) will converge towards zero, since the necessary storage quota [""stored capacity""/(Number of People Receiving 1 or More Doses minus Number of People Receiving 2 Doses)], currently around 80%, can sink below 50%. https://us.cnn.com/2021/02/04/us/covid-19-vaccine-drug-stores/index.html"
