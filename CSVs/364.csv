However, the anomaly calculated over the longer timeframe we have now (May-late July) is now much less than -1C. This is largely because of warmer-than-average days in late June, but for what it's worth, I've also noticed some upward revision of the early June temperature data as reported now vs my download at the time of my last ""check-in"". On average, we've seen daily temps -0.43C lower than the corresponding daily averages calculated over the 2014-2021 timeframe. For reference, the May-September average across these years (8 years x 153 days each) was ~35.49C, and if the second half of our time period maintains a statistical temperature anomaly similar to what we've seen so far, then we're basically on track for a mid-bin #2 outcome. We'd need to see an average going-forward temperature anomaly > +0.5C vs previous years to have any chance of bin #3. Climate model forecasts continue to suggest that this is much less likely than not to actually happen. Presumably, as forecasting time windows get shorter, these predictions should become increasingly accurate as well."

However, they are also the cloudiest months of the year. Increases in temperature that have been trending in recent years may disrupt the upward trend from year to year. Forecasting cloud cover over 6 months from now is dubious, so it may only decrease the likelihood of a significant jump in average temps. Given the few years that I initially looked at, the trend is minimal but appears to be above 35.5. Revisiting this question to look at other time periods will help refine forecasting percentages."
