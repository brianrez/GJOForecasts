Lastly CNN states that North Korea has been preparing previously shut down nuclear testing sites.

This can be assumed to some degree of certainty to be a cover-up for the time as North Korea this year has now yet again fired ICBMs. Recent developments concerning China and The United States show concern for North Korea proceeding to test again soon.

I don't put it above North Korea to detonate low grade nuclear weapon missiles over Japan. Enough to promote low-grade sickness, but not to kill, with higher rates of long-term problems, towards a country that already has nuclear contamination. Weakening Japan has too many advantages for its competing adversaries, has already been the subject of environmental contamination and is strategically tempting as a chip among its adversaries to make a bold statement with. The timing is right, considering Russia's needs where Ukraine is concerned, China's tension with the United States regarding Taiwan and other matters, and North Korea's politics. I believe that if they did detonate a low-grade nuclear device over Japan, Japan would handle it like they did Fukushima and publicly knowledge of it would be suppressed. Given North Korea's history, I believe it is highly likely that North Korea will detonate a nuclear device soon, so that the world has no choice but to acknowledge it. They will do so for leverage and brinkmanship. North Korea's detonation of a nuclear weapon is contingent on concession making on the part of the west and western affiliates and allies. However, concessions are not necessarily a good idea. The losses in the long run for short term gain where concessions are made is too problematic. China has the most promise, where talks take place, with the right skill and savvy. However, I'm not certain anyone has this to offer, to date. I place my estimate at 50/50 because I believe North Korea will detonate a nuclear weapon by the end of spring 2023, but I am less certain they will do it by November 30, 2022, based on current trajectories."

This is very difficult to make an assessment so I have forecast in the middle for now and if the US intelligence changes, or as time passes I will reduce the likelihood."

KJU may try to bargain away the nuclear test for relief aid, or he may perform the test and haggle afterward. There are a lot of potential storylines swirling here, but one that I find convincing is that, having tested ballistics missiles, KJU will want to prove efficacy of nuclear warheads to show that NK is has capable nuclear ballistic missiles. US intel community experts are publicly claiming an expected test by the end of the month - if this nuclear test does not occur by 6/1, I'll have to revise the probability downwards."

NK recently tested a hypersonic missile in January along with a more recent flight test this month. There is some dispute among analysts in various ICs about whether the Kwasong 15 used in a military display in March is real; this ICBM has been designed and is in development. It has not been flight tested and is a likely candidate for the next series of tests. North Korea has recently reopened the Tongbyon nuclear reactor in March of this year, continuing plutonium separation and uranium enrichment activities. These activities likely supports its current military and political strategy (more below). NK holds an advantage in its asymmetric military balance with South Korea. On April 26, Kim made a series of statements which has been assessed by the ICs that indicates a significant shift in its nuclear ambitions and strategy. Major powers find this worrying to say the least. The Kwasong-17 flight tested in March but prematurely exploded according to SK IC. Kim’s statements indicate an increased likelihood of using nuclear weapons to resolve various crises (domestically, an internal regime crisis within its military apparatus and threats of regime change - the latter possible but highly unlikely to occur). US IC assesses that these recent nuclear tests indicate Kim’s need to demonstrate advanced military capabilities, use for blackmail diplomacy and to raise threats in order to receive potential economic and political concessions from its adversaries. It also tests strategic and tactical weapons to boost the morale of its military where serious grievances exist along with severe food shortages within its ranks."
