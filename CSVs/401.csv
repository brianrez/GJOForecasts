They did not release specific figures but based on August and July sales and inventory totals released we estimate that current YTD production is 1.275M units. Using mean monthly averages we arrive at an expected production total of 1.9M units. We feel the most likely scenario is 1.75 - 2M. We feel the second most likely scenario is that the Ford exceeds these values slightly on the high end. One of the events which exacerbated supply shortage was the February freeze in Texas where numerous large scale semiconductor companies have operations. As these events move further in the past the supply chain, while still crimped will not be as crimped. The order book is strong enough for Ford to continue producing. The 3rd most likely event is a significant miss of numbers as a result of supply chain shortages. We find any high beats to be unlikely."
