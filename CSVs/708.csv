Mr Abe is stepping down after almost eight years in office, because of ill health. Their platforms are not vastly different. Suga Yoshihide, Mr Abe’s 71-year-old loyal chief cabinet secretary, Ishiba Shigeru, 63, a hawkish ex-minister of defence and agriculture (and Mr Abe’s sole competitor in the 2018 election to be party leader), and Kishida Fumio, also 63, a liberal former foreign minister who is now the LDP’s policy chief, all want to change Japan’s constitution, ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific region and revitalise rural areas. The debates will not change much. Only 141 of the 535 votes come from rank-and-file party members. Mr Suga has already secured the backing of five of the LDP’s seven factions, which will cast the other 394.“"

It is also clear that the only three left in the contest at this stage are Ishiba, Kishida and Suga. However, Ishiba and Kishida's popularity, both amongst public and the all important factions within the LDP are insufficient to carry them to the leadership position. Ishiba's plan to use Nintendo's Animal Crossing game to garner public suport (https://bit.ly/2ZfcBoj) has been abandoned for fear of contravening the games terms of use. Thus Suga appears the frontrunner. Hence my above revised forecast leaving a small margin for Ishiba and Kishida in the unlikely event some misfortune befalls Suga."

It is worth noting that Abe has been president of the LDP for an incredibly long time - almost 8 years when compared to the 2-3 years average time in office, so the internal geometries might have shifted since the last election. Anyway, presuming nothing changed, Shigeru Ishiba has been the strongest opponent in 2012 and 2018, even though his extreme positions (he is affiliated to the openly nationalist organization Nippon-Kaigi and the attempted formation of an opposing faction within the LDP) might encourage the rest of the party to join forces to promote a single opponent. Among the options, Taro Aso is maybe too old to take office, so Fumio Kishida or Taro Kono might have a stronger chance. Yoshihide Suga might be a wild card as he has been a close ally of Abe and has pushed for economic instead of constitutional reforms (typically art. 9, about the prohibition of reforming a Japanese army), but openly denied interest in the position, which lowers expectations. Finally Toshimitsu Motegi - not listed - is unlikely to win, because of recent scandals (possible breach of Japan's electoral laws in 2018). This brings me to express a significant advantage for Kishida."
