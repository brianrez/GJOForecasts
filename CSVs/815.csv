Since this is the question I was most invested in forecasting recently, I'm doing a quick hindsight examination of my rationales. Broadly: pretty good, but also somewhat lucky. I think all five underlying conditions I posited here (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1060600) seem to have been correct, as was the use of slower-but-longer-growth version of first wave NY as my main comparison point. Working from those assumptions, the growth curve was fairly predictable, and my updates (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1064318) seem to have been pretty much on point. Where does the luck come in? If we'd been asked to forecast deaths instead of hospitalizations, I think I would have posited the same underlying conditions and then been very wrong in my forecasts (similarly to how I just can't seem to get a handle on how the data is moving in the AZ ICU question). I'm proud of the reads I made on this question, but I also think the data ""played nice"" here to an unusual extent, and there are many similar questions I would have been much less accurate on."

The underlying conditions I posited in that post seem to be borne out strongly in the data, and I don't quite understand how people are reading recent trends as optimistically as the crowd forecast indicates. Cases and hospitalizations continue to rise at an extremely rapid rate that's only becoming more rapid. It will be at least a week until substantial changes in public policy and/or personal behavior, and it will be weeks after that until those changes are reflected in the hospitalization data. Even then, it will be some time before the curve reverses, rather than just slowing. Texas population size means the ceiling on hospitalizations is frighteningly high. I keep coming back to the fact that NY has 2/3 the population and far more effective mitigation/containment measures, and still peaked at 18k hospitalizations."

A simple extrapolation shows hospitalizations growing to over 10,000 by mid-July. Given that Texas is implementing no new mitigation as of June 22, other than some local regulations on masks, it is unlikely that the rate of growth will slow materially over the next few weeks. In New York, we saw hospitalizations go from ~6,000 when their lockdown started in late March to the peak at >16,000 on April 13. Texas is on a similar trajectory. Therefore, I think it is highly likely that Texas will be over 10,000. I would put a meaningful probability on the number being >15,000."

This was when there were ~10,000 new cases per day. At this point, there are ~2,000 new cases per day in Texas. This shows that (AT THIS POINT), there’s ~20% of the cases in Texas but only ~10% of the hospitalizations NY experienced. Assuming a change in hospitalizations of ~10%, (the rate in NY as stated above), this implies an increase of ~200 beds each day while at this level. The existing hospitalizations are 2,166 as of June 12 and have increased by ~22% from 1,773 on June 2nd. Assuming the rate of increase in cases is constant instead of exponential for simplicity purposes, 200 new hospitalizations (technically the change in hospitalizations) would be 22% higher every 10 days, or eventually reaching ~975 by the end of August. Assuming all else remains constant, the month of August alone would have significantly more than 10,000 total hospitalizations. That said, there are obviously a multitude of other factors, including the rate at which people are released, changes in policy restricting activities, personal adherence to policies or recommendations, etc. Due to the liberty Texas has and the resistance it would likely face reimplementing any lock downs, I believe Taxes will wait as long as possible to act which will therefore allow the coronavirus to spread substantially. So, I believe the number of total hospitalizations will be more than 10,000 at some point prior to August 31st."
