Around August, harvesting in higher elevation areas is expected to improve outcomes to Stressed (IPC Phase 2).

I looked through FEWSNET's analysis of food security in Afghanistan which was updated in October 2021, and which therefore took into account the increase in displaced people in September 2021. FEWSNET had classified about 3/4 of Afghan counties as Level 3 (food crisis) and 1/4 at Level 4 (food emergency.) It isn't inevitable that counties in Level 4 will degrade to famine (Level 5) but it seemed to me at least as likely as not that at least some will: given that the Level 4 classification means that families are taking drastic steps e.g. eating up the cereals they would normally stock for the lean season (Jan-May according to FEWSNET.) I've reduced the risk from this base case because (a) large ($1bn +) humanitarian aid pledges from the EU and other countries since October 2021 should keep food aid flowing into Afghanistan, and (b) recent talks in Oslo where it was agreed that the Taliban will gain some access to $280m of Afghanistan's frozen reserve funding, of which some might be spent on food imports."
