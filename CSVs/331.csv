In lieu of an all-out war, there wouldn't really be any reason for China to send their aircraft that close to Taiwan as merely crossing into the Taiwanese ADIZ will get the world media's attention. ADIZs are not enforced by international law, so it's much lower risk for China. The primary purposes of these operations are: 1.) Intimidation (sending a political message), 2.) Chinese pilots get more experience, 3.) Forcing the smaller Taiwanese air force to wear itself out more. None of these requires flying inside Taiwan's territorial boundaries, and doing so would jeopardize foreign trade agreements such as the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment with the EU (see other GJ question). Looking at maps of some previous incursions into the ADIZ, I found nothing that indicates the Chinese sent aircraft anywhere close to the 12-mile mark (see example Chinese incursion-https://supchina.com/2021/10/05/taiwan-adiz-incursions-explaining-chinas-surge-in-warplane-activity-in-the-taiwanese-air-defense-zone/)."

This way Chinese fleet is protected by its own naval aviation and air assets on the mainland. • Finally Chinese subs do cross the median line and take up positions on the northern and southern sides and at least a couple punch through into open waters to take a position in international waters but near Japan, Guam, and the Philippine Sea. Additionally, Chinese air and naval assets in the south China sea go on full alert and start surprise exercises. The dilemma in the above scenario is how will Taiwan, US, and its allies respond. Since the start of the current crises US and allied countries moves have been reactionary than proactive. Consider this Midterm election fever is in full swing so US response will definitely be reactionary than proactive, but what will be the response, China has only announced a blockade of Taiwan straits, but its naval and air assets have stayed on its side of the median line and not violated Taiwan side of the median line or its airspace. Additionally Chinese start a convoy of civilian supply ships to Kinmen and Matsu islands so they don’t run out of food, energy, and medical supplies. Again China has created a provocative move but stayed on its side of the median line, below are options before Taiwan and US • Option 1 Taiwan challenges the blockade and tries to sail civilian supply ships to Kinmen and Matsu. China responded by seizing these civilian vessels as soon as they cross their side of the median line, if these supply ships are provided armed escort, then China tries to seize those ships as well but only once they cross the median line and, in this instance, China goes one step further and moves its naval assets engaged in blockade beyond the median line and closer to Taiwan and starts patrolling Taiwanese airspace but does not attack Taiwan outright • Option 2 US and allied nations try to arrange a freedom of navigation convoy to challenge the blockade, this will take too much time to organize and once again many nations refuse to take part as again the median line has not been crossed, China responds by closing entire south China sea off-limits to countries other than the ones located in South China seas and also seizing Paratas Islands. This will be difficult for China, but its intimidation tactics may work, and other countries may refuse to join the US lead convoy and refuse permission to traverse their own territorial waters. China ups the ante by moving beyond the median line and patrolling Taiwan airspace but not attacking Taiwan • Option 3 Taiwan sees writing on the wall, it concludes that the US is busy with elections and is fumbling in its response, so it first decides to execute option 1 and then once China responds Taiwan starts a limited armed response to try and break the blockade forcing the US to either come to its defense or forever be cast aside as declining power."

(2) It would be worrying if China starts testing these zones but the change would also be a lot smaller in the short term. especially entering the 12 miles and triggering the destruction of an aircraft wouldn't seem logical at this point, also taking into account the demand for action from the Chinese people at such a point and the escalation into full scale war that could follow.

China will likely have the capability to support an invasion of Taiwan within 5 years. China will incrementally increase provocations from (current) ADIZ incursions to territorial waters incursions. Taiwan will draw a 'line in the sand' at China's territorial waters incursion. China will cross Taiwan's territorial waters by 10/1/22. Taiwan will publicly condemn China for said territorial incursions.
