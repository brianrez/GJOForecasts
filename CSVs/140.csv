Their numbers seem to be always a bit larger than the CDC numbers - comparing yesterday's numbers, the CDC's number was ~93% of the BNN/Medriva number. This translates into approximately ""more than 185.7k"" cases for today in the CDC data. Last Wednesday, there were 145.8k cases, for a difference of ~40k. This can be expected to increase the 7-day average by ~40k/7 = 5.7k. Currently, the 7-day average is 104.4k, so it's reasonable to think the 7-day average in the CDC data for May 25, as shown tomorrow, will be >= ~110.1k. That would leave 2 days to increase the 7-day average by an additional 10k/day. The total for last Thursday and Friday was 263k, so this total would need to be around 263k + 70k = 333k. If tomorrow and Friday end up with numbers similar to today's (average ~166k), this would be possible. The crowd has moved from 97% to 21% over the past couple days; I think I'll give it a slightly higher chance of yes."

This is assuming the percentage increase in 7-day average of daily cases is not increasing. I think given BA.2 appears to produce relatively mild infection, a far smaller fraction of people will be symptomatic enough for testing compared to the delta surge in August 2021 (peak 7-day average 165,187). On the other hand, given the recent lifting of mask mandates throughout the country, ""COVID-fatigue"" and a desire to return to normalcy it's possible that rates accelerate, and only a small acceleration is necessary to reach the 120k daily cases. The peak may be close to 120k and hopefully the next few days/coming week makes things clearer."
