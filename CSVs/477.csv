The infrastructure deal announced yesterday may help a bit, but the increase in COVID cases and the soon to be announced vaccine mandate for federal workers could hurt him somewhat. Additionally, immigration is still a huge risk for Biden. Lastly, progressives are starting to get impatient for his American Families Plan and student debt cancellation (if or when it happens)."

But after about a year his weakness showed through and he became very unpopular. Same thing will happen to Creepy Joe, but I think much worse."

The This increased stability could make for a more stable future forecast, especially as the forcasting timeline is only 3ish weeks outs. However, Biden's 538 approval rating rides much closer to the 50% boundary (currently 52%) than most previous presidential candidate, meaning that even a relatively minor negative event could tip him into the below 50% category. Moreover, the 538 approval has a negative drift, which increases the odds further. Without an explicit model, it is hard to factor come up with reliable estimates."

Which means, probably won't go below 50% or above 55%, at least through August. Of course, there could be some major event, but hard to say whether, for example, war in the Middle East between Israel and some combination of Arab states/Palestinians would send his rating up or down, or affect it at all."
