While the Yankees have played 27 games, LeMahieu has only had 73 at bats, putting him below the 3.1 plate appearances per team game requirement. If he does not bat more than he will not meet the requirement, if he does then his average will almost definitely fall. If the season reaches its projected 60 games, he will need 113 more bats, or 3.42 at bats each game. This is doable but with such a quick succession of games it will be difficult to make every plate appearance remaining count. Blackmon has 107 at bats, putting him well above the threshold of 3.1 plate appearances per team game thus far, but his average has taken a hit (no pun intended) in recent weeks. Long story short, unless the season ends tomorrow, I'm sticking with my original prediction which is turning into more and more conservative an estimate every week."

With this, we can calculate the odds that all 877 (or thereabouts) players in the MLB miss this mark to be 99.97%. That assumes a full season and a normalized distribution of batting prowess, which are large assumptions given the current landscape. However, even if we assume current conditions make it 100% more likely for a player to reach this threshold, that gives a 3% possibility one player does it and a 0.09% chance two do. This is an extreme assumption, but is relatively reflective of the current state of things across the league.

Most of this probability rests with Charlie Blackmon. He's hitting .500. The ZiPS projection system figures he's a .337 hitter in the long run. Assuming he has about 150 AB left in his season (playing about 40 more games), and attaching a rough distribution around the point estate of his true talent, I think he has about a 20.5% chance. Applying the same to Donovan Solano and DJ Lemahieu (both ~.310 hitters), I get a 1% chance and a 0.4% chance, respectively. Daniel Murphy, Kyle Lewis, and Starling Matter, all worse hitters for average who would also need to hit >.400 the rest of the way, clock in around 0.1%. I'll add 0.5% for the field. That all adds up to about 23%. The odds of more than one guy doing it are less than 1%. I also have to account for the probability that one of these teams plays far less than their remaining 40ish games due to COVID. Over about 30 games, their odds increase about 50%. If there's a 15% chance that a given team gets hit and misses an average of 10 games, Blackmon's odds in particular increase by about 3%.
