Note that quarterly GDP is always based on the change in GDP from the prior quarter (i.e. Q3). ""Annualized"" means you take a quarterly figure and annualize it (1+ r/100)^4. However, reading the question description, it seems to refer to annual (not annualized) growth (i.e. ending GDPQ4'15/ending GDPQ4'14 - 1) or year over year growth. If that is what is desired, a much clearer way to phrase the question would be how many of the countries would show positive YoY real GDP growth at the end of Q4 2015 or even more simply, show positive GDP growth for the full year 2015. There is almost no way for either Brazil or Russia to have positive GDP growth for the full year 2015."

Russia's oil and gas revenues have collapsed, military expenditures have gone up. Current account and fiscal balances adjust slowly. Besides, they face corruption scandals and sanctions as the cherry on top. However, there is some chance that one of them (probably Russia) posts mildly positive growth. First, reporting is a bit muddy; they can report positive as an national accounting wonder.

Russia is highly likely not to (-4.1% GDP in Q3'15), similar to Brazil (-4.4% in Q3'15). This divergence is significant. The likelihood that either India or China will report a negative number is very close to zero, while the likleihood of a positive number from either of Russia or Brazil is similarly very low. Moreover, we are almost at the end of Q4 already. It is almost inconceivable at this point for somethign so dramatically negative to happen in China and India as to drag the average Q4 growth rate to negative - even earthquakes of significant proportions, wars and terrorism all combined might not take the overall growth rate to negative given that the majority of the quarter now has already been positive. The same is true in terms of a positive event of similar magnitude in Russia or Brazil - even oil going to $200 might not drag up Russia's Q4 GDP to positive levels - even if Q1'16 would then certainly be at that level in this scenario. I am very confident that the number is 2 positive growth levels in GDP for BRIC countries in Q4'15."

While it seems unlikely, Russia or Brazil *might* have some low probability of joining China and India with a positive Q4 , it is unlikely. All four being Q4 positive is very unlikely, but never a zero probability.
