This volume decline came against the backdrop of political unrest that shows few signs of being resolved. Indeed, uncertainties over Brexit, the policies of the Trump administration, and the lead-up to elections in France and Germany have provided dealmakers with reason to pause. However, while deal volume is down, we are seeing an increase in megadeals and high- value acquisitions as dealmakers proceed with caution and are more selective over the transactions they choose to pursue."""
