Toyota seem to be ahead of the pack possibly due its policy of developing a solid-state battery in-house whereas all the other major car manufacturers having entered joint ventures with battery producers. Toyota’s advantage being that it is control of its own engineering processes and budgetary concerns. The question does specify the debut of a model rather than an on-road offer. Car Manufacturers seemingly in place to debut cars are: Toyota Ford BMW NIO VW(?)

General Motors in a development with SES (Singapore) is aiming to produce such a battery in 2023. Volkswagen in conjunction with QuantumScape of California suggest 2025. Tesla has issued no plans. A solid-state battery dispenses with a liquid or gel but allows the lithium to pass through. This allows for a smaller, lighter unit with more energy. Toyota is designing its battery in-house to be on the market in the early 2020’s. The question, one assumes to a vehicle commercially available rather than a concept type. The likelihood of such of a vehicle appearing prior to January 1st 2023 seems presumptuous."

Solid state battery tech isn't likely to achieve commercial viability at any level in the vehicle space certainly in the first half of this decade but probably not even in the second half. I allow for a fat tail chance that QS can put their batteries in some vehicle in the next two years but think that it is both very unlikely and almost certainly in a prototype model or an extremely small number of vehicles for economic and manufacturing reasons.

Recent developments out of Quantumscape (massively funded by VW) show the promise, but they have not translated that into mass production yet. That step must be met before any trials on cars with solid state cells. The trials must precede any sales. But these debuts do not require such stringent conditions. The question leaves open what must be debuted. Does the car need to move? Would it need to actually have the cells and a usable cockpit and not be some empty shell? I presume yes. Furthermore, the vast majority of solid state cells are pouch cells whereas most of the EVs are using the cylindrical 18650s. The size differences will mean that the structural changes to a vehicle will not be trivial. A whole new chassis may be required with the passengers being moved up ~5 cm. This shouldn't be too difficult for a show vehicle. For all the excitement around solid state, to debut a car like this a company will most likely already be manufacturing (or partnering on that) already. That limits the number of companies down to maybe 5/6. I'm lacking knowledge of just how adventurous a manufacturer would be on a debut. Also, how interesting would this be at a car show? To what extent is an EV just an EV to the viewers?"

The iPhone maker's automotive efforts, known as Project Titan, have proceeded unevenly since 2014 when it first started to design its own vehicle from scratch. At one point, Apple drew back the effort to focus on software and reassessed its goals. Since then, Apple has progressed enough that it now aims to build a vehicle for consumers, two people familiar with the effort said"
