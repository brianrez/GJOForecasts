Given J and J political power and Merck We have alliance with Bundesrepublik of Germany two of the biggest drug manufacturers in the world are doing our bidding At a nice profit to shareholders. this may be the capitalist corrupt result given the interest dominated system in the United States.

So in a short run we will have enough shots and arms the United States But not enough to win the war globally FDR would have been disappointed. FDR and Hopkins and Marshall are rolling their eyes in heaven. They would have stressed the importance of defeating Hitler and amf vaccimation away from our shores. And Homeland too . FDR required all manufacturers to produce like he shut down the auto industry and War Production Board produce tanks and airplanes Ford GM and Chrysler and American motors.

The EUA process from filing an application to approval by the FDA took 18 days for Moderna and 22 days for Pfizer, and J&J. AstraZeneca and Novovax are the next two most likely companies to seek an EUA from the FDA. The AstaZeneca vaccine has received approval from several other countries and is being widely administered in Europe, Mexico, India, Argentina, and several other countries. However, AstraZeneca has faced problems with its data related to the efficaciousness in the elderly population and their mistakes in dosing their trials. As a result, AstraZeneca will likely have to wait to conclude US phase 3 trials which will take a few more weeks. Novovax's vaccine results from Britain look excellent. Novovax will likely seek British approval in the next few weeks based on these trials conducted there. Then, Novovax is expected to apply for US approval in the 2nd quarter of 2021 based on the British trial data (if FDA will accept it), or it will wait on US phase 3 trials to complete, which could take 2-3 more months. It is unlikely that AstraZeneca or Novovax will receive EUA approval before 3/31/21 as that would require filing an EUA application no later than March 13, 2021, based on recent precedent. With that said, as variants continue to spread and the decline in positive cases and hospitalizations stalls in the U.S., it is possible that a 4th vaccine could receive an EUA in the next 29 days."

Even though Novavax completed the enrollment in record time, Johnson & Johnson took about 1.5 months from announcing completing its trial enrollment to releasing it phase 3 trial data, and about another 3 weeks until the FDA would meet to consider its data (http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/j_and_j_completes_enrolment_for_late-stage_covid-19_vaccine_trial_1360239, https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-single-shot-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-met-primary-endpoints-in-interim-analysis-of-its-phase-3-ensemble-trial).

This would put Novavax at the end of March for releasing the stage 3 trial data, with some additional time needed for the FDA to consider it (although probably less than the other 3 because Novavax is already under the rolling review process (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/novavax-s-covid-vaccine-begins-rolling-review-process-in-u-s)).

Why I am still at 10% for 4: I have been dumping on AZ because of its quirky trial data reported in Nov and lack of effectiveness for over 65. So EUA cost benefit may not materialize. So perhaps the FDA makes a political decision to EUA AZ to administer to those under 65. When Trump was president there was a fear that he would pressure the FDA to approve an unsafe vaccine. So all eyes were on the FDA process. But now that Dr. Biden is President (joe not jill) we all blindly trust that political pressure would never ever influence a scientific decision. (On the anniversary of Challenger disaster I am reminded that science rarely trumps a bad visual, like delaying a launch, or having to answer a tough question like exactly why couldn't you have approved AZ a few weks sooner and save some lives.). Very possible if vaccine doses do not start showing up from pfizer, moderna, and J&J, the FDA just pushes the AZ through. Strongly arguing against this is Fauci has said AZ is no better than pfizer and moderna (criteria for EUA is must provide a value add) whereas J&J is a single shot with more forgiving storage temperature. Of course it would not be so hard to argue thag AZ value add is being available to allow a more rapid vaccination process."

I'm quite confident on J&J getting approved, but I added 5 to the 2 bucket on the chance that they aren't approved. Astrazeneca still seems unlikely to get approved in the time period, but if J&J and Novavax were to both fail or be delayed it seems possible that more pressure would be put on the FDA to approve Astrazeneca before the completion of their US trial."

Additionally, raps.org (https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles/2020/3/covid-19-vaccine-tracker) is reporting only two ""approved"" vaccines, both stemming from Moscow, whoever neither of which has entered phase three clinical trials, which raises much concern about its safety and long term effectiveness. I believe its unlikely the U.S. would approve a vaccine stemming from Moscow without adequate phase three testing. While the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) is working with more than 18 biopharmaceutical companies to rapidly develop and test COVID-19 vaccines, the FDA is not willing to rush a vaccine without understanding its side effects and overall effectiveness. Timelines as full clinical trials make it hard for vaccines to be approved by the FDA, then that timeline can be compounded by manufacturing and delivery on a massive scale needed to make a vaccine available to the public. Granted the question is specific to emergency use, so that may increase the chances of its use."
