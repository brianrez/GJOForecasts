The FDA’s decision has been hailed as the first approval for a gene therapy in the US. Some argue that this isn’t a true gene therapy, as the genes introduced into the T-cells are not the treatment themselves – it is the transformed T-cells that go on to fight the cancer. But the FDA defines human gene therapy as products that introduce genetic material into a person’s DNA to treat a disease, so has classified Kymriah as such. https://www.newscientist.com/article/2146048-pioneering-gene-therapy-approved-for-leukaemia-in-the-us/ @Anneinak @acohen"

Although it is on the right track for the approval- it has gained breakthrough designation and has also been assigned as an orphan drug (these should have lowered some statistical burdens/requirements), it has successfully completed the phase 3 of trials which have shown positive results- there are still many hurdles to cross . The company is still in the process of submitting the BLA. According to the website- ""We anticipate completing the Biologics Licensing Application (BLA) submission to the U.S. FDA in early 2017."" This is an important sentence to keep in mind while considering the date mentioned in the above question. After the application is submitted, the FDA has a 60 day filling period after which it acts on 90% of the applications by 10 months max. For priority drugs it has to make a call in 6 months max. So, the maximum range for approval is around 8 to 12 months. If the BLA is submitted in January and if there are no problems with the application, then the treatment could get approved by September or next year. But this depends on when the application is formally submitted. The website gives no indication regarding this. Further, gene therapy isn't like any other drug. It's new and therefore, high amount of scrutiny before approval is expected.These could eventually lead to delays. As, for other other factors that might affect it's approval, I don't think Trump will be one. In my opinion, his anti-establishment rhetoric will only expedite the approval process if nothing. These are his words as quoted in an article -""Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA; there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications."" So, in totality, I think, because the FDA is slow, the possibility that gene therapy treatment will be approved before October 1st is quite tiny."
