This would suggest that the international border is not likely to open anytime soon. But there is much talk of the economic need for tourism and international students, which would apply pressure to open the border sooner rather than later. It seems logical the government will opt for a staged re-opening of the border through the second half of 2020, after July. This leaves a maximum of 5 months, which at H2 2020 rates would equate to 24m passengers. However, it is also likely that a significant proportion of cancelled H1 trips (business and tourism) may be taken in the second half of the year. With all these considerations in mind, the likely figure will almost certainly be less than 24m. The question is: by how much? And the will depend most heavily on the government's schedule for re-opening the border. Given that the biggest factor influencing that decision is the progress of COVID worldwide, and that that doesn't look like slowing down anytime soon, I have wagered that the border will be opened slowly and selectively, which favours the lower figure."

Qantas Airways Limited has demonstrated growth in passengers carried, seats available, and revenue from 2014 to 2019. This includes carrying 48,776,000 passengers in 2014; 52,681,000 in 2016; and 55,273,000 in 2018 according to tables in the 2018 Annual Report. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has halted significant portions of air travel. Two trends used to forecast the impact this will have on the total passengers carried in the second half of the year include Australia's recovery from COVID-19 and Qantas' domestic flights. Approximately four months passed in China from the first cases until a day without new cases and it continues to see less than 100 to 200 new cases per day. Like other countries, China has restricted international travel. As a result it is likely that Australia will see major recovery by July, although international travel limits may remain in place. Qantas has suspended nearly all international flights and cut domestic capacity by 60% to deal with the current drop in demand for flights. On the other hand, Qantas is financially stable, has a broad domestic network, and expects to see pent up demand after COVID-19. Domestic flights alone may bring Qantas 12 to 13 million passengers at 80% of domestic capacity because Qantas carried over 32 million passengers on domestic flights in 2019."

Qantas displayed 2 solid years, without much change, and there is not much reason for crazy change in the supply of Qantas. The government provided a solid package of about $A 1 billion to airlines, which focused on the big airlines such as Qantas and therefore I feel that despite the cuts and change to operations they had to make, the airline will not be significantly weakened in the short run. Now for the demand side. Most articles I have read have given a timeline of roughly 4-7 months for demand to increase again. This is much more global and severe than SARS which took a bit less time than this for demand of tourism to recover in Asia. An important factor is that Qantas is focused on international air, which means that it will be badly hit in demand. However, its data books show that roughly 40% of its flights are to and from Asia, which has recovered much more quickly and effectively from the virus. This suggests that this portion of passengers will not change much. However for its flights elsewhere, it will take a siginficant amount of time for demand to recover."
