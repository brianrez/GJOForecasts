Extrapolated out to 2/28 this equates to a max of 20.83 Lira/Euro. However, looking back, in May of 2022 the Lira to Euro rate did increase dramatically from 15.66 to 17.52, so a large one-month jump is not out of the question, but seems unlikely given recent inflation data suggesting a downward trend. The political climate in Turkey remains volatile, especially given a potential early election in May, however I'm not sure this should markedly affect the Lira price in February. Senior officials in Turkey also say a vote for Sweden and Finland's accession into NATO would likely not occur until after domestic elections, so this should also alleviate the chance of a 22.000 Lira/Euro by Feb. 28."
