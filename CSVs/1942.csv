This movie feeeds off of the Avengers success story. Batman vs. Superman did not feed of off anything great before it. Superman-movies have not produced a successful sequel since the 80's and Batman had big shoes to fill after switching from Nolan as a director and Bale as Batman, towards the new cast. They failed miserably and the first viewer's and critique's reaction are a big factor in the early success of a film, since many people decide what to watch, on the day, rather than beforehand."

The last Cap'n America movie only made $90M in its opening weekend, but it was released in April, and it didn't include the rest of the Avengers. I assume Marvel moved the release date to May specifically to bring in more money for the opening and because this is essentially an Avengers movie."

Besides the fact that Batman v Superman was a tired pony from the start of the race as far as movie drum-up i.e., a lame opening weekend ticket gross domestically in the United States, Marvel just has bigger plans than the boys across the aisle. Marvel's film will exceed DC's opening weekend gross and it's thanks to the lads in the writer's room. This film has a very mediated tone potentially leading in many directions. Bucky Barnes, who is being pursued for his brain-washed actions in Captain America: Winter Soldier, takes on a number of Avengers, including Iron Man and Black Widow. This is a turning-point scene, as Bucky unloads a bullet from point-blank range at Tony Stark (Iron Man). This is a clear warning to the playboy genius that it's now a blood sport and there is no turning back. This scene is revealing a very provocative storyline future to come and if the whole film is on this level it will exceed well over $166,007,347 domestic which was the total gross for Batman v Superman in it's opening weekend. Furthermore, the DC Comic film's domestic gross was only 37.5% of its total lifetime gross. I cannot wait to see what this sequence throws into motion. One year after the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, another incident occurs involving the Avengers resulting in collateral damage, enticing politicians to voice the need for closer management of such beings. And form a system of accountability and a governing body to determine when the Avengers are needed. When Steve Rogers (Captain America) attempts to protect Barnes and ends up in a conflict with Stark. The Avengers divide into two opposing leagues—one led by Captain America, who wishes to operate without convoluting regulation, and the other by Iron Man, who can sees value in government sovereignty over the team. This film becomes quite poetic once you begin to sense the euphemism for modern American political differences beneath the storyline's suggestive current. Captain America portraying the conservative struggle for a free and wholesome life and Iron Man resembling the liberal willingness to submit to government protection and equal benefit for all. This theme seems to paint the walls and canvases of Marvel's ""Civil War"" empire. Marvel stands to make a king's ransom from this picture domestically and abroad, a film of controversy and depth."

(I skipped it.) So I am guided in my prediction by my oldest sons, who streamed ""Superman"" and liked it much better on the second viewing, then contributed to the above-mentioned $166M-- matinee showing, no concessions. They have already offered to take their younger brothers to see ""Civil War"" on opening weekend. They have not asked me to pay for any of the tickets, nor to provide concessions cash. A late-night showing has been suggested, for ""better crowd experience"" (translation: younger, louder, more likely to throw popcorn).

Rogers’ anachronistic aspects are no longer the source of punchlines, and Evans persuasively conveys his decency without overstating the matter. Through their contained performances, he and Sebastian Stan, as Bucky Barnes (aka the Winter Soldier), give emotional heft to their characters’ friendship, a crucial element of the story. Just as crucial, Evans leaves room for doubt about whether Rogers is right to resist outside rules, even as the film clearly sides with him.....Downey, whose ace timing and effortless snark make him the movie’s chief comic relief, also provides pivotal emotional chords."

In addition The Avengers movies tend to be close to the 200 line, and since this movie involves many other characters and the trailers make reference to these last movies, I would expect the same ""feeling"" among the general public. Finally the addition of Spiderman generates some hype No other competing movies are opening the same weekend and those who might rival (Jungle book, Xmen) have a good distance among themselves.
