As they have Europe over a barrel when it comes to gas (see what i did there) and no doubt other resources too (wheat I understand is a large part of Russian and ukrainian exports to europe), while the crisis is ongoing commodity prices will go up purely because sanctions will reduce global supply, and thereafter because as far as possible russia will seek to recoup its losses. Businesses in the west who otherwise make money in Russia are now less able to do so and will similar issues regarding making up this shortfall, leading to increased prices. This is bound to have at least some impact and given last year the rate was over 5% I imagine the chance of it going down to be particularly probable and rate its decrease to 4% as very improbable"
