I'm basing that on time remaining and also the fact that in this interview published yesterday General Thurgood was asked if they're still on track to test the CHGB by the end of the year and he kind of dodged it by saying 3 tests in FY 2022. Doesn't inspire confidence to me, I think if they were on track for that he would have wanted to call attention to that. Leaving plenty of probability on one currently because it's possible the military doesn't like to tie that down in advance for security reasons."

I think it's most likely they're all successful. Leaving some on 2 and 1 in the event that the second test gets delayed to 2022 and on chances of test failures. Small chance of 4 in the event of a schedule change, but seems unlikely since the current schedule appears to already be described as aggressive."
