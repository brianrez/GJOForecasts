93350,2021-10-04T10:44:23Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"The Rulebook’s purpose is to transform the relatively short Paris Agreement into a functioning system that mobilizes concrete climate action in every country around the world. While the Paris Agreement has provided the framework for international action, the Rulebook will set this Agreement in motion by laying out the tools and processes to enable its full, fair, and effective implementation. Countries agreed to develop and finalize the Paris Rulebook at COP24 (the 24th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) in December 2018. That was COP24 and we are now at COP26 still trying to complete the Paris Rulebook where the stumbling block is Article 6 of the Paris agreement. The issues are a) To find a solution to carbon markets where credits maybe credited/debited to gain a net zero status. b) Transparency: to encourage all countries to embrace a universal system of accountability. Each country maintains its own methods. c) Broker an agreement for these issues to aim for 1.5 degrees max uplift or at least below 2 degrees. d) Timeframes Proposed actions being: 1) To accelerate the transition from coal to clean power 2) Protect nature 3) Transition to zero emission vehicles 4) Promote Science and innovation The Rulebook does provide a risk of some countries double-counting emissions reductions where another country has also claimed them. Brazil and others have refused to close this loophole. The United Nations does not have an official agreement on how to implement international carbon trading. Australia, NZ and the EU have also sought to avoid agreement preferring to maintain existing rules that have delivered windfall credits. The world is transitioning from coal to clean power and to zero emission vehicles (to a degree, depending on the country) The problem of finalising the Paris Agreement would seem to hinge on accountancy/accountability international agreements and the need for transparency (so no trust) in each country to comply rather than the actions proposed or the intended aims. (One cannot envision Russia or China allowing for international monitors within their borders) Perhaps the Rulebook finalisation is achievable but compliance may be a problem. https://seors.unfccc.int/applications/seors/attachments/get_attachment?code=TY1H234DTG1HX0DK676QYVWQ8EDKKTH6"
88256,2021-10-04T03:30:37Z,1,[4.0],[4.0],"Well I sure hope so anyways, at the very least. Climate change today and the action required seems so much more convoluted, emissions alone are a fraction of the issue. I don't have much faith in these yahoos at this point based on what we have already NOT done, agreement or not. Lifestyles need to change, not just aerosol propellants. People need to hear science, believe it, act accordingly and demand environmental justice. At the moment climate change is vague and the general public oblivious (shame on our ""leaders"" it didn't exactly sneak up on us, it was ignored). Question is, is climate change finally real enough to convince the greediest humans/politicians to act appropriately? Will we act better as humans, think together, and look out for each other? Otherwise we'll just keep on this trajectory because capitalism is strong in this world. It has been dire for a long time yet look at us now, so far behind, barely fumbling with a ""rulebook"". Environmental (Housing and food security), racial, educational (internet), transportation rights are inseparable, or else ineffective. There are a lot of brilliant folks that should be heading these initiatives and making decisions while politicians can just shut the F up, generally. Isaac Asimov is spinning at 10,000 rpm in his grave, especially since Amazon just came out with the foundation series, low blow. Even for the not an astronaut ding dong space cowboy. I really hope I'm wrong and there's truly good news at the end of this conference."
