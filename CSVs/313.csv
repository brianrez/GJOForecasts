If it had a huge spike in late June, and Apple and Microsoft happened to be in dips, it's not inconceivable that Tesla could come out as #1 on one particular date. Amazon and Alphabet don't typically have such large swings, though, with the recent exception of Amazon's pandemic bump, so I largely rule them out. Apple is currently ahead of Microsoft and is typically ahead of Microsoft, but they overlap or nearly overlap frequently enough that I don't rule out Microsoft."

Profit and Op margins are already around 45% for MSFT and 29-32% for GOOGL. An increase in net income for MSFT may be due to lower sales&mark expenses. AMZN results for 3Q weren't that good.

Then the bankers. Then the railroad barons of the gilded age. Then the oil barons and industrialists from the late 19th century through the late 20th, fading briefly to Sam Walton (Walmart) and John Kluge (the TV industry). Then came PC software (Microsoft), followed by internet software (Google, Amazon, FB, etc.) and combinations of hardware, software and other technologies (e.g., Apple). Next will come AI/machine learning software and hardware companies (e.g., Nvidia, but also Amazon/AWS, Google, even Microsoft) plus a few random companies (e.g., Tesla, maybe Meta) that embrace technological acceleration. Ok, we're only talking about the next 7 months for this forecast, but look at the recent explosive growth of Nvidia and Tesla. Nvidia's market cap has more than doubled in the past 6 months. If it doubles again in the next 6, it would be at $1.5T, still well behind Microsoft, but catching up fast. Tesla also doubled in the past 6 months and was briefly even higher than that. It would have to substantially more than double in the next 7 months to touch Microsoft, but I don't think that's completely out of the question. If no other companies existed, I think it would be a toss-up between Apple and Microsoft at this stage in the forecast, as their market caps fluctuate; Apple was ahead of Microsoft not long ago. Google is slowly doing its thing, and I don't expect it to offer serious competition to Apple and Microsoft in the forecast period. Same for Amazon and FB - I mean Meta."
