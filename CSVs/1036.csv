But that can't be the reason for a 50% jump in stock price. Then I discovered that even TSLA was traded at 750USD for the same few minutes... https://www.sg-zertifikate.de/webforms/images/cache/ChartImg/MaxAge1min/USD_TSLA/USD_TSLA/USD_TSLA/CBUL_Bid_Intraday.png The Nasdaq100 indication didn't move much. Probably a few more selected stocks from the tech sector did the jump (I found it for Apple, Alphabet, Alibaba, Amazon (traded at 4,400USD (!) 8-)) but also Boeing, Cisco, eBay, facebook,...), which may have functioned like a ""reverse flash crash"" and cause heavy losses to a few brokers and/or FinTechs - maybe it'll be named the ""Flash bang of Nov 24,2020"". Obviously, what just happened is either the result of a cyberattack, a fat finger trade, or an automated portfolio management/algorithmic trading machine gone wild. Maybe one of the market makers got confused with currencies (operational risk, which should definitely not happen) and placed an iceberg order denominated in EUR but with the USD-value instead - which was then filled immediately. Or some traders, who use trading systems where you leave out the first two digits when entering the price limit for speed's sake, interpreted the figures the wrong way: it's easy to figure out, how an order for TSLA limited at [5][2]7.50USD turns into a 750.00USD order. Or one for UBER at a limit of [5][0].72USD turns into an order at 72.00USD. I'd love to review the full order books and times'n'sales tables now. I'm pretty sure we'll read about this later. EDIT: It seems this mirage was a technical issue at Société Générale's internal price aggregation and has not caused any sales on stock exchanges."

If the news was out on Friday already after market close, it propelled UBER to 48.54USD per share at intraday high in the after hours-trading on Nasdaq, which means the market, which means investors probably appreciate selling off an important, yet non-profitable, loss-generating long shot and concentrating on the likely profitable business with driver-based ride-hailing, getting rid of many potential risk of law suit and capital intensive, heavy investment-requiring visionary business for the sake of the mere financial survival of the company. Short term, this may bring the valuation close to 90bn USD; however, I expect some market turmoil ahead before resolution of the question, which would bring down the Nasdaq and thus tech companies more than proportionately, so that I guess Uber will end up in the range of 65 to 80bn USD, but likely not less than that."

Latest news on shrinking Uber's staff was quick and a right decision in order to stop negative cashflows, but it is also telling about the seriousness of the situation. Uber has been one of those ultimate ""growth by disruption"" stories, but growth is nowhere to be seen. Thus, stock price might end up somewhere around 25 USD at year end, which at the current number of stocks outstanding (1.73B) means a valuation of 43.5B USD. Still some investors will be structurally forced to invest into large cap tech companies, and Uber may be their first choice. 25 USD then may seem reasonable compared to its IPO price."
