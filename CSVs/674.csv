Brazil and US FAA are the only authorities to recertify the aircraft thus far. An interesting note is that GOL, the Brazilian airline that operated the flight says 140 of its pilots have been trained in USA, presumably in the new training regime. Thus, there is certainly capacity in the training aspect. Nonetheless, this bodes well for the hugely awaited American flight AA718 departing Miami for NYC at 10h32."

Also they have a transparency plan so paying customers can switch flights if they are not comfortable. I'm betting most people who fly don't really pay attention to the type of aircraft they are booked on. And that the hassle of switching flights won't induce many to change. And that at least some of them will be willing to fly on it regardless of concerns. So as long as American keeps the max on its schedule, there will be commercial passengers. Since its scheduled for 29 Dec that means commercial passengers 29 Dec. I'm not making a stronger prediction because it is possible for a variety of reasons that the schedule could change and delay the first flight by a few days which would put it in the next prediction time block."

I haven't yet gotten the answer to that question, because I got distracted by the following The FAA website, which mentions a bunch of steps that have to happen before a plane can take to the air again, following approval to fly: https://www.faa.gov/news/updates/?newsId=93206 The website doesn't provide a timeline, but offhand I'd say that it seems ambitious for all the steps to be completed before Dec 2020. Aside from need to look further at outside view, I have a call in to a friend/neighbor who works for the FAA to see if I can get info on the ""inside view""! :-)"

The cost of failing again could theoretically devastate public trust in both the company and its overseers, the NTSB and FAA. With global air travel depressed and unlikely to recover before summer of 2021 to pre-pandemic levels, there is both a public trust and financial incentive to slow roll the reintroduction of the Max, lack of consumer demand, re-introduction of the 737 would exacerbate current excess capacity, rolling employee furloughs and layoffs. The latter would require a period of reintegration and recertification, regardless of aircraft.
