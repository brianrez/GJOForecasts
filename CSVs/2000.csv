Most importantly, much of the Cuban establishment sees the normalization of ties with US as mere economic necessity and a victory over the embargo, not a meeting of minds with America. I think a joint naval exercise with Russia would help to maintain their support for economic reforms and normalization of ties with US as Cuba moves further to open its economy. A joint naval exercise with Russia would also balance Cuba's strategic security with their newly declared intention to cooperate on security with the US. It may remind the US of the risks of alienating Cuba, applying leverage to the US to hasten its lifting of embargo measures. Thailand, a long-standing US military partner, has started leveraging their US military relations by conducting joint exercises with China after US criticism of the Thai junta. Egypt has done the same with Russia after US criticism of the Egyptian military coup. Nicaragua has seen fairly regular visits by Russian naval vessels and has a strong momentum of increasing military cooperation with Russia. Argentina- not likely with Macri's outreach to US and UK. Brazil may have similar hesitance considering its dire economic and political situation and the need to reengage with the US economically to help restart the economy. July is a fairly short time frame for the question to resolve yes considering there are not yet any announced exercises, but I will watch for news in the next 2 months to see if specific plans develop.

The expansion of NATO into Central and Eastern Europe is the most obvious example of the West extending its influence into former Russian spheres. According to the the principles of realist foreign policy, the actions of the West call for a response from Russia. Putin is all to happy to oblige when possible. With this background, it is perfectly conceivable that Russia would attempt to enhance and extend its power into the Western Hemisphere. That said, other commentators produced good numbers regarding the frequency of such exercises, the amount of time until the question closes, and the various foreign policy crisis being dealt with by Russia, to make the prospect of such an event seem very unlikely. If, all things held constant, the geopolitical situation was less of a mess (Syria, Ukraine, ISIS), then the likelihood of this event would go up by about 10-15% in the near term.

The Russian Black Sea fleet has business to attend to nearer home so seems unlikely to be sent to the Americas in the next 6 months without a very good reason. It is not clear which American countries would see value in holding joint exercises with Russia in the next 6 months. The more obvious possible candidates would be Venezuela, Cuba, Brazil (other left leaning countries either don't have a sea coast or don't have a significant navy). It would seem an odd time for Cuba to irritate the US by inviting the Russian Navy, as it has been working to improve US relations. The Brazilian President already has a lot of problems without creating more controversy by inviting the Russian as has Venezuela. All the left leaning American countries are suffering, like Russia, due to the lower commodity prices. Putin might want to project power to his American friends, but it would seem to be a low priority considering other issues he is dealing with. There would also be a risk in that the public in involved countries might not be as friendly as their presidents are. My conclusion is that Russia is busy else where with little to gain diverting ships to America, and currently there is little for the American countries to gain from being seen to be more friendly to Russia."
