Fast National Ratings are typically reported on the Monday following Sunday programming. This season's Fast National viewership numbers for Sunday Night Football are as follows: 10 September 2017: 21.559 million viewers (The Futon Critic) 17 September 2017: 18.460 million viewers (The Futon Critic) 24 September 2017: 14.537 million viewers (The Futon Critic) 1 October 2017: 14.009 million viewers (The Futon Critic) 8 October 2017: 14.853 million viewers (The Futon Critic) 15 October 2017: 14.423 million viewers (The Futon Critic) 22 October 2017: 16.741 million viewers (The Futon Critic) 29 October 2017: 12.666 million viewers The Futon Critic) 5 November 2017: 11.673 million viewers (The Futon Critic ) NOTE: This is an experimental short-term question intended to serve as 'forecasting fodder.' The idea is to give forecasters a way to get scored quickly on questions that demand difficult, multifaceted analysis. Sunday Night Football viewership in any given week may be influenced by long-term trends (e.g. a move to streaming services), or circumstances specific to game day (who is playing, what competing programming will air), among other factors.
