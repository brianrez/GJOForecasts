Between the 1930s and the 1950s periods of detention tended to be longer, spanning as much as two decades. from the 1960s to 1980s, we see only two cases of detentions, lasting only one and three years respectively. Skipping ahead to the more recent detentions of Trevor Reed, we see that he was released after four years. There does not appear to be any relationship between prisoners' USG affiliation and the length of their detention. However, the length of detention appears to have trended downward over time. Two other US nationals--Paul Whelan (four years) and Marc Fol (one year)--are being held by Russian authorities concurrently with Ms. Griner. Based on the length of the most recent historic detentions, I would say that Russian authorities tend to hold Americans for one to four years. Ms. Griner is near the low end of that range, so I don't think it is likely (5% chance) that she will be released before 8 November 2022."

The US is reluctant to give up more than one prisoner, especially a high profile arms dealer Viktor Bout (Merchant of Death). Everything about the situation tells me that both sides can't reach an agreement and it will likely take much, much longer than a month and a half to reach a proper deal. There is a chance the war in Ukraine ends and perhaps Griner comes back quietly after the war, but the chances of that are very unlikely.

However, the proxy war between the West and Russia, executed primarily by Ukrainian forces on Ukrainian territory confounds the issue as Russia has very few bargaining chips to hold the US to the table diplomatically. With a progressive US regime, I believe it is unlikely that they will allow a high-profile (for a variety of reasons) entity to remain imprisoned by Russia for a significant period. Regardless of care for its citizens, I believe that social pressure will push the US to make a deal to get Griner freed.

But balance that value with possibility that some influencers in the Russian intelligence establishment and a few Lubyanka old timers were never very pleased with Bout's freelancer style and are more than happy to see Uncle Sam continue to pick up the bill. Another possibility she will not leave before the date mentioned is that some in the Russian sports establishment would like to see how she responds physically and mentally to the living in a tough ""Camp"" environment.
