Further, the US elections is on November 2nd, and if President Trump does not win, the pressure for ByteDance to sell TikTok may dissipate.

Hence the original September 20th deadline. However, on Aug 14th, trump signed another executive order that gives Bytedance, Chinese parent company of Tiktok, 90 days to negotiation a sale. That extends the deadline to November 14 (with possible 30 day extension at Trump's discretion) .With that said, Trump also said during a past interview/conference that the original September 20th deadline still holds. He might meant it or he might just be confused. WH has sent mixed signals on Tiktok news. On the other hand, last Friday (August 28th) China revised a list of technologies that are banned or restricted for export for the first time in 12 years. The changes would apply to TikTok, and it can take up to 30 days to obtain preliminary approval to export technology.Some rumor is that China wants to stall the deal until post US elections. A lot of mixed news around Tiktok and the main snag right now is indeed whether AI technology would be included in the sale. In terms of successful bidders, if there is indeed a deal, I am estimating 80% for MSFT/WMT joint offer and 15% for ORCL and 5% for others (GOOG/TWTR/Investment Management firms). I had MSFT at 80% because from a business perspective, MSFT is better. Also, ORCL's 20bn deal seems low (granted it was with existing ByteDance investors) and the US administration will not like the kickback clause where they kick back 50% of profits back to ByteDance for 2 years. Summarizing all the above, my estimation for answers is 50% for it to come by September 16th given the advanced deal talk so far, 10% for September 16 and October 31st (with most probability mass concentrated between September 16th and September 20th) and 40% for it to fall either after November 1st or another bidder gets TikTok."

First publicly confirmed on August 2nd, the proposed TikTok acquisition comes in response to months of escalating concerns about Chinese ownership of an app used by millions of Americans. Microsoft, Oracle, and Triller have all put in bids to purchase TikTok’s operations in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand (roughly 30 percent of worldwide users) to allay the concerns. . On Friday, China quietly added personalized content recommendation algorithms to its list of export-controlled items, throwing the deal into chaos. The new export controls mean that any recommendation algorithm — like the one that powers TikTok’s For You page — will need government approval before it can be sold to a foreign company. [1] According to Harvard Business Review, between 70 and 90 percent of mergers and acquisitions fail.

Now, we consider the probability that a deal actually occurs before 1Nov. Trump's stated deadline is 12Nov, which is strongly pushing probability towards a deal occurring. However, we also consider that China's government has stated it must review the deal, and their antagonistic stance towards Trump.

Inside View - Factors would include Microsoft's view of Tik Tok's profitability, but also M's strategy for the acquisition. Perhaps they let Trump institute the ban on the application he is currently threatening to gain better pricing or other concessions. Thoughts: I am not sure what the likelihood is that Trump would actually follow through on the ban. It seems like a good way to provoke a popular backlash for little gain to his camp. My assessment is that that threat of the ban is giving microsoft some leverage in the acquisition, so they will want to move forward swiftly before Trump fails to follow through. There are also factors that would incentivize Miscrosoft to want to keep the application in operation (and have not gaps due to the ban), although I can see factors that would incentive the opposite action as well so that Microsoft could announce the application's triumphant return."

Microsoft has recently announced their interest in acquiring the app and, after initially threatening to ban the app altogether, Trump has announced his official support for the acquisition. This is important for two reasons. (1) It shows Microsoft is serious about buying it and believes it is in a strong enough position to openly admit that (no backdoor deals or playing it close to the chest). (2) It suggests that the President intends to ban the app if the deal were not to go through, meaning ByteDance would lose a huge amount of money if they don't sell. As such, Microsoft will likely get a deal on the sale and ByteDance would be able to avoid huge losses, a rare win-win for such a large acquisition. Once the app is banned within the US, however, Microsoft's incentive to buy becomes almost zero (and potentially negative given legal and administrative expenses) and ByteDance will have already absorbed the loss. Therefore, the situational economics suggest that the deal should at least be announced sooner rather than later."
