I see this more as an economy question than a covid question. I do think that there are some business travelers that are never going to travel like they used to because of the new normal and I think there is some tourism that will never come back. More important than how our habits will change is the fact that many people simply won't have the money to travel. I ultimately think airlines will shut down many routes and airline fees will rise above what they were pre-covid. I'm just slightly afraid that one freak travel day will push this question over the top.

Previously I hadn't considered that even though it's best not to travel, there are still many people who will do so for their own reasons (e.g. this article entitled ""Millions traveling for Thanksgiving despite surging Covid-19 cases"" from https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/thanksgiving-travel-2020-pandemic/index.html). This, coupled with the fact that there are seemingly viable vaccines that will likely go into circulation from January 2021 means those who would respect CDC guidelines and refrain from travel currently, will be able to early/mid 2021. Furthermore, I think there will be a BURST of travel when herd immunity is achieved. I think people who have not been able to travel internationally/domestically over the last 8 months will feel compelled to have a vacation as soon as they are able, meaning the number of travelers will exceed the same day number from 2019. Therefore I'm shifting my forecast from a left skewed distribution to a gaussian distribution centered at the interval of 'Between 1 April 2021 and 30 June 2021'."

Clearly summer is peak travel time with the Memorial, 4 July, and Labor Days the penultimate times. Business travel may be premanently reduced going forward which will kill profitability for airlines and raise prices for everyone, thus reducing overall air travel going forward. Almost a million brave souls took to the skies this Labor Day, relieving pent up demand. When will this double? If a vaccine is effective and available to many by end Q1, there is a chance summer holidays by air will recover. So this question is about when will an effective vaccine be available to the masses. The fourth bucket has the highest chance of hitting 2M as it has both July 4 and Labor Day and the most time to get vaccines in people."

There's a small chance holiday travel pushes it over 2 million this year, but I think that's unlikely, and increases in screenings have grown more slowly recently. Next year prior to March it could exceed, but those don't make the list of busiest travel days and if a vaccine is available by year end it might not be widely available enough by March to ease concerns. Because the peak is in summer I think that's when we'll likely exceed 2 million, with a low chance that it isn't exceeded by October of next year.

I doubt the late winter - early spring will bring much change - if flu doesn’t spare us as it did Australia, we won’t be in great shape. In addition, even though a vaccine is expected by late Dec or early Jan, it will take until the end of summer to vaccinate everyone who is willing to be vaccinated. The vaccines will start with front-line healthcare workers, essential employees, and elderly/high-risk people - all of whom are less likely to be flying under the current circumstances anyway.
