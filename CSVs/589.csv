A surge of defaults in the Oil & Gas sector and retail spurred the growth in default rates in 2020. Those markets have seemed to stablized a bit and did not see huge defaults in Q4. However, most experts see the default rate continuing to rise into 2021. The latest forecast survey from S&P Global saw 57% of respondents thinking the default number will be above 5% by year end. Although we may not see the large volume of defaults we saw from Jun-Sep last year, it is likley that a steady stream of defaults through at least Q3 pushes the rate above 5% at some point."

22690,2021-01-12T07:41:20Z,3,[42.0],[30.0],"Ok I may have been thinking about this wrongly. Following my previous comments and along the lines of the discussion between @ForecastingNovice and @SE_Meyer, I had assumed that you would need a worsening economic environment to cause a very bad quarter of defaults, for a positive outcome to this question, as Aug20 to Dec20 had been relatively benign and this was a trailing rate. Now I am not so sure. The links that @SE_Meyer provided, reminded me that the individual loan items are what is important. Given the majority of loans expire in the first half any year, in H1 21 there is a high chance that we get significant defaults from Entertainment or Leisure companies, who simply won't have the cashflow to repay notionals, and bankruptcy may actually be preferable to the pretend and extend scenario I had been pushing. Indeed, Fitch has 40% of leisure/entertainment, 18% of retail and 9% of the healthcare/pharmaceutical loan sectors defaulting this year (https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-us-leveraged-loan-default-insight-default-activity-slows-in-november-loans-of-concern-total-declines-20-11-2020). From what I can gather their analysts have been on the conservative side, but they still see 7-8% default rate in 2021. Fitch was still predicting 4.5% for 2020 in late December, and they may have a slightly difference universe to S&P, so even haircutting their number by 0.5% for conservatism and 0.7% for the spread between the two agencies, you would still get 5.8% for the year. If these defaults were due to loans maturing as opposed to breaching of covenants (less likely), it would put most of defaults into H1 21."

So with Aug20 to Dec20 having had low notional defaults, you effectively need another quarter like Q2 20 (the highest quarter since 2009) to get there . If I stay true to my belief that low rates, lite covs, monetary and fiscal stimulus and a vaccine roll-out will dampen out defaults, or at least allow a ""pretend and extend"" scenario, I need to drop my initial prediction materially, so going 12%, and will look to the monthly numbers to tweak."

Combining Yellen's, Powell's and Biden's stimulus plans with the vaccine rollout (the 4.17% peak was before the vaccine announcement and since then rates have come down), I will project the under.

And it's likely more government relief is to come with Democratic control of Congress and the presidency. The default rate peaked a few months ago and has slightly declined. I'd guess it'll fluctuate over the next few months and probably won't really decline significantly anytime soon.
