Considering that since the launch of Disney+ only 5 months ago it has already racked up 50 million paying subscribers its rate of growth says it should be upwards of 55 million. I don't expect a drop-off anytime soon either as market leader Netflix has over 170 million paying subscribers many of whom pay for multiple streaming services as well. I think it's also important to note that none of the market leading streaming platforms are present in China. Disney as a cooperation has had a strong history with China and although this may not produce direct number growth by may 12th its promising for investors and supporters of the platform.
