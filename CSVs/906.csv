After a tumultuous first half to the year, with both demand and supply side shocks that created incredibly high levels of market volatility, in the past month the oil price has steadied. Part of the volatility this spring was created by unexpected lower demand as lockdowns were rolled out around the globe. Air travel was at 4% of usual levels in the US. That represents an unprecedented low for an industry that uses a large amount of oil based fuel. Most importantly, the reduction in oil demand was so rapid that there was a major glut of oil in the market. At one point, there was so much oil in Cushing, OK that the front month oil futures went negative. Furthermore, Russia and OPEC were struggling to negotiation any sort of supply reduction. This also sent the price down precipitously earlier in the year. There is no expected OPEC news in the coming three weeks, which simplifies this question."

Have some weight on below $25 as that is a much larger forecast band then the others plus there is a risk of after the OPEC+ cuts end that everyone will start pumping too much before demand picks up. On the other hand there is the possibility that economic activity picks up due to no second wave and oil demand increases causing price to move up into the $35-$45. I find it quite unlikely that it reaches over $55 as that would require the economy running at full capacity. Even $45-$55 is highly unlikely with lots of industry such as airline, cruises, etc still not expected to run at high capacity. Also lots of petro states will have incentives to pump gas to keep their countries finances from getting devastated putting a ceiling on how high oil will go up without full demand."

This will support the spot market price, while non-industrial interest grows by hedge funds,financial institution and not least governments and sovereign wealth funds, who may consider WTI with its high quality chemical profile as a good investment alternative. Even developing countries such as India may start to stockpile huge amounts of crude oil and make up for the recent demand gap in order to be prepared for their future economic growth. Locations for stockpiling crude oil for physical delivery will have to be build or expanded very quickly to make that possible. Even companies such as the airline industry and transport may use the current low prices to hedge their exposure to future crude oil price raises on the futures market. After several rounds of overshooting in prices for the bottom and overshooting for the top, price for WTI may find a new equilibrium trend with a slight upward momentum at around 42 USD in early summer, when travel uses to spur consumption, if this price level is feasible and sustainable in the medium and long term for supply as well as demand. The largest uncertainty however comes from a (very unlikely) event of an escalating price war between Saudi Arabia (plus OPEC) and Russia, which in case damages every single party in the business and is therefore almost neglegible. This would result in prices at or below 30 USD with huge volatility. As trading physical crude oil and its respective financial futures together follows its own mechanics, rising prices in the futures may cause spot prices to trail higher until August 2020 with a day trading range of likely at least 1USD (ca. 2,2 %) on 13 August 2020."

Potentially a treatment would have been made as well, if not an outright vaccine, even if its not FDA approved. That'll boost consumer spending. However old fears will hamper the travel/ tourism industry into the summer, it surely will struggle to beat 2019 summer stats. If oil is gonna hit above $50-55 this year it will likely be in the months of June/ July. By August schools reopen, so less family vacations then. Outside of a war, or civil unrest in a critical oil producing country, the oil price will struggle to rise above $55 without deep production cuts from OPEC and Russia below current demand. But Trump needs Texas, so KSA will agree to cuts, plus their budget needs balancing. Look for it to be in the 45-50 range.
