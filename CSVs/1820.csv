The HYSY 981 is China's only deep sea oil rig, but other models are in development and may become operational next year (YIBADA). The location of HYSY 981 (MMSI number 413464330) can be found here and this marine traffic site can be used to track other vessels as well. Confused?

Use of military in the South China Sea in relation to energy firms: “Indonesia, which isn’t a claimant in the South China Sea drama but maintains an exclusive economic zone there, recently announced intentions to use its military to provide security for resource exploration activities.” Hugo Brennan, Asia analyst at Verisk Maplecroft said: “blurring the lines between commercial and naval actives in this way raises the potential for oil and gas assets to become targets in any militarised confrontation.” “Even as China prevents others from tapping hydrocarbon deposits located within its nine-dash line, it's in no rush to develop those assets. That's likely because 71.2 percent of total discovered reserves within the nine-dash line are ""not currently considered commercially viable,"" according to Brennan” (https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/20/beijings-military-threats-in-south-china-sea-worrying-for-companies.html)"

Also seems that China's strategy and rise will be based more on getting neighbors together. The US military presence in South China Sea could alter China's strategy which seems aimed at global leadership on a number of fronts. China's opportunities to lead are enhanced as the US President moves towards nationalism. In other words, we appear to be pushing China closer to its neighbors. I'm guessing that they will team up with the Philippines to drill, maybe even this year."
