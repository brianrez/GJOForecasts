Hard to see the BOE hiking rates in March before they really know how the economy reacts to the change, though they probably will hike rates in May. As to cutting rates, it is possible that the BOE could cut on 21 March if a hard Brexit is a certainty by then (extremely unlikely) and it is possible the BOE could do an ""emergency"" rate cut on 29 March if there is a hard Brexit right at the wire (even the the BOE has been trying to dissuade the market of the odds of a cut in a no deal scenario), but I put that chance at less than 10 percent."

The next rise is tipped to be in mid-2019 (so after the 1st of April 2019), thus I'm expecting no change from the current rate of 0.75%. Possible complications: - an earlier increase to 1.00% due to good economic performance. I think this is fairly unlikely given the track record of slow recovery and the uncertainly over Brexit. On the flip-side this could be deliberately squeezed in before Brexit to signal confidence. Say 10%. - a pre-emptive change as we get closer to Brexit and the likely effects start to become clear. Again unlikely because, frankly, I don't think anything's going to become clear until the last minute. Say 8% likelihood of a drop to 0.50% and 2% of an increase to 1.00%. - a reactive change due to unfolding events in the days leading up to Brexit itself. This is very unlikely because (Monday) the 1st of April 2019 is only a few days after (Friday) the 29th of March 2019, but if panic begins in the days before Brexit it seems plausible a change might be rushed through in time. Say 4%, split evenly between all the other possible answers."

(review forecast Dec. 20th) Guardian newspaper, Nov. 1: https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/01/bank-of-england-keeps-interest-rates-on-hold-no-deal-brexit Mark Carney, governor of Bank of England: “Since the nature of EU withdrawal is not known at present, and its impact on the balance of demand, supply and the exchange rate cannot be determined in advance, the monetary policy response will not be automatic and could be in either direction,” James Smith, economist at banking group ING, said it was far more likely that rates would be cut if negotiations ended in failure. “In a ‘no deal’ scenario, the Bank has suggested rates could go in either direction. However, given the wide-scale disruption that would likely occur, we suspect policymakers would ‘look through’ any spike in prices caused by a weaker pound, and cut interest rates or increase quantitative easing fairly swiftly.” Announcing the latest decision of its rate-setting committee on Thursday, the Bank said the MPC voted unanimously to keep the base rate at 0.75%. On the assumption that there is a smooth Brexit, the MPC thinks it will need to raise rates gradually from their current level of 0.75% in order to keep inflation close to its 2% target. Threadneedle Street believes businesses will unlock investment that has been put on hold while there has been uncertainty about the future UK-EU relationship, pushing growth up from 1.5% in 2018 to 1.7% in each of the next two years."

The latest reported inflation is 2.4%, moderately above the 2% Bank of England target. The latest letter about inflation being above target signals for an slow increase in Bank Rate (""All members agree that any future increases in Bank Rate are expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent."", https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/letter/2018/governor-cpi-letter-080218.pdf?la=en&hash=39D0CD86D203550BF0A8B18EF7235B1583A86503). If, at the time of the Feb 2019 report, inflation keeps moving back towards the target according to what the Bank of England predicts, this will lend support to keep Bank Rate stable at 0.75%. Conversely, if economic development does not pan out as predicted or the Brexit deal details provide additional uncertainty or economic strain, the BoE might be forced to raise Bank Rate earlier. At this stage I think it is close to a coin toss between steady and slightly increased rates. I am forecasting slightly higher probability of increased Bank rate compared to the ""Wisdom of the Crowd""-average forecasts because I think the global economic climate puts upward pressure on interest rates everywhere. A major update of this forecast is in order when new inflation data or Brexit deal details become available."
