Although there have been reports of the military struggling a bit, there is a wide gap between struggles and losing power. Even if there was serious pressure on the military (greater than there is now), there would most likely need to be extensive negotiations before the military loses power given that the military is supported by Russia and China (politically if nothing else). Thus, a transition of power would take the time that is in the order of months unless an actual coup against the military can take place, which is implausible (losing control of some territory would not be a coup or removing power from the military). This would put any resolution outside of this question's time frame."

One possible world in which this happens is one in which a foreign organization like ASEAN negotiates an agreement for an aesthetic release of power. This would presumably be a challenge, but it's not exactly unheard of that a country can be run under the threat of military rule. The possibility that a foreign superpower like India or China steps in with economic sanctions is unlikely, but boosted by Myanmar's rich rare metal reserves. It seems like the optimal outcome for all parties is that Myanmar remains uneasy, with the threat of military rule looming, although India is historically content to let Myanmar be."

While there has been consistent public protest activity (which is highly impressive to have sustained over such a prolonged period), the protests lack a mechanism for accountability or influence over the government, and the widespread poverty within the country makes subsistence the highest or sole priority for a large percentage of the population, rendering them unable or afraid to participate in any action against the military government. The continued counterinsurgency/civil war provides a pretext for continued military control as a 'state of emergency', while also worsening the conditions for those impacted or displaced by the conflict. Given the limited time that Myanmar has been a democratic state compared to being military or colonially controlled means that democratic norms and checks/balances are not well entrenched within the country, making it easier for them to be overrode and warn down by junta control."

They've given themselves until Aug 2023 to complete that project and hold another election, so it is also very unlikely to happen within 9 months."

The military in Myanmar has the reputation of being very cohesive and of behaving as a unitary interest group, which gives it a strong staying power. It also has a long history of maintaining itself in power in spite of popular opposition. The civil opponents in cities are likely becoming worn out and the armed guerilla groups in ethnic enclaves do not appear to be very strong and probably have a difficult time finding international backers. It is going to be a long protracted fight that could last several more years."
