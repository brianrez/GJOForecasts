The findings, as yet unpublished, suggest Brazil may need to change its Zika response strategy, and it is grim news for a country in the grip of a mysterious epidemic, just two weeks before tens of thousands of visitors arrive for the Olympics. Zika was found in Culex quinquefasciatus in the northeastern city of Recife, ground zero for the outbreak of fetal brain defects caused by the virus – and this species is 20 times more common there than Aedes aegypti, which until now has been identified as the main vector. “It’s very bad news for Brazil,” said Constancia Ayres, the entomologist who conducted the research and who has been a lonely voice insisting that it was risky to focus exclusively on Aedes aegypti as Brazil scrambled to respond to the Zika outbreak over the last year. “We have a national program for controlling Aedes – but we have nothing for Culex – so if Culex is an important vector then we have to start from zero.”"

It is forcing officials to rethink, once again, the guidance for health care providers and the general public on how to limit the danger of infection, as the pool of those who could be at risk widens. Much about how the virus works is a mystery, and it remains challenging to detect; 80 percent of those infected show no symptoms. For those who do get sick, the illness is often mild, and there is no treatment. But Zika can pose a dire risk to pregnant women. It targets developing nerve cells in fetuses and can lead to a birth defect called microcephaly, in which babies are born with abnormally small heads and brain damage. It may also cause developmental problems after birth."

In an astonishing bio-engineering breakthrough the genetic code for the Zika bearing mosquito has been crossed with the fruit bat and the entire country of Brazil has been sprayed with an adjuvant catalyst. ""Mosquitoes f**k with the human genome, we are striking back!"" an unidentified spokesman (who sounded a lot like Arnold S.) said when reporters sought to confirm this story. In addition, billions of male mosquitoes carrying this genetic code have been released over Rio. Given the short life cycle of the mosquito, by the time the Olympics open, this operation should be complete. Why Zika rackets? While one might ignore a tiny mosquito bite, no one is going to ignore a fruit bat sized insect sucking blood out of their ankles or necks. The Zika rackets are just a handy way to swat them away and with this breakthrough, there will be no further need for CDC or WHO updates to the warning system. ""Trans-species experiments like this will soon be commonplace"", the spokesman concluded. A side benefit is that everyone ""will not need screens or mosquito netting. Small gauge chicken wire is sufficient to keep the fruit-bat-sized-Zika-mosquito's out of bedrooms and hotel rooms. With this breakthrough, we expect to see Brazil move up from third world status."" Officials in Texas are considering installing anti-Zika-bat-mosquito artillery along their southern border.

The letter points out that Rio is at the epicenter of the Zika epidemic, with 32,000 cases so far, and the holding the games there–with all the associated travel involved–may accelerate the spread of the dangerous Brazilian strain. The newly emerging risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome makes it clear that Zika virus presents a threat to everyone. The Rio Olympics are likely to make it worse. Anyone planning to visit Rio for the Games should take all the precautions they can, but the best plan might be simply to stay home."" Comments: From a risk perspective, I still firmly believe that heading to Rio for the Games would be a very BAD idea. Everything about this whole venture, governance, infrastructure, security is highly questionable. Most security/risk/intelligence pros who have commented on the situation in the IC forums agrees. The mosquitoes and their breeding habits grab most of the media space, but heck.... the sexual transmission part scares me..... and we're also talking about danger to the UNBORN here! There are times when an explicit COMMAND by the government may be appropriate for all the sheeple who need guidance: https://youtu.be/OWwOJlOI1nU See also @ravel June 18 and 19 posts.

One is the tiger mosquito, A albopictus; this rapidly expanding Aedes species lives in close contact with humans and feeds not only at dusk and dawn but also in the daytime—a fact that underscores its dangerous character. In a world marked by globalization and trends of urbanization—which imply a potential source of human-caused perturbations in ecologic balance, and a constant increase in international air travel—Zika virus appears to have a large capacity to spread (like dengue and chikungunya viruses) and colonize new environments.
