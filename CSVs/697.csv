This IFP should be reposted early 2022 with a 12-month duration. Affirming forecast for the passage of time. The White House, 'Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jen Psaki, August 26, 2021: https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/08/26/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-august-26-2021/ Clips from briefing: 'MS. PSAKI: You’re right. And I appreciate that question. I think it’s important for people to know and understand that the threat that is posed by having thousands of U.S. military on the ground — still currently on the ground, implementing a mission, committed to a mission, as you heard General McKenzie and the President also say — that is a threat. They are a target. People gathering around the airport — that is a threat; that is a target. But ISIS’s ability to target individuals who are on the ground in Afghanistan is very different from ISIS’s ability to attack the United States and attack the homeland. And we will maintain and continue over-the-horizon capacity with a presence, in partnership with countries in the region, to ensure that they don’t develop that ability.'

How long planning is required for such an act? 2. Who are the likely organizations/group of individuals involved? The answer to 1. will tell us, if there is really a planning, depending upon the time period, will it be possible to execute in Sep 2021. Also, it is possible that intelligence has already got the lead and is working to thwart or waiting to get more details to apprehend the main actor (state, etc.). It is also difficult to predict because there are no indicators (stealth operation) and the information is likely available with both the parties, or a third party who is strategically aligned with any one of the main parties at a very 'top' level. As of public indicator, one may note that Iran has vowed a 'revenge' for the killing of its general in Jan 2020. Hence, there is a possibility of CCTA."

There are few concerts, sporting events, or other public events right now where terrorist groups might hope to inflict mass casualties. There are very low levels of commuting on subways and trains. Except for Thanksgiving and Christmas, which have already passed, airline travel is low. The low level of passengers would make the pay off smaller and the likelihood of detection greater, in the minds of terrorist organization planners. Terrorist groups like to conduct surveillance of their targets for a number of months and do dry runs to test their plans. COVID significantly disrupts the terrorist planning and attack cycle. Our poor ability to get the vaccination program up and running will continue to suppress public events through May, in my estimate. June through August does not allow much time for target selection, planning, training, dry runs, and everything else that follows in the attack cycle."

I do think that once the Trump influence is gone, be it next week or in 4 years the situation will gradually, very gradually improve. If you have never read the book ""The Fourth Turning"" do so now, the predictions made by the authors in 1996 have proved to be amazingly accurate beginning with the ""911"" terrorist attack. I would add that the entire book is based on a theory of generational cycles that have a certain truth to them but that not every review of the book has been favorable or every prediction completely accurate. I read the book when it first came out and my initial reaction was that it was too fatalistic but after 911 I read it again and I could see the generational pattern the authors described. Their predictions would indicate this period in history specifically as a time of profound change that in their opinion would occur. The possibility of violence and terrorism is highly probable in their view but not inevitable. I have found that many readers of this book go straight to the worst case scenario and add their own dark opinions to it. I am not of that mind."

I chose 1990 as a starting point because it seems like the motivations of many terrorist actors during and before the 1980s bear little resemblance the motivations of most terrorists today. For instance, many of the terrorist attacks of the 1970s and 1980s were committed by Puerto Rican nationalist/separatist groups, Jewish nationalist groups, and Armenian militant groups. By contrast, many of the terrorist attacks since 1990 have been carried out by the now-usual suspects: Jihadist terrorist groups and far-right groups."

85449,2020-09-14T09:37:41Z,1,[45.0],[45.0],"Looking at the combined work of @Tinned_Tuna and @Ryan-Beck, the average integer between major CCTAs since 9/11 = 4.66r yrs, with one or more similar incidents (if lesser) occurring almost every year between 2001 and 2015. While I can see why some are interpreting the relative lack of CCTAs since 2015 and pandemic as factors likely to diminish the probability of another CCTA within the next year, the continuation of mass shootings and heightening of civil unrest, coupled with increased online networking among far-right, conspiracist and other groups point to a disintegration of the social contract that, given basic group psychology, I believe could easily tip over into one or more CCTA actions within the next 12 months. As @TDHesslink has said, the November election & 20th anniversary of 9/11 are two potential inflection points. Acceleration of conspiracy theories surrounding the pandemic and the origin of the west coast wildfires are two others. As decision-makers seek to deflect responsibiity for the devastating outcomes of their choices, it seems likely that benevolent and professional institutions may become the focus of blame and attacks. Given the increased amount of time many have spent online this year I think it's highly likely that potential lone wolves will have already begun pairing or collecting into potential 'wolf packs' currently sitting on a range of hair triggers: the 'wrong' election result; the 'wrong' lockdown; the 'wrong' vaccine; food shortages, civil rights demonstrations and so on."

Not including 9/11 anniversary in the prediction window lowers probability. The presidential election is more of a wildcard. Fear of retaliation by current administration is high and avoiding attribution would be important potentially making labeling a event resulting from parties working in concert difficult. If this administration serves another term, that fear will remain. If a new administration is elected it would take time to evaluate whether a similar strong fear of retaliation would exist. One item that might complicate this projection. If protestors and counter-protesters surrounding any issue became involved in a violent exchange what weight of 'working in concert' and 'intent for large number of casualties' would be considered? Certainly all protests have some measure of working together and while there may not be direct intent for mass casualty at the outset, a real-time escalation from a single intended act of personal violence could turn into a much larger event. Is it a stretch for some prosecutor or district attorney to label some loss of life or act of violence during a protest as a terrorist event and attempt to take legal action with that body of law?"

At least two shootings in 2020 (sorry, i forgot the names...) come to my mind which were eligible, if they a) had more then one perpetrator[1] or b) were ""intended to result in large numbers of casualties"" [5], which is sometimes hard to tell.
