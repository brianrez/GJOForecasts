Although Sanders wins in NH and Nevada have boosted his polling Biden seems to have held on to a healthy poll lead (5% this week on average). My model suggests a lead such as this equates to 70% chance of victory. I'm going to downgrade this to 67% though as my model has been heavily influenced by the PPP poll (a Biden win by 15 points). I'm also thinking Sanders has a lot of momentum and his popularity could improve by Saturday.
