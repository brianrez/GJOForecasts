Same reasoning as before, trip discouraged by defense etc. However, emotional / behavioral factors made me reassess likelihood of a trip during the current Asian trip (hence, 28 July to 31 August now at slightly more than 1 in 3 times). Being 81, she might retire after this mandate and a trip to Taiwan might be some sort of legacy for her. In the past N. Pelosi did some bold move in terms of China US relations: ""In September 1991, when I was CNN’s China bureau chief, then-U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi got me arrested. On a trip to Beijing with a congressional delegation, one of her colleagues alerted me that Pelosi and two other congressmen were planning to slip away from their official escorts and visit Tiananmen Square.
