You need only to to the graph of total registrations and look at the jumps that occurred between 15 Dec and 31 Dec in both 2014 and 2015. http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php. Hence, I am allowing some probability of a similar jump this December. Unfortunately, this year is a little strange because over the last few months there have been reports of a trickle of refugees back into Syria- hence, it is theoretically possible that the year-end rush could result in a surprise large decline in the number of refugees rather than an increase- though I am not forecasting for this at the moment."

This will continue to happen and with the strong action against ISIS in Syria and Iraq, its possible that refugees try to move back. A feature of continuous conflicts in other regions, such as Lebanon for example, is that refugees want to return home as soon as possible, and many times too soon. The level of refugees has been flat pretty much since the start of 2016 and has even decreased somewhat. Possible anti-immigration policies in Europe won't be implemented before 1 January 2017."

The rate was far greater the first two years of the war. The rate was approximately 75,000 a month in 2015. There is approximately 4.8 million refugees registered end of September 2016. The recent government offensive against Aleppo likely raises the rate of registered refugees for the remainder of the year. Aleppo still has an estimated 1,000,000 civilians."

I feel, at present there is a lull in proceedings and without some major new outbreak, numbers will remain low. One issue that may lead to sudden increase in registrations would be if the non registereds in Turkey (or Lebannon) suddenly decided to move to one of the other countries, where they would be registered."

If you believe their stats, 500,000 refugees arrived over Christian New Year's weekend! Obviously there was either a delay in processing paperwork that had been lying around (and a rush to get it in for the New year) or they reclassified a large number of people as refugees- haven't done any digging to determine what actually happened, but this increases the risk of an large, unexpected change in the refugee numbers around year-end."

Registered refugee counts in both countries are slowly decreasing since then. Turkey also seems to have closed the border with some reports of Turkish military shooting on Syrians to keep them from crossing it."

Even more specifically, how probable is it that we see these kind of increases within the last four months of the calendar year?"
