Prior to the pandemic, it was on a spending spree buying competitor theaters and renovating existing locations. This expenditure is coming back to bite the company as theaters have remained unprofitable due to covid restrictions and public perception of risk. The company continues to seek a lifeline, but it is likely it will need to restructure through bankruptcy. This is compounded by the fact that it is ineligible for some forms of governmental aid. If AMC can figure out how to stay operational through the spring, it will be unlikely that it will declare during the Apil-May-June timeframe as it anticipates a summer resurgence in ticket sales due to weather, lockdown fatigue, and vaccine availability. If this rebound happens it is possible that it moves into the second half of the year on better financial footing."
