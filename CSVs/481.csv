If all restrictions were lifted today, we would expect cases to start to rise nationally within a week. The previous rise in cases offers an upper limit on how fast reported cases would likely rise. If reported cases rose equally fast from today's case rate starting tomorrow, 40M would be reached in about 41 days. But in reality, it would take time for cases to turn around, and cases wouldn't rise as fast because so many more people have some immunity now. Moreover, given recent experiences, I do believe most locations would impose restrictions before cases reached previous levels. There are 77 days left to September 30. The longer cases stay low, the less possible 40M looks before Sept 30."

With that extrapolated out, they'll be at ~30.5 June 23 and I wouldn't be surprised to see numbers over 150k/day again shortly after. Say 32m June 30.

If cases were to increase a bit for a while, 40M could be reached before Aug. 31. And as @Ravi-Ivaturi1574726980 points out, wedding season is July & August. And there are 114 days before Sept 30. I assign only 1% to the July 1 to 31 bin because for 40M cases to be reached over the next 53 days, cases would have to average 206k or higher, and that would require cases getting very out of control again. I don't think state authorities will let that happen after their experiences with the recent surge, but maybe I am wrong. Update 6/10: Looks like cases will make it to <100k, maybe even to ~50k.

This would add in the ballpark of 5.2M cases to the current total of 28.9M, for a total of 34.1M by Aug. 7.

But, Covid cases could surge at any moment if restrictions are lifted too soon, because the virus is still spreading rampantly in many locations throughout the country. Also, now through October is the season in which Covid is likely to spread the most in India based on last year's experience with Covid and previous experience with all other respiratory viruses. So, this question is really about whether India will keep enough restrictions in place to limit virus spread. I suspect, though, that most or all state and regional governments do not want to repeat the recent surge and so will try to keep cases at a lower level. So, I am weighting later dates more."

If lockdowns continue and cases keep falling, cases could plateau around 50k/day or less. But it should be kept in mind that the seasonal peak is likely to be around mid-September, so if restrictions are lifted too early, we can expect cases to come roaring back. In other words, substantial restrictions will likely need to remain in place through September to prevent a resurgence.

The extensive lockdowns now in place will I think have the fastest and most pronounced effect on the reduction in case numbers, and any prolonging of these, even for a short time (one or two extra weeks?) will have a cumulative effect of slowing the total case increase and extending the time it takes to reach 40M. However, based on how the government has acted to date (and comparing with Brazil, Mexico and the US), combined with the scale of the issue and the new variant, I think numbers will still cross 40M in the near term. I'm allowing a few extra weeks to factor in the temporary restrictions, and extending this to allow for a lower base level being reached before numbers flatten out.

Looking at the daily cases, India appears to have hit their second peak (which occurred ~6 May with ~412,262 cases confirmed in a single day). Their first peak resolved at the same rate it grew (bell curve) therefore I forecast that by 29 July 2021 they will have hit 32.1 million cases and then plateau from that point. I do not believe they will hit 40 million by October if they take the same measures that saw the first wave resolve and vaccinations continue. Of-course I am concerned about emerging variants that may evade vaccine effectiveness, and also 'corrective reporting' which would see the numbers surge to better reflect Covid-19 spread over the last 12 months. Some reports suggest that the actual number of Covid-19 cases in India could be 10 times what WHO is currently reporting (https://scroll.in/article/994619/india-is-undercounting-covid-19-deaths-heres-how-to-work-around-the-problem, https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/04/30/992451165/india-is-counting-thousands-of-daily-covid-deaths-how-many-is-it-missing). Should there be a correction, we may find India hit 40 million cases back in September 2020. Until that happens, or something catastrophic occurs, I do not believe that India will see 40 million cases before 1 October 2021."

The previous forecast for India/SE Asia was clear: the authorities would do too little, too late. Now there are many restrictions, but will they lift them too soon? Moreover, restrictions are imposed in many places, but spread in areas outside larger cities is increasing, and such spread will largely go unmeasured and not enter into this forecast. In part because of ongoing spread outside larger cities, as soon as restrictions are lifted, cases will come roaring back. Will the authorities in different places lift restrictions in 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, longer? The federal government imposed extensive restrictions for long durations in 2020, but is there sufficient political will for comparable restrictions now? And restrictions would need to be imposed for longer time periods now because cases are at a much higher level now. I just don't have a feel for what will happen yet. The only thing that is becoming increasingly clear is that 40M will likely not be reached by July 31. The average cases/day would need to be ~199k/day for the remaining 77 days before July 31 for India to reach 40M cases. India will likely see ~200k/day in ~11 +/-1 day, probably adding just under 3.5M to the total number of cases. Then cases/day would need to stay under an average of about 180k/day until July 31 to stay under 40M. One smaller problem is that the Indian gov't has relied on spectacularly amateurish modeling efforts to guide its actions, and it's not clear whether that will change. https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/government-backed-model-to-predict-pandemic-rise-and-ebb-lacks-foresight-scientists/article34479503.ece The larger problem is that the government will face giant pressure from all sides to keep things closed and to open things up, and it will likely do whatever it thinks at the moment will be the best course for improving the re-election chances of BJP candidates. So this is really a forecast about Indian politics, and I'm not sure yet which way the wind will blow."

Vaccinations at 9.8% have single dose and increasing ~.1%/day. Fully vaccinated @ 2.5% and increasing ~.1%/day. ~70M doses being produced/month. Vaccination is unlikely to be a major factor in slowdown for the next couple months at current rates so near term results depend on lockdowns. Pressure is on for a lockdown but the 23% contraction the last national one caused is pushing against that action. Some lockdowns have started indicating some appetite but they are inconsistent and may only cover 1/3 of the population currently with varying levels. Tests and positivity rates are raising but looking at a potential plateau. If it is a plateau and stays constant it would be 45 days to 40m. Even if this is a peak it will likely hold steady (ish) for another week putting the May 16 total at ~25M. To July 31 would then mean an average daily rate of 335k, which is possible but likely still high, especially since appetite for hard controls seems to be on the increase and they seem to be aggressively increasing available vaccines. To August 31 means ~200k daily count between May 16 and then. To Sept 31 means ~110/day avg. The low rates previously seen are unlikely to be possible given the increased transmissibility of current variants. I'm leaning slightly toward September, but it could fall on either side."

As stated by someone below testing is reaching saturation so if the country cannot process anymore tests than it is currently doing then all that is required is for positivity rate to come down from where it is. Prof M Vidyasagar, the government's mathematical modelling expert predicts the 7th of may to be the peak. I know there is some serious differences between the countries (population density, health care, working habits) but if you compare the figures to the US they peaked at a 7 day rolling average of 255000 cases over the next 53 days they added 6.4 million cases. Indias current 7 day average is 390000 if we assume this is as predicted there peak then they would only add 9.79 million cases if they have the same reduction as the US by July 1st."

Cases are still growing, but testing is leveling off and nearing saturation. Overall test positivity rate is 21% for the country, 32% in New Delhi (down from a peak of 36%), and varies across states; it's as high as 62% in Rajasthan, and as low as 5% in Mizoram. Because testing is nearing saturation, it's hard to know what's really going on. There does appear to be an inflection point in the 7day average of cases/day somewhere around April 16 to 21, but it's hard to know whether that's real. Actual cases could be continuing to climb exponentially out of control. Currently, total at 21.49M, with 390k cases/day and still slightly climbing. Obviously, most cases are being missed, but confirmed cases still give us a useful measure of the size of the problem. In the press, I see speculation that cases in New Delhi and Maharashtra will likely peak in May, other places in June. I'm not sure I see why they should peak in May. Anyway, 18.51M to go to get to 40M. 55 days left before July 1; would require 337k cases/day to reach 40M by July 1. On April 6, there were 93k cases/day (7day average), so things can go up and down very quickly. I suspect we have weeks more to go, though, before the epidemic in India truly turns around. If one estimates that India is underestimating deaths by ~10x, then they have reached about as many deaths as a proportion of the population as the US has. But they don't have nearly enough vaccinations or control measures to slow this down yet. I think India will easily reach 30M cases by July 1. If the epidemic peaks in the next couple weeks or so, then 40M cases may not be reached by July 1. But if it peaks around June 1 or after, then I think 40M is assured, unless they run out of testing supplies. I think the peak of the epidemic for the country as a whole may not be reached until sometime in June. On the other hand, areas outside major cities may have limited testing capabilities, so the true peak may not show up in the testing data. Still, I think it's very likely that India will reach 40M cases before July 1. https://time.com/6045791/india-covid-forecast"
