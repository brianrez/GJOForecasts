If negligence is shown near the seats of the main fires, why should consumers pay for corporate negligence? Brown is already warning everyone that fires are 'new normal' but unless he sees a way to control energy costs, California could be priced out of some industries - and hitech industries are big power users. High voltage power lines running over wilderness areas are a core probelm which could be solved by more distributed power generation (e.g. local solar, heat pump etc) but even so, dried out forest is flammable. Where would the negligence suits go then?"

62460,2019-03-16T04:09:52Z,1,[20.0],[20.0],I'm not sure this question is worded properly. The public utilities need to operate and the only source of cash is ultimately the rate payers. The real question is will the PUC force the equity holders to take a complete loss before the utilities can tap the bond markets. My answer is my weighting if whether the State will allow the shareholders of the public utilities to keep their equity while allowing them to issue bonds.
