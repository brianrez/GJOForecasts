However, he has consistently been 15 to 21 points net positive. The prediction markets are moving, ever so slightly, in his direction. The turnout in the 2018 midterm congressional election by democrats was almost exactly the same as it was in the 2016 general. The same did not happy for republicans, who were down about 20 percent. Normally, a 20 to 30 percent drop from presidential to mid-term elections is normal. The only down sides are that Edwards won four years ago largely to a prostitution scandal involving his opponent, and he needs a very high turn out."
