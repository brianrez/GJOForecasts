With other matters occupying most of these governments and questions about the costs of NATO to US being raised, I can't see a rush to ratify between 16 Oct (election day in Montenegro) and the US election on 9 Nov. If its not done before 9 Nov I would guess that it will be delayed until 2017."

14208,2016-06-22T03:01:34Z,8,[25.0],[14.0],I thought I had this figured out. But @redacted and others bring up interesting information. Time seems to be the most important factor here. This must be accomplished before Montenegro elections in a couple months or the risk of the socialists reversing the resolution. But there is also the referendum request placed yesterday by the Socialist Party. I increased my forecast because it seems there is a lot of interest in making this happen soon. So I'm going up a bit more until Montenegro elections or some other bit of info comes out to influence me.

It sounds like a big deal, but I was a little deflated after thinking about this a bit. First, it's a little unclear what these folks have in mind. ""More than 30 former senior U.S. officials and military leaders have urged the White House and Congress to formally approve Montenegro's accession to NATO by 2017."" Does ""by 2017"" mean before the beginning of 2017 or before the end of 2017? Probably the former, though I wouldn't stake my life on it. Second, Chuck Hagel et al. are engaging in hortatory speech and don't really have any control over this little adventure."

Glad you asked: ""Then you want to start in the NATO member states to ratify the accession agreement, [Vesko] Garčević [Montenegro Coordinator for NATO membership] said. My conclusion is expected by spring 2017 Representatives of Montenegro will be enabled immediately after the signing of the Protocol, the NATO meeting to attend, including the taking place in July NATO summit in Warsaw""[c].

This sentence is tantalizingly ambiguous. The year of Montenegro's independence was, of course, 2006[b]. But it's not perfectly clear whether the prepositional phrase ""in the year marking the tenth anniversary"" modifies the possessive phrase ""Montenegro's accession to NATO"" or the verb ""stressed."" If it's the former (as I think it is), then Darmanović is talking about joining NATO *on* the 10 year anniversary of Montenegro's independence, i.e., 2016."

The discussion focused mostly on what NATO’s response to Russian aggression in both Europe and the Middle East should look like. 'The Summit has to prove that the open door policy is the very center of the Alliance’s policy. The Enlargement of NATO is serving stability in Europe, so it must continue,' said Poland’s Ambassador to NATO, Jacek Najder. This just two weeks after Montenegro started accession talks with NATO, which could end in full membership by the end of the Warsaw Summit""[1]. The nice folks over at NATO are also making happy noises about Montenegro's joining the club: ""[T]he Chairman [of NATO's military command] expressed NATO’s commitment to continue its support to Montenegro and valued the constructive role that the country plays in the region, and through its contributions to NATO, EU, and UN missions, to international security""[2]. I don't think one should get *too* excited about this, but it does sound like things are proceeding a pace. That's probably with a slight (1%) increase in the likelihood that Montenegro will joint NATO by the end of 2016."

4785,2016-02-19T15:34:07Z,1,[66.0],[66.0],"On one hand, NATO has not accepted a new member in seven years (2009). On the other hand, Montenegro is the only one of four countries with a MAP that does not face internal NATO objections like, say, Greece to Macedonia. The last two countries to enter NATO (Albania and Croatia) did so about one year after the official invitation, even with some objections in 2008-2009 from Slovenia to Croatian membership. Therefore, I think the consensus of 33 percent is low. NATO is holding its Warsaw Summit in July, which should provide further impetus for NATO and Montenegro to get this done within the year. Russia has little economic influence over Montenegro, thus diminishing intimidation from Moscow as a depressing factor. And although NATO membership is supported by less than half of Montenegro (although that is divided largely along ethnic lines), the PM just survived a no-confidence vote, so he probably has enough domestic political support to finalize NATO membership sometime in 2016 (particularly since he appears to have survived the vote by generally committing to reforms that NATO coincidentally supports -- at least rhetorically. Moreover, Montenegro represents relative low-hanging fruit (compared to Georgia, Macedonia, and others) for NATO to demonstrate that it remains a confident organization in the wake of its perceived acquiescence to Russian aggression in Ukraine. And although Montenegro wouldn't be a game changer, it does represent a somewhat militarily significant move for NATO (a military alliance after all) in that it forestalls any concern about Russian air defense and missiles making their way into the Adriatic (like Moscow is positioned in the Baltics)."

Also, accession requires a unanimous vote of current 28 members. Despite this being a test case for NATO's open door policy, in 2016 at least one of the members is likely to ask ""what's the rush?

It was: ""It's just the beginning. Montenegro has to continue intensive reforms, especially in the sphere of fighting corruption and strengthening people's support for Montenegro's NATO integration."" My impression at that time, following the situation somewhat closely, was that this was an announcement of some modified (new) approach to the accession process. [Note that this announcement was communicated verbally, by the Secretary-General, and not in the form of a communiqué; and we know that as the legally authorized representative, we can rely upon the communications of the Secretary-General as to group actions and policies.] Perhaps this was a concession that needed to be made to secure the December invitation. I could, of course, be imagining this. I am extremely interested in hearing (seeing) authentic quotations of relevant officials on this matter. As far as I am aware, we have not heard a *single* statement by any relevant official as to the accession process, timetable, or whatever since the December meeting. Until I have a new data point, I am relying upon my interpretation of the only one I have. [I do recognize there are strong, determined interests behind moving Montenegro into NATO.

Montenegro has consistently stated its desire to join and has been part of the accession process since 2006. They have provided troops for NATO operations and have the support of a number of key members. They have been invited to join and are currently at the final accession stage that requires ratification from all other member states. New NATO members tend to be accepted into the organisation at summits. The next summit is in July 2016 in Warsaw and comments from NATO and Montenegro have pointed to this event as the target for full membership.

This time, the challenge and Balkan influence of Russia has to be taken into account. If things escalate, it is likely Montenegro may be accepted sooner. However, the freezing of the conflict in Ukraine, and western-Russian cooperation in Syria seems to be easing things. Also, Obama is on his way out and his administration is finishing up things and does not want to open anything new. There are also democratic reasons - Montenegro is the only country in Europe which DID NOT have a change in government since the communist times! The same, reformed communist party is in power since 1990! The severe democratic deficit affects the whole of the system, including defence reform. Therefore - 2016, slim chances. The only chance is that things get very bad between the West and Russia. But very, very bad!"

Considering that the US will need Russia's support or at least grudging co-operation in the struggle against ISIL, it seems doubtful that expanding NATO during this time would be useful, esp. with Montenegrins themselves divided. As NATO will not be sending in any troops against ISIL itself (http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/12/7/nato-wont-send-ground-troops-to-fight-isil.html), the need to placate Russia seems likely to be more important this year.

However, I cannot see this happening in 2016 - Whilst the olive branch of accession talks to join NATO has been given to them - NATO membership in the Southern European block is complex. Macedonia has had accession talks for several years, Serbia's stance after the bombings of 1999 is completely against it. Most of the southern european and balkan nations are generally pro-EU and anti-NATO. Most of them would rather have an alliance with Russia. The real reason I believe Montenegro was granted accession to NATO is a strategic one. Russia will not be happy having another country join the alliance, especially from the balkans - There may also be an economical impact on the nation in rebuttal to joining (which I don't believe will be 2016 .. although it will happen) from the Russians. There are many resorts, hotels and realestate which is owned by Russian citizens. They also frequently visit Montenegro for vacations, so this could also have impact - For the US and NATO, they are wanting to get just a little bit closer to Russia"
12875,2015-12-21T09:44:12Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],"Very unlikely. NATO does not need either the mighty Montenegrin Armed forces nor its territory for any of the NATO current tasks. The purpose of the moves around the joining is to prevent Montenegro from gravitating into someone else's orbit, most probably, the Russian one. That was the same reason why Romania, and most notably, Bulgaria were also pulled in the EU and the NATO orbits. Now that the statement of intention has been made the pace may be as slow as necessary. Besides, the internal situation does not unambiguously​ in favor of the joining, and chances are that Djukanovic may not last long enough to implement the plan."
