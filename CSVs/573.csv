There have already been a raft of op-eds calling on Biden to “hold Putin to account” and “lay down the law” but the reality is this meeting is a result of the fact that Russia has already grown too big and strong to push about any more – which has been Putin’s plan for over a decade and the Geneva meeting is the culmination of that (successful) effort.

Look at his calls with Xi and Putin': https://www.vox.com/22277212/biden-xi-call-china-russia-putin-foreign-policy Clips from article: 'Wednesday’s conversation underscores one of the earliest themes of Biden’s foreign policy: He won’t back down against major US adversaries, but he won’t just feud with them, either. Biden has so far followed a consistent blueprint for facing America’s great-power competitors: The US will criticize and even punish China and Russia for human rights abuses, cyberattacks, and predatory economic practices, but it will also seek to cooperate with them when interests align. Take Biden’s first call with Russian President Vladimir Putin in January. Biden pressed his counterpart on the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny — suspected by many to have been an assassination attempt ordered by the Kremlin — as well as the government’s arrest of hundreds of protesters who demonstrated in support of Navalny. Biden also affirmed America’s support for Ukraine’s sovereignty, which has been under threat since Russia invaded the country in 2014. But those major policy disagreements didn’t stop the US and Russia earlier this month, when the two countries agreed to extend the last remaining nuclear treaty between them for another five years. Though Secretary of State Tony Blinken released a statement praising the move, he also said that “we remain clear eyed about the challenges that Russia poses to the United States and the world.” “Even as we work with Russia to advance U.S. interests, so too will we work to hold Russia to account for adversarial actions as well as its human rights abuses, in close coordination with our allies and partners,” Blinken added. Biden’s isn’t a fully confrontational approach, then, but rather a transactional one. There are many things on which Washington disagrees with Beijing and Moscow — and Biden will let them know about it — but there are also some areas where the adversaries can work together. Biden doesn’t want to shut the door on making progress in those areas. It’s a fine message to send early on, but it’s also a tricky situation to navigate over the long term. Should China further antagonize Taiwan, or Russia launch more cyberattacks against the US, for example, Biden will have less room to pursue cooperation with those countries. The possibility for plunging ties remains. But UT Austin’s Greitens believes calls like the one Biden just had with Xi could help mitigate such problems. “Clarity on the strength and nature of US concerns is important to avoid misunderstanding,” she told me. “It’s best for the US and China to try to clearly delineate where they can cooperate, where it serves both countries’ interests, so that the cooperation is on a sound footing.”"

See Biden focused on domestic agenda in the first half of the year; in heavy counsel with ODNI, CIA and State on RU (and IR). Believe outreach to NATO allies on the RU question has already begun. Fast moving events in world hot spots may prompt 46 to meet with Putin sooner than later. From CNN article: 'But Russia -- a country with a nuclear arsenal rivaling that of the US -- can't simply be placed in the penalty box. Policy experts generally agree that the Russian government must play a role in responding to major world crises, from reining in Iran's nuclear ambitions to recently halting the brief, bloody war between Armenia and Azerbaijan.' CNN, 01/22/21, 'Putin presents a Russia-sized foreign-policy headache for Biden': https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/22/europe/putin-biden-foreign-policy-intl/index.html The Washington Post, 01/23/21, 'President Biden is starting on the right foot with Russia': https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/president-biden-is-starting-on-the-right-foot-with-russia/2021/01/22/3779340e-5ce1-11eb-b8bd-ee36b1cd18bf_story.html From Post article: 'The president also ordered an intelligence assessment on four nettlesome aspects of Russian behavior: the recent SolarWinds cyber breach, interference in the 2020 election, the use of chemical weapons against opposition leader Alexei Navalny and reports that Russia placed bounties on U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. The intelligence assessment will give Mr. Biden a chance to hold Mr. Putin and his government to account where necessary, and to protest in the strongest terms where appropriate. Each of these episodes demands a stronger U.S. response than Mr. Trump provided. In the case of Mr. Navalny, the question is not only the fate of the leading opposition figure who was target of an assassination attempt, but also Russia’s blatant disregard for an international treaty prohibiting the use of chemical weapons.'"

The international standing of USA remains weak as long as some national issues of USA will have not been resolved. Examples: The negotiations about national issues like stimulus bill and also the impeachment trail against his predecessor has higher priority as bilateral negotiations about issues for foreign affairs. I assume that by last quarter of 2021 President Biden will take his time to tackle foreign affairs issues because some of his secretaries will have closed its provisions on some foreign affairs issues.

The Russians were just linked to a major cyber security breach in the US, and the Democratic Party still believes Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election was a decisive factor in the outcome. It is also notable that Putin was one of the last world leaders to acknowledge Biden’s recent victory of President Trump. All of which leads me to believe there is very little political benefit for Biden to hold or attend a summit with President Putin. Additionally, this is just an extension of a treaty, so I do not think it warrants a summit. Thus far I have not been able to see any reporting indicating that either side expects or desires a summit.

Bush left office), but they became less frequent recently, with the last meeting between President Trump and Putin in 2018. So the macro trend would predict 4 or more years until the next meeting, but a heavier chance of occurrence in the first year of the new presidential term. More specifically, with recent relations between the countries further deteriorating due to the entrance of the Biden administration and accusations of Russian responsibility for the massive solar winds cyber breach, and with a global pandemic miring both counties in domestic health crises, it is less likely either President would be urgently seeking any kind of meeting or summit this year. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Russia–United_States_summits"

A chance that a meeting is ignored or not planned at all also seems low to me. Virtual meeting? Now there's a substantial NO resolution factor. With the COVID numbers going down or reaching stable rates early in the year and early in Biden's presidency, I see some reason to believe they will meet in person.
