In conjunction with the staggering overlap between SCOTUS and POTUS confidence, my first explanation would be that these are simply too technical and do not sufficiently enter into the rationalisations of the survey respondents.I would share my exploration in R, but am still just making baby steps into that and examining my data rather crudely."

Wade decision, the backlash against the leak certainly shows that some Americans consider it quite partisan and unfair. But on the other hand there is a possibility that it will not substantially affect the polling, many controversial rulings such as the 2000 election recount decision and the 2010 Citizens United case did not seem to affect Gallup polling at all. At least not right away. Interestingly, confidence in the court tracks with George W. Bush's decline in popularity. After Bush was elected the court did not see a year to year increase in confidence until Obama assumed office in 2009. It seems to me the polling indicates most people were not too bothered by the decision to end the recount, but as the controversies and gaffes of the Bush presidency accumulated Bush v. Gore became more significant to Americans. Confidence in the Supreme Court was already down in 2021, some Americans were already concerned that the court is stacked with a 6-3 conservative majority which is largely the result of Republican finagling in the Senate. If that court overturns Roe v. Wade it will sting in the minds of many Americans and just the leak itself has done damage."
