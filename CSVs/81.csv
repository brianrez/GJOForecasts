Covid 19 caused Sri Lanka great instability both economic and political. Many citizens of Sri Lanka saw President Rajapaksa as a scapegoat for all of their country's problems. The pressure continued to mount until President Rajapaksa resigned and President Wickremsinghe succeeded him."

He has a mandate from Parliament in terms of the number of votes he got, and he has the support of the ruling party. He has the political and economic experience to return the country to stability. If he can improve the economic situation in Sri Lanka, improve the supply of electricity, gas, food and other basic necessities, secure additional foreign financing (restructuring World Bank aid, getting new IMF aid, and potentially new aid from China), and improve Sri Lanka's economic trajectory, then I think he can hold onto power. And I think he will most likely be able to do that. He does not yet have the support of many protesters, but he is now clamping down on protests to restore order. He has raised the cost of protest, and that will most likely buy him enough time to stabilize things on the economic front. He may not be able to steer the country in a direction everyone likes or move fast enough, but I suspect he will be able to do enough to prevent further collapse in the short term."
