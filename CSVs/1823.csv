Over six years have passed since the beginning of the war and the US public position has remained unchanged. Therefore, I predict the US will never publicly endorse a peace plan that includes Assad. I surmise the US would privately be OK with Assad if he stabilized the country, pushed back ISIS and limited genocide."

It could be argued that the change is because of Syria's (alleged) use of nerve gas in the last week, but Syria has been using gas throughout the conflict, which did not stop the US and UK from suggesting that maybe peace, with Assad left in power was better than continued war. So it is not impossible that in a few weeks or months justification could again be found for leaving Assad in power in return for peace. At the moment this looks extremely unlikely before 1 July.

The military benefit of gassing must be fairly limited, even ignoring that many of those affected seem to have been civilians including children. The strategic affect is likely to be totally negative; normal people in most countries consider gassing people, particularly children a serious war crime, and so would pressure their governments to not treat with the Syrian Government and to demand that Assad his Government be removed. It is helpful in any war to have as much support as possible. Assad seems to not realise this. Russia might be wondering if covering up for Assad might make some Putin apologists wonder if anything Russia says can be trusted to be true. (Of course if an investigation were to prove that what Russia claimed was true and the gas was rebel stock then the PR might improve for Assad, but Russia is making believing what it says difficult because of all the fake news.)"

In terms of this question, an ""endorsement"" (a term without technical stipulation, or metric) could be anything from a stray Trump statement or tweet, or some pronouncement, either in formal or informal language or format from Tillerson or Haley, or any number of would-be spokespeople for the ""US."" -15 on the Trump restriction of freedom-of-action as to overt actions benefiting Russia, but still maintaining a reasonable possibility since a) Trump may express a desire to do so, even if such an actual outcome would be politically unattainable (which would still be an ""endorsement""), or any number of other US spokespeople might do likewise."

Such agreement would effectively be a gift to Assad, without any reciprocal advantage for the U.S. How ever any of the other criteria of this question may be defined, the use of the word ""endorse"" has to mean an explicit statement by the U.S. that it accepts Assad's continuation in office, and/or the legitimacy of his seeking national executive power in Syria if he is temporarily replaced by an interim regime. The United States would gain absolutely nothing by making such an endorsement. The U.S. might cooperate with the Assad regime against ISIS, but to do so, it need not make any explicit endorsement of his continuation in power, and Assad is in no position to demand such an endorsement as the price of his cooperation with the U.S. Assad will be perfectly happy with the U.S. keeping its mouth shut about whether he should stay or go, and the U.S. will be perfectly happy to refrain from any rhetoric that might impede its promised campaign against ISIS. What we will see in the next few months, even if the U.S. begins military action against ISIS in Syria, is American silence about the future of the Assad regime. If Assad or Putin has something to bargain with, Washington may be willing to entertain the idea, but Trump, while being careless, a neophyte, and something of a buffoon, is also a bargainer, and will not give away something for nothing. Right now there is nothing Trump will get in return for recognizing Assad, therefore I don't think that he'll do it."

There are the the western small parts controlled by Shia syrians which some of them are in favor of Asad. There is the northern part which is controlled by the Kurdish people and spread along the Turkish border along with the Islamic State group which is also in the east part and south east. This split area is like that since ages. Once the regime stopped controlling them by force and intimidation there is not a single way rather than brutal force to make them surrender and be under the ""heretic"" Asad as they think of him. This area was ""quite"" under Asad senior and Sadam just because they did it by force and intimidation. Once it's gone... the resolution for this area is 3 different states: Kurdish, Shia controlled, Sunni controlled."
14493,2017-02-12T12:03:50Z,6,[60.0],[60.0],"QJ Open is not issuing clarification on this question leaving it up to the best judgement of forecasters. The two extreme interpretations of this question are (a) that the US just announces that it will endorse a peace plan which allows Assad to remain in power without any other parties to the conflict having agree to the plan, and (b) that all combatant groups in the Syrian civil war agree a peace plan that includes a provision to allow Assad to remain in power and the US then announces that it will endorse this peace plan. It seems to me that (b) is so unlikely that it is not worth taking the time making a forecast. The number of combatant groups, overt and covert, are so numerous and cover so many extreme views that it will be impossible to ever get all of them to agree to anything. So I don't think that this is what QJ expected us to be forecasting. Interpretation (a) could be held to be true merely by the US producing its own plan which includes allowing Assad staying in power. If the US produces a ""peace plan"" than no other party accepts, it could be argued that it is not really a ""plan"" but a ""proposed plan"", which is possibly not what the GJ question intended. I propose that a more sensible interpretation of the question is that the ""peace plan"" needs to be a document that at least two of the major parties to the Syrian conflict are putting forward to a UN endorsed Peace Conference. Major parties include the UN, Arab League, Syrian Government, Turkey, Russia, Iran, USA, EU/UK, ISIS and other Syrian anti-government groups. I don't see that a ""peace plan"" requires that peace has been brought about. There are many conflicts that continue after some or most of the combatants have agreed a peace plan (e.g. Israel/Palestine Oslo peace plan in 1994 has not brought a total peace agreed by all parties, but the ""accord"" is still viewed as a ""peace plan"" in general sense.) Obviously other forecasters may disagree with my thoughts! As the Syrian Government, Russia and Iran already appear happy for Assad to remain in place, and the UK has indicated that it is willing to consider Assad remaining in place, what seems to missing is it being stated in a more formal peace plan and the US endorsing it. I think it is possible that the US could agree to do so before July."

I expect a plan has already been drafted by Russia, but with the turmoil of changeover I think it will be a couple of months at least before the US and Russia can jointly hammer out wording and take it to their regional partners, but that still leaves plenty of time before 1 July for a final peace plan to be proposed and formally endorsed by the US. The Trump administration might even try to fit it into the first 100 days, for symbolic purposes.

If by July 1 there's a plan that's widely endorsed (by the UN and EU, for example), Trump would probably jump on the bandwagon. The problem with that scenario is that since the EU considers Assad a war criminal, they would never agree to letting him remain in power. And if the EU agreed that he could remain in power as an interim figure, they would almost certainly not guarantee his immunity from prosecution after he left power, so Assad would never take such a deal anyway."
25875,2017-01-05T21:00:54Z,1,[20.0],[20.0],It is highly unlikely that the new administration will endorse a plan for Assad to stay in power unconditionally. The possibility of endorsing an election within this time frame is significant but it is more likely that that will involve an exit provision. The possibility of no endorsement within that window is also significant. The new administration appears to be more positively positioned towards Russia (who supports Assad) but any concession on the Syrian situation will not be automatic. Assad's support by Iran is an extra complicating factor.
32161,2017-01-05T20:40:11Z,1,[65.0],[65.0],It is likely that the discussions between Trump and Putin with regards to Syria will include the topic of a unified Syria. Due to Russia's support of Assad and Trumps belief that Assad is a better alternative than the rebels he will likely support a plan put forward that will include Assad remaining in power. Whether this plan will be outlined and endorsed before July 1st remains unclear as we do not know how much communication Russia and the US will have after Jan 20th

Donald Trump has replaced nearly every advisor he possibly can. There are two strong opposing factors, in my mind, at play here. The first is the simple fact that the US Government is not likely to change its position so quickly on such an intense topic. We are already invested billions into this conflict in supporting anti-ISIL forces that in most, if not all, cases are also anti-regime forces and to turn our back on the months of training and millions of dollars of equipment we have given them seems very unlikely. On the other hand, the opposing factor, in this case, is the simple fact that Donald Trump seems to do everything within his power to distance himself from the current US administration. On top of that, he is prone to doling out rash responses to questions or accusations. This factor becomes a much stronger player if, ""US endorse a peace plan"" means simply our president saying he thinks it's a good idea as opposed to the whole of government creating a plan to support and endorse an actual hashed out plan. My assessment on this one is quite arbitrary and after the couple glasses of wine I've had, I'm in no shape to get actual sources for my logical ramblings.

In Modamayeh in the Damascus suburbs, the reconciliation deal included the promise that “the city will become like paradise after the settlement and will be serviced with everything,” according to the regime. “In normal circumstances the process for the fighters is divided into three parts,” Samman explained. The first step is for combatants to stop fighting. Then the regime offers offer amnesty to secular rebels who aren’t under suspicion of committing war crimes. Islamist fighters supposedly get safe passage to Idlib. In recent years, the regime has extended 50,000 pardons, according to Samman. On a few occasions rebels have begun working alongside Al Assad’s police and army. They also get a government stipend of $50 a month. Displaced civilians from reconciled communities must go through a background check, after which the regime allows them to return to their homes. The real problem is for men between the ages of 18 and 25. Since 2011, the Syrian government has extended the standard, two-year military conscription to five years. A stop-loss policy is also in place — preventing, on an emergency basis, conscripts from leaving military service. The only way to avoid military service is to enroll in a school or university. Education in Syria is free, technically — but space in any given institution is limited. As a result, young men with money rush to register at one of Syria’s private schools. Thousands more young men simply leave the country to avoid conscription."

There is little optimism in Russia that there could be a serious reconciliation between Washington and Moscow, even if Donald Trump is in the White House. But if it happened, this is what Russian analysts say it would have to entail. By Fred Weir, Correspondent ... Trump told the New York Times last week that ""I have a different view on Syria than everybody else,"" which some understand to mean ending efforts at regime change in Syria and teaming up with Russia to combat the Islamic State. Such a deal might finally enable Russia and the US to jointly sponsor a permanent settlement for that long-suffering country."

First, under what conditions will there be a peace plan at all? Assad and the Russians want to beat Assad's enemies, not to make peace with them. If they achieve this objective, there will be no peace plan. So for a peace plan to appear, Assad and the rebels need to reach a stalemate. And If the US stops supporting the rebels, this looks less likely. Second, when would the US ""endorse"" such a plan? For this to happen, Islamist groups should be excluded (per Trump's statements that he wants to eliminate them). So the plan would involve some kind of settlement between Assad and the non-Islamic rebels, while leaving Islamists to be further attacked. Even if this is possible, there won't be peace - at least not until the Islamist groups are decisively defeated. If the plan manages to get through these two hurdles, the third one - leaving Assad in power - should be easy to meet. Trump is no ardent opponent of Assad, and if the Russians want him, Trump may think of extracting some concessions from them. Ditto for the July 1 deadline. To recap, resolving the question as Yes implies (i) a military stalemate between Assad and the moderate rebels, with (ii) the Islamic rebels defeated, and (iii) achieving this before July 1.

It is the right of every government to fight rebels who try to overthrow them, but with so many other countries, rebels were always backed by the US government and their partners. Putin's view of Syria and what is going on there is correct and the US and Russia will stand with Syria to defeat not only Isis but also the rebels."

1333,2016-11-12T19:18:43Z,3,[85.0],[30.0],"Raising from 55 to 85% after reviewing this article which applies to all Syria/Trump questions. Let’s not exaggerate Trump’s actual impact on the world. Amidst the eschatological angst, it is important at least to start by noting that — as every president has had to discover — he (and someday she) is just one person. Even an aligned Congress can act as a brake on some of the more lunatic or destructive policies, as will the very machinery of government. Besides, Trump gives little evidence of being details-oriented or having any clear sense of a vision, which will mean that he may well prove more willing to let the machine grind along, so long as he gets enough photo ops and adulatory mentions. Yes, there is no question that a Trump presidency will have serious, dangerous implications, but here the very framing of the US political system — designed, after all, to make executive power hard to apply — and his own limitations may be useful. It’s winter in Central Europe. Whether or not Trump actually means anything he said, especially his backpedalling from US commitments to the defence of NATO allies, nonetheless this must be a real concern in the Baltics and Central Europe. Ultimately, there is no reason to believe Russia has any territorial designs on NATO states, but it will, if it feels it has the chance, bully and intervene. More to the point, Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, even Belarus are going to have to come to terms with a future in which they are unlikely to be able to count on serious Western support and protection. Putin may have pushed for a Yalta 2.0 division of Europe, but this election essentially hands him the half of that deal he wanted, by default. The Kremlin’s glee must be tinged with a degree of nervousness. Nonetheless, the Russians never expected Trump to win, and their calculus was based on trying to ensure a Clinton presidency was weakened from the gate. Yes, Trump has been bizarrely positive about Putin and there is the possibility of a Putin-Berlusconi-type mutual man-crush as ageing, soi disant alpha males find fellow reinforcement in each other. But much of the Kremlin’s geopolitical playbook has been based on it being the unpredictable, risk-taking party, relying on the West to be the responsible adult, the force for stability and reason. Trump’s friendship is hardly an asset on which to rely, and his balance an even less stable foundation. The Kremlin might actually feel it has to be a little more cautious and predictable, precisely because it is dealing with someone who actually internalizes the kind of devil-may-care belligerence Putin affects. Syria will burn. Between Trump’s open desire to get some more bombs dropped, and his expressed willingness to deal with the Assad regime as a lesser evil to Islamic States, we can expect no push for peace and regime change in Syria. Eastern Aleppo may itself prove a harbinger of this war. History restarts, and democracy loses some of its force of appeal. The notion that the end of the Soviet idea in 1991 meant that history had ended and liberal democracy had won has long been debunked, but this is pretty much the final spadeful of earth on its coffin. It is unlikely that, for the moment, American democracy will have anything like the same power of example, just at the time when Europe is in a populism and legitimacy crisis of its own. The security concerns are global. Trump appears to be unconcerned with climate change — the single greatest global security threat — and almost relishing a more confrontational approach to geopolitics. I can hardly see him interested in development aid, or disaster relief, or humanitarian foreign politics in general; his basic calculus appears to be a short-termist profit maximization for USA Inc. This is bad for everyone, whether American or Zimbabwean, or from somewhere in between. Some hope at the bottom of Pandora’s box. There always needs to be some hope, but I confess this morning I am scrabbling around in the corners of this particular Pandora’s box to find any. It may galvanize Europe to be more serious in defending itself from overt and covert threats, no longer being able to count on the big brother across the ocean. At the very least hitting the 2% of GDP NATO target expenditure more consistently would be a plus."

Her priority, from what I can tell, is to eliminate the Islamic State in the region. This leads to another question is the elimination of the Islamic State going to help or hurt Assad's bargaining position? My best guess is that it will hurt him and turn the focus of the international community back on to him. He has skillfully, along with the help of his allies, used the Islamic State as cover to commit all kinds of atrocities and weaken opposition forces. Without that cover is it possible to imagine a world where a negotiated peace ends with Assad retaining power? I personally don't believe so."

But it does seem that this is a ""stacked deck"" question which requires a lot of things to happen before such an endorsement becomes plausible: 1. The war needs to end, and it's far from certain that a military peace can be achieved in the next eight months. 2. Relations between USA and Russia will need to be reevaluated so that any US endorsement doesn't seem like a submission. If it's going to happen, there will need to be concessions from the Russians so that America can at least appear to be getting what it always wanted 3. We don't know - with any certainty, at least - what the US political landscape will look like in two months time. 4. How will the Kurdish question be resolved? It will need to be, one way or another, or this whole damn thing will very quickly devolve into bloodshed again. From April, an article suggesting that Assad may be the Kurd's best hope of gaining some measure of autonomy in the region; something which NATO ally Turkey strongly opposes - https://sputniknews.com/politics/201604011037306955-turkey-kurds-assad-syria/ 5. What are the alternatives? It's one thing to get rid of an entrenched and influential leader, but quite another to find a suitable replacement. (*cough* Iraq) Will the US acquiesce if there's a better (read ""pliant"") alternative? 6. All this is contingent on Assad not being assassinated or slipping in the bath, and actually wanting to stay in power after the war."
