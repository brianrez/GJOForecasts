This would give the company a market cap of $31.8bn-35.1bn after the first day of trading. Historically, IPOs tend to outperform their valuation, due to underwriter incentives to underprice the stock and capture extra profit (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underpricing.asp), so on this basis, I would expect Robinhood's IPO to outperform its valuation by 15-20%, in line with historical norms (https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/trends-in-ipo-pops-2021-03-04). However, given Robinhood's unpopularity with the retail traders that will be making up 20-30% of its first-day shareholders, I would expect the ""IPO pop"" to be a bit more muted than normal, perhaps more around 10-15% (making the new first-day market cap in the $35bn-39bn range, approximately)."

I estimate there to be a 1% chance that Robinhood drops >21% on its first day of trading, reducing its market cap to less than $25. On the other end of things, I estimate there to be a 1% chance that Robinhood gains >28% on its first day of trading, which would increase its market cap to over $45B. In terms of trading above or below $35B, this is very difficult to predict so I estimate the chances of each at 50%.

However, the high volume of SPAC/IPO activity over the last few months have made certain aspects of this process more drawn-out and delayed the SEC's approval process, so I feel comfortable stating there's still a relatively significant chance Robinhood does not trade publicly before September, with now just two months to do so (https://www.etftrends.com/crypto-channel/robinhoods-ipo-review-slowed-down-at-the-sec/). My thought process over its valuation if or when it does IPO, though, remains relatively similar to before."

Standard deviation is large (39%) with fatter tails. The last bucket should then be about 45% (from now on, we are conditioning on the ipo happening).

Additionally, out of the 560 IPOs this year, only a handful have been delayed. Thus, I put the likelihood at 5%. Next, I found online that Robinhood was being valued around $20 billion last year. Given that the revenue from the first quarter projected for the next full year would be double this year, I would project that Robinhood's valuation would likely be at least $40 billion. Finally, I looked at previous IPOs in the last year, and on average for tech related companies, it seems like on average it seems to spike around 30-40% on IPO date. Thus, I predict around $50B for the IPO price, and made the rest of the distribution centered around there, with a fairly wide variance due to macro/market uncertainty and uncertainty on how much it will spike on the first day. It is likely more upward skewed as there were more instances of tech companies spiking on their first day, and looking at P/S ratios like Snowflake's after IPO seem to give evidence of a higher upside."

Given the general positive activity in IPOs recently, along with Robinhood's name recognition, there would likely be decent activity on its IPO, which may favor an uptick in market cap from initial valuation. This is partially countered by the possibility of retail activity in the other direction, given the firm's reputation post-meme stock, but I believe the former forces would outweigh the latter."

After that, the last previous benchmark value for Robinhood was $11.7 billion in a privately funded round last year, however this does not include the growth that Robinhood saw in the past year through the pandemic. There estimates that I saw tended to range around $20-40 billion with more recent articles tending to have higher predictions. Additionally, it seems as though Robinhood may trade some shares via direct listing. I think that this will increase the first day retail demand and result in a market share of a little over $40 billion. That being said, there is uncertainty in this amount, and lots of time until they go public which gave me my overall probabilities."

Forbes estimated that the broker was valued at $40 billion at the time of reporting (February 2021). With more than 20 million active users, Robinhood was able to generate $682 million in Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) and continues to generate revenue as retail investors flood to the markets. I predict that Robinhood will most likely end its first day of public trading with a market capitalization of anywhere between 35-55 billion dollars, conditional on Robinhood going public within the next six months. This would represent a forecast of anywhere between -13% to 38% of its most recent valuation by Forbes in February 2021. However, there is the case in which Robinhood will opt to delay going public, and raise more capital/revenue to going public. There is a possibility of this due to the fact that recently Robinhood has been under media scrutiny for recent events related to ""meme stocks"" and user backlash. Therefore, this must be priced into the distributive model as it is possible that Robinhood will not go public for a duration of time, and therefore also continue to grow its market cap. If Robinhood does decide to go public prior to September 1, 2021, then there also exists the black swan event in which the majority of market participants will decide to short sell Robinhood stock, therefore driving the price down and causing Robinhood's market cap to be less than 25 billion."

This suggests to me that the most likely outcome is the more than 55bn but not with any great confidence as the evidence is not so strong (just predictions of various commentators, some variability in what happens to companies' value in day after IPO generally, RH seems to have had some controversies suggesting something could go wrong in between now and the IPO, plus my own ignorance about such matters) so I'm hedging across the other outcomes."

The last two funding rounds seem to have happened at around a max payment of 30-33bn Annualising Dec estimated order flow revenue of 100m, would give 1.2bn, roughly the same as Interactive Broker's commission revenue which has a market cap of 30bn, which I will use as a proxy. So incorporating the latest cap raise, using IB as proxy, and also assuming Robinhood was much more active in Jan/Feb period this year, I will assume market annualises at 1.5bn, all of which would imply around a 38bn valuation Finally, between animal spirits, and a low initial float, even if it IPOs at my base of 38bn it could potentially close a 50-100% higher, as fundamentals don't seem to matter too much currently."

Its valuation was estimated at $40B as of Feb 2021. It's growth therefore seems to depend on stock market gains and consumer appetite rather that market awareness. (https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/robinhood-ipo/). Investors forecasts a prolonged growth market so it seems unlikely anything significant will shake novice investor confidence. The average pop for us listed first day IPO's is 44% (https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/19/investing/robinhood-ipo/index.html). Customer anger/ bad press seems almost irrelevant at this point. Other rumours put the ipo at $20B )https://marketrealist.com/p/robinhood-ipo-date/) but given the 44% upside that could easily close above $30B. It seems likely that current momentum indicates an IPO in May/June but if not then it could be delayed until fall.

That’s about double the proposed IPO valuation that Reuters reported in December, citing people familiar with the discussions. Robinhood was valued at $11.7 billion in its private fundraising round in September."" That's some crazy growth, and while Robinhood has indeed seen a huge boost to new users recently, I would think some of that valuation growth is due to speculation (especially with the SPY at new nominal highs, stimulus cheques coming soon, etc.). My answer also depends on when the IPO happens -- specifically, financial conditions at that time. Depending on who you believe, things are either fine or super iffy and liable to implode. So that will affect Robinhood's valuation (assuming they IPO at all) as their profitability depends heavily on active trading on the platform."
