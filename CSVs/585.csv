Quoting from https://popis2021.stat.gov.mk/Activities/THE-CENSUS-IS-COMING-TO-AN-END/ ""at 20:00 we will be able to announce that finally, after 20 years, the State Statistical Office has successfully carried out the largest statistical operation"". It is currently well past 20:00 in Macedonia so the announcement is late, but I expect it may still come in time for the resolution of this question as Macedonians will be up in the morning by then. This tweet (https://twitter.com/popis2021/status/1443634094320070663) may also count as some form of announcement: ""Huge thanks to everyone who participated in #Попис2021! Thank you to everyone who participated in the statistical operation and contributed to accurate data on our population!""."

I am going to assume that the completion of the census means the end of counting and the collation and analysis is a later date (obviously). The latter is intended to be complete by the end of 2021. The State Statistical Office appears to be confident is completing the headcount by September 30th, 2021. Objections will probably be raised by maligned parties although according to UK reports census data is outdated before it is published and therefore only indicative. Based on their optimism and possible political pressure, I will suggest completion by the due date."

102121,2021-09-27T20:24:43Z,1,[90.0],[90.0],"My prediction is based on the following factors. (i) The census is currently taking place and there is a belief that some of the problems associated with the 2011 census that was canceled have been mitigated e.g., political interference (https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2021/5/12/why-is-it-so-difficult-to-hold-a-census-in-north-macedonia), and some optimism that the census will be completed (https://balkaninsight.com/2021/09/24/north-macedonia-census-takers-rush-to-complete-head-count/). Things do seem to be going better than they were in 2011 as described by the article referenced in the question statement (https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/North-Macedonia/Census-fails-in-Macedonia-105372). (ii) Whether the problems have truly been mitigated may not matter too much. Even if there are still problems, because those in charge of completing the census believe these problems have been mitigated, they may still announce that they have completed the census. Issues about the census may simply occur later, such as when the results are published (and potentially challenged). (iii) The census may be completed before October 1st, but the announcement may only happen on the 1st of October (which is still a business day) or later. However, if the population is indeed in the 1.5-1.8m range, with 1.3m people registered as of the 24th at a rate of 100k people per day (https://balkaninsight.com/2021/09/24/north-macedonia-census-takers-rush-to-complete-head-count/) then everyone could be registered before the 30th of September with enough time to spare for an announcement that can be pre-drafted and published with a click. I do expect that the number of people registered per day might start falling as the registration rate increases, but It's hard to estimate by how much. (iv) I am not sure whether there is the possibility of a legal delay to the completion of the census as I have not been able to find a copy of the actual decree. That said, this has not come up in any articles I have seen on the topic so I suspect that there isn't."

Given the importance of their percentage of the population and their resultant rights plus the effect of the diaspora has created mistrust in the Government. The initial phase commenced in March in registering people who have emigrated and now reside in other countries. According to the Governments guidelines concerning the timeline of conducting a census, the original census in April was to be completed 21 days. The completion by October 1st of the census would now appear to be in doubt. It has to be carried out eventually given the 20 year gap, the need to allocate resources and the requisites to join the EU, but possibly taking a little longer."

Having trouble hiring census workers and applications still being accepted thru 8/25 originally scheduled to close 8/5. The enumeration was expected to start sept 5 and go to sept 30. I nad read it would take 3 weeks but they plan for 4. So with the delay in hiring workers and then tkme to get them trained it is going to be tight. I think if it doesn't start by sept 10 then it will not be completed by oct 1. So i will leave 10% that it gets done.

Consider also that the census workers have to be trained once they sign up, but I'm not sure how long that would take.

The main issue being the Macedonian majority and the ethnic Albanian minority that includes the diaspora that have emigrated in recent years where rights and privileges are tied to the community’s physical numbers. For instance, Arber Ademi who represents ethnic Albanians in the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) has threatened to discount the results if the Albanian count is less than 20%. Conversely, a higher count, opposition claims a higher number of ethnic Albanians will give them more rights. They are concerned the census will show a higher number of ethnic Albanians than previously estimated, which could give them more rights (which is where the diaspora count comes in)."

With the last census held 19 years ago — the previous attempt in 2011 was called off when it became mired in political infighting — no one knows exactly how many people live in North Macedonia. The government says they need an accurate count of the population to be able to draw up long-term development plans, not to mention provide facilities such as schools and medical care to the population efficiently.

Should absentee citizens be allowed to offer their data given that many (including families have vacated to Western Europe and if third parties are acting in proxy, is this valid? The second issue is the nature of the census and how the collected will be used. The Governments position is that the census is non-political, where the results will not affect the country’s constitution, but is refuted by the opposition that suspects political motives. ‘The Macedonian constitution provides for certain civil collective rights for ethnic communities when they represent over 20% of the population in a certain municipality or throughout the country’ The Albanian political parties are concerned by a loss of municipal rights if the census shows a figure of less than 20% due the absentees. North Macedonia has been implementing EU related reforms as a precursor to joining the European bloc and is showing progress in this regard including transparency in all governmental issues. This might help ease the frictions amongst the various ethnic segments of society. Fifty-Fifty at this point and under review."

Since it's been so long since I've done the census, obviously a census in such a small country it's not that important. So it's not like North Macedonia will stop functioning if this doesn't happen which means the opposition will have a lot of room to oppose this.
