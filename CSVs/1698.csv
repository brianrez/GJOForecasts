"Before 1 January 2018, will SpaceX successfully relaunch an orbital-class booster within 24 hours of booster landing?",2017-04-14T17:00:04Z,2018-01-01T07:59:04Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Technology'],708,654,296,237,"On 30 March 2017, SpaceX succesfully launched the first recycled orbital-class booster, marking the first time in the history of spaceflight that a single booster has been used on two separate missions (CNN, Ars Technica). Elon Musk has stated that his next goal is to turn the booster around for relaunch in 24 hours, a milestone he said could be accomplished before the end of the year (Reuters). A relaunch that occurs within 24 hours of the booster landing, where the second stage of the rocket in the relaunch reaches low Earth orbit, will resolve this question as ""Yes"", regardless of whether the orbital-class booster lands after the second launch.

It stands to reason that even if this time is halved with each subsequent iteration, no time is taken between iterations and nothing at all goes wrong, eight months is an insanely short amount of time to make such a huge reduction in a process that currently takes up a large fraction of eight months for a single iteration."
