Obviously, if a candidate dropped out some of their voters would go to Sanders, increasing his likelihood of getting a majority of delegates on Super Tuesday. However, some of those voters would also go to other candidates and if those voters pushed the candidate over the 15% threshold that would decrease the number of delegates Bernie would win. I think the first effect is much more important, especially because candidates will concentrate their efforts in specific states where they are most likely to succeed. Warren in MA, Klobuchar in Minnesota, Biden in the south, etc. As a result, I think all of these candidates staying in will make Sanders less likely to win the majority, though he will almost certainly gain a plurality."

If we add in Bloomberg's strategy of targeting moderates, I would not be surprised if both of them take delegates away from Biden. Sanders' supporters tend to be very loyal so I do not think they will lose many votes to the rest of the front runners. In the end, I think Bernie will take an early lead after Super Tuesday."
