But the House and Senate results are more impactful. The market moved in 2016 because republicans took the house and the tax cut was a shoe-in. 2012 market dropped on a contiued divided gov't with no hope of stimulus. In 2020 the FederalReserve is driving the market. It ain't going nowhere and ot ain't gonna stop. Markets know this. Markets know based on current projections the democrats will take pres and hojse and have a good shot at flippkng senate. That means a massive spending package and a covid 19 relief package and a tax increase. But the spending happens immediately and the tax increase is 16 months away. Maybe the senate doesn't flip. So we are back to a 2012 scenario wher McConnell will block everything the D's do. But unlike 2012 the Fed is still here. So no major drop. From @mwackers 2012 was a -4.02% drop. That is your downside. Wherever the market is on nov2. The maximum uoside potential is 7%. That is taking the first support at 3360 and assuming a big bounce to the oct high of 3580. To be hknest i do not believe the market will test the first support by nov 2. Since a 4% drop and 7% rise fit nicelyin the two bjckets that is where they be. I spread a little to the downside below 4%because 5 %is possible.

The question is targeting market reaction to the election but I don't think the market will have a strong reaction one way or another that persists over the next two weeks. And it can definitely fluctuate $140 over two weeks. I lean toward holding steady, but there's definitely a chance a Biden victory could make it jump upward, or a chance the weak economy makes it drop within the time period by coincidence."

I could have put the full 100% on bin two as well, maybe I'll adapt in that way if the stock market climbs too steeply ahead of the election. But for now, my main scenario is: / nervous markets ahead of the election, say, after the 3rd debate on 22 October 2020 (minus 6% between now and 30 October 2020 / nervous wait for Trumps ""acceptance speech"" NOT to occur (volatile trading between minus 8% (calculated from today's close) and minus 3% 02 November 2020 through 05 November 2020) / rally of relief, if the result is clear enough to declare 46 POTUS after 06 November 2020 (between +5% and +10% from 02 November 2020 close)"
