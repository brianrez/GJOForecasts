In case a ordinary law states absolute limits it would be quite likely that the constitutional court challenge the law (either because it's a substantial contradiction to the universal character of the right to ask for asylum or as a challenge of Article 1 since the asylum seekers would be objectified as pure number). In other words: There is a good chance that such kind of law is going to be declared as invalid by the constitutional court. It wouldn't make sense to try to pass such a law since it would provoke an open fight within the conservative party and the social democrats, especially since there is a good chance that this law won't exist for too long. In order to make such kind of ""threshold"" sustainable, it needs to be implemented in the constitution (and even that might not be possible). However, there is simply no two third majority in the two chambers of the parliament (neither in Bundestag nor in Bundesrat) to do so."

Priority will be given to those who have not tried to illegally enter the EU and the number is capped at 72,000.

German law requires that the next election should take place on a Sunday between 46-48 months after the assembly's first sitting. Since the current Bundestag first sat on 22 October 2013, the latest date for the next election is 22 October 2017 (a Sunday). The earliest date is 27 August 2017, the first Sunday after 22 August. Elections to the Bundestag (Parliament) can occur earlier if a motion of no confidence in the Chancellor is passed by the current parliament.

With an expected defeat for Merkel's CDU and new influx of refugees Merkel can elegantly bow to 'the will of the people' after March 13th. If it will be a limit on refugees or intensive border controls (mini-Schengen) I don't know, but I think the chances of a mini-Schengen are bigger than a European consensus over limiting and distributing refugees. Furthermore the chances that an arrangement will be made before the start of the Slovakian EU-presidency (July 1st) is likely. The Western European states want an arrangement under the flag of the current (Dutch) EU-presidency. Prime-minister Rutte stressed last month that one of the main ambitions of the Dutch presidency is to settle the refugee crisis before this summer (in fact in 6-8 weeks)."

For now I think one of the most relevant factors is the timing of the local, state and national elections. According to this site: http://www.wahlrecht.de/termine.htm the next national elections do not occur until Fall of 2017. There are local elections and state elections in the meantime but I am unclear how much influence they will have on national politics. Clearly I am assuming that Merkel's position is central to any actual change. I need to investigate her relationship to her party and her coalition partners in order to better predict what may move her. In general she is someone who is careful and empirical in her judgements. She also brings to this issue several kinds of legitimacy which matter in a German leader: she has a PhD in physics, she was born in the West but raised in the East after her father who was a Lutheran pastor accepted a position in the DDR. These biographical details matter, I think, because she has both an ethical and empirical manner in her approach to politics which I think is strongly influencing her approach to the matter of refugees and asylum seekers. Her decision to radically welcome Syrians and others surprised me given how unyielding she had been in the negotiations with the Greeks. I suspect she may now wish she had been more reserved in her judgement but nonetheless, I expect that she will expend considerable social and political capital to avoid utterly retracting her position. While there are factors that could push her and her partners to make some changes in the next six months (I need to do a great deal more reading on this before I can calculate probable behavior) the counterweight will be the relationship Germany has with Turkey, concerns about the rising number of casualties in the Syrian war and international attention which is not flagging. I'm also relatively certain that she will not respond to pressure from the far right. Indeed the more the far right protests, especially in places that were once the DDR, the more I would expect her to resist calls to limit the total number of refugees Germany will accept. I do expect that there will be more changes about the types of refugees or the locations from whence they may come but that has already happened. I look forward to reading comments from others on this topic."
