I think an EDIS is a good idea, but there is zero chance of an agreement to set one up before 1 Apr 2017. It seems pretty clear that voters who assume that the deposits in banks in their country are safe don't want to subsidise what they see as high risk bank deposits in other countries that might not be able bail out deposits. (Banks is some ""safe"" countries might be a higher risk than the voters think, but the voters are right to believe that the ""safe"" countries do have national balance sheets that could bail out depositors). Another complication is that an EDIS could be for only banks in the Euro Zone or for all banks in the EU. It would seem very unlikely that post Brexit vote an EDIS that included the UK would be proposed. The actual question concerns not the EU Commission or EU Council of Ministers, but only the EU Parliament. The EU Parliament has already published the list of matters than it intends to work on over the remainder of this year, and there is no mention (that I can see) of an EDIS. We know that French elections will be coming up early in 2017, followed a few months later by German elections. I can't think why France, Germany, the UK, Ireland, Netherlands, any Nordic country or most of the Eastern European countries would be keen to vote for an EDIS in the next 8 months. I could see Greek, Italian and maybe Portuguese MEPs wanting an EDIS, but not a majority of MEPs.
