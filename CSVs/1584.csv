However, in the past decade (2007-2016) this rate was elevated with 71 out of 120 months or approximately 60%. Since the elections in 2009 months in which occurred were clearly more common compared to the previous years on record (70%). With the median number of months per year in which riots occurred being 8 between 2009 and 2016, in only one year since 2009, there were riots in less than half of all months (the current count is 4 according to ACLED data). Overall, 70% seems be a reasonably conservative base rate."

Elections increased the rate of riots and protests in 2014 so when looking for the mean I wanted to exclude riots and protests directly tied to the election cycle because Mozambique held elections in 2014. My question was how often do riots and protests occur that aren't about politics? How often do they occur when they are about politics? And what is the base rate of riots and protests per month?"

The reported causes were for disputes over wages for loggers, sugar cane mill workers, and staff bonuses at a university, and, the far more serious reports of police shootings that led to deaths and riots. For those caused by the police not to occur, it would require a major concerted police training program with emphasis on both crowd control and the appropriate use of force. Even if immediately implemented and with strong departmental and political backing plus strong civil and NGO watch groups, this would require months to accomplish. The labor wage issue could easily go on for months as well based on the gap that exists between management and workers. For these reasons, both protests and riots could easily break out in October. I am giving ""easily break out"" a 94% probability of happening. In addition, there are real tensions between the political opposition parties such as the Frelimo, MDM, and Renamo that could also lead to protests or riots."
