Biden needs someone who can campaign (hint: not Rice). Harris and Whitmer are both strong campaigners. Whitmer would help in midWest. Harris doesn’t bring ant states in (California as Democrat as you can get) but does have the charisma and diversity the Dems want to showcase and maybe drive some enthusiasm for voting. Considering American politics so stratified - only 16% of votes really up for grabs - Biden would be well advised to have someone who can pull voters in across country. So I’m going heavy on Harris. Harris’ background is more diverse than average American realizes...(half Indian via mother, black via Jamaican father, high school in Canada, strong-willed)... she checks all the boxes and is more impressive than Sleepy Ole Joe is."

Kamala Harris has the name recognition and the experience to be selected as VP, but she may turn off Middle America, especially the evangelical vote. I think strategically for Biden, he already won the votes of people who claim anybody (you know, any functional adult) is better than Trump. So maybe Harris isn't the best, but she is a woman of color, and that does give her some more value as a vp contender. It is crazy to me to talk of race as something of value to Biden, but we live in a world that minorities (I am a minority) want to be represented in one of the highest offices in the country (and I will be glad when that happens). We also live in a country where Christianity is basically a cornerstone, so those values need to be there, somehow exemplified in a vp candidate. Trump is going to play the card that Biden is not Christian, even though he is Catholic (and many Christians falsely see Catholics as not Christian til this day). Really, hate formulating this forecasr based on demographics but a majority of American votes seem to be persuaded more on race and religious values than merit."

Her name recognition is key for me here, and with both being African-American women with similar views and history with Biden, it seems unlikely Biden would pick anyone other than Harris. That being said, the length of the process and its recent elongation adds more doubt than I initially forecasted (hence the shift) and could be explained any number of ways in favor of both women. Really, I think it's going to come down to the pragmatic choice of Harris because she is fresh in voters minds, she endorsed Biden when he needed it, and she is a proven fighter in the Senate."

I've bet big on ""Another Woman"" until now & now think I may be wrong. Listened yesterday to 538's podcast about how each VP candidate would be discussed in the media -- they weren't forecasting the pick but you could read some tea leaves in the analysis. What struck me most was how much the ""Other Woman"" category is basically just Rice. Sure, Demmings and Bottoms are still in the discussion but it's basically Harris vs Rice vs maybe Duckworth at this point. At least that's how I see it."

The conventional wisdom is that a presidential hopeful chooses his running mate before the general election race begins. Then again, conventional wisdom would also limit one to picking a man as his vice president and that is clearly not the situation we are in now. Despite this being such an unusual point in election history, where a nominee for president has publicly committed himself to choose and a woman and probably an African American one to fill the VP spot, I think many of the standard political considerations still hold true. And those assumptions are what I am going to use to establish my base rates."

Her run for President exposed some organizational flaws that remain hard to overlook. She raised copious amounts of money, but spent it all before the voting began. And in victory, Washington would have both a President and a President-in-Waiting. Harris is definitely young enough to consider another race; her behavior indicates she would put that first over what she owed to Biden. I worry that Harris did not do well in her interview, or that she might not have passed her background check with flying colors. My personal choice would be Bass, but I could also see why Mr. Biden would want Susan Rice (four of their eight years under Obama were spent with each other). He has already mentioned on several occasions how important this personal relationship will be to him. Is Harris someone he can trust? I wouldn't trust her! But I would Bass and Rice."

For the latter, because I think the pick is very likely to be risk-averse and Duckworth seems like the politically safest option to me (Senator, decorated veteran, relatively moderate). Biden ran an extremely risk-averse campaign in the primary, seems to be doing that again now, and is currently in a commanding lead in the polls."

But I fear her past experience is running contrary to a lot of the BLM movement. Warren would help cement the left of the party. AOC's victory is showing that the progressive left is not a fluke. Risking Warren's seat in the senate is a consideration, of course. But I think as the BLM movement evolves, it will merge even further into covid issues and become an economic ""rigged system"" issue overall, which Warren would dominate. People are saying that Trump would have a field day with her, but I disagree. She is as tough as they come, and I think people would find him foolish trying to battle her on intelligence. If she was black, I would % her higher."

I think Biden will backtrack, say he had some great woman in mind who just couldn't serve for her own reasons (Michelle Obama), and pick a charismatic young guy from a Midwestern or Southern state.

Many Biden allies and members of the Black Caucus are pushing for Stacy Abrams, Keisha Lance Bottoms, or Val Demmings. However, all these female African American lawmakers lack experience, name recognition, and national campaign experience which are all things that Kamala Harris has. Campaign experience was a big reason Barrak Obama chose Biden, and I suspect Biden will follow the same logic. Additionally, Kamal Harris has some lefty appeal, she did co-sponsor Medicare for all back in the day, even if some of her old stances as a prosecutor, like criminalizing Truancy, have made her enemies on the left. However I don't think Biden will weigh these as campaign flaws as he is more of an old fashioned politician who has worse stances on criminal justice. I think Kamal is a favorite, but not quite against the field because there is a lot of ambiguity and this will come down to Biden's preferences. Also, Kamal has come out strong in defense of Biden following Tara Reade."

Democrats especially in this election are counting on minorities and marginalized people to get to the polls and vote, and one way Biden has done that before is with Obama. This makes me feel as if Biden can't pass up a runback like that and will most likely choose a woman of color. Stacey Abrahams unlike the other women on the list, has been very outspoken about her willingness and excitement to potentially be chosen as VP, She even almost seems to be trying to pressure the campaign into choosing her which although underhanded seems to be working."

I'm basing that on the fact that there are hundreds, if not over a thousand, female politicians who may meet the criteria for a VP. This is especially poignant when adds to the list prominent republican women, such as Jenean Hampton of Kentucky, who would represent a unity ticket with the explicit goal of beating the incumbent. If Hampton didn't have close ties to the Tea Party, I'd say either her or someone in a similar position were the most likely candidate. Of those who are commonly spoken about, I give Tammy Duckworth the highest odds at 20%. She would check a lot of boxes for a lot constituencies the Biden campaign likely wants to placate. She is from a Midwestern state with a Democratic governor who would appoint a democrat to her seat should she become the VP. She's generally progressive but not to a point where she would become a political liability any more so than Joe Biden himself already is. Stacey Abrams comes in at 16% because she would similarly check a lot of boxes, particularly with the black voters who have propelled Biden to the nomination. The only reason her and Duckworth don't have equal odds is her general lack of experience in elected office. My guess is that the Biden campaign, regardless of who the pick, is assuming that the VP has higher probability of actually becoming president due to Biden's age when entering office. As a result, they are in all likelihood prioritizing government experience over many other factors. Which leads to Gretchen Whitmer at 15%. Whitmer would be a solid pick because of her executive experience however, the fact that she is white and that there was a large amount of dialogue about the primary eventually narrowing down to an effectively all white field works against her potential as a VP pick. On top of that, Michigan has faded from blue to purple over the last election cycles and with the difficult policy decisions related COVID-19 she will have to make, it's likely that Whitmer's favorability will begin to decline in the coming months. Next up we have Biden's former primary opponents. I find it unlikely he will pick a VP from the list of other presidential candidates during the 2020 cycle. Amy Klobochar has better odds than Harris or Warren because she at least did not openly attack Biden in ways that received lots of coverage. She was also not at any point a front runner in the campaign. On top of that, Warren and Harris would both highlight the inconsistent speech patterns of Biden and the last thing the Biden campaign wants is to make their candidate look weak. All that said, i think there is a non-negligible possibility that the Biden campaign picks someone who is not a woman, particularly when one considers that broad range of viable options who are also people of color. I understand Biden made that promise but it would not shock me if they reneged on that promise."

Stacy Abrams would probably fit in on a Biden team well enough, but against the other women candidates the next biggest box she checks off is the appeal to black voters. Biden does well with that demographic already, owing to 8 years working side-by-side with President Obama, who will be leaving the sidelines to endorse him very soon, so the added value to the ticket maybe isn't there. Likewise, Duckworth is a veteran, and that never hurts, but her home state of Illinois, where she's best known, is not a going concern for the Biden campaign. Warren might be the best prepared to be a useful contributor to a future Biden administration, and if that were to occur she may find herself headed for a cabinet-level position, but she is still just too liberal to be on this ticket, which will inevitably be designed to appeal more broadly across the middle of the ideological spectrum. Of all the former Democratic presidential candidates, Warren was the most feared by Wall street, and the Biden campaign can't afford to lose any Big-money liberal support. Kamala Harris is bringing money to the table herself, with fundraising help and there's lots of money to be raised in her home state of California. But if she's the VP, then she can't be Biden's AG, and with her background as AG of California, that is ultimately probably her best fit in a Biden administration. That leaves Klobuchar and Whitmer. Both bring their popularity in a vital battleground to the table. Minnesota (narrowly won by Clinton in '16) for Klobuchar, and Michigan (narrowly won by Trump in '16) for Whitmer. Klobuchar would be the more traditional pick here, but Whitmer's status has been greatly elevated by her management and actions during the Covid-19 illness crisis occurring in her state and for her willingness to go toe-to-toe with Trump when it came to fighting for her state. Whitmer is still a lesser known quantity on the national stage, but her surging popularity in Michigan could move that state into much more of a sure thing for the Democratic ticket in the fall."
