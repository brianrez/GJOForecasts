The U.S. jet downed the Syrian plane after it dropped bombs near fighters from the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, the coalition's main ally in the fight against the Islamic State.

The only reply I received was that the examples provided a ""non-exhaustive list of what could count,"" which was extremely unhelpful. This means that I must clarify my interpretation of GJP's cryptic use of ""downed"" here. Seeing that the Jordanian, Bahraini, Moroccan, and Saudi aircraft in the Gulf News example were lost due to mechanical or pilot errors, it is clear that this will count as long as the warplanes were actively participating in an operation. This significantly broadens the field, but there is no clarification if a warplane is counted as ""downed"" while on a training or routine flight, which will skew results. I will continue with the definition as ""downed on operation"" (including error and mechanical failure) and later discuss training accidents."
