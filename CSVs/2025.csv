Yet it is important to consider that this construction project has not exactly been timely—in July 2012 it was announced that the expansion project had fallen six months behind schedule and was to open in April 2015 (the original scheduled opening date was October 2014). By the time September 2014 rolled around, the canal was expected to opened, and I quote, “at the beginning of 2016.” Clearly the canal is not yet ready and we are well past the “beginning” of 2016. The President of Panama said that he anticipated the expansion of the canal to be complete around May. Therefore by observing past trends of consistent overconfidence of how long the project will take, we can safely assume that the Panama Cana will not be open to shipping before May."

Those tests are not currently scheduled to begin until April, putting the canal opening into late June or early July.

However, “Jorge Quijano head of the Panama Canal is still confident of a second quarter opening and no later than June 2016” [1]. BOYD schedules ships for the Panama Canal on their website a month in advance [1]. An objective assessment for a 15 May 2016 expanded Canal open will have greater predictability by mid April. The expanded canal will open. Nevertheless, what will be the catalyst to open before 15 May 2016? Expanded shipping lane demand may not necessarily be forecasted based on worldmaritimenews comments, “Shipping Confidence Continues Downward Trend” [2]. “OOCL Asia-Europe revenue slumps 32.2%” [3]. Additionally, depressed oil prices offer alternative transports more attractive. A brief look at DOW transports indicates a breakdown in technical patterns on daily, weekly and monthly charts. Contractual obligations may be one of the few incentives for a 15 May 2016 open. Culturally, Panamanians have less emphasis towards timelines, however, I’m not sure how this will influence the completion date of the canal [4]. I might have an improved forecast mañana.
