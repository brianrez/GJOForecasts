Time is due and no change still. On the other hand, when Governor Cuomo was in office, it seems there were reminders about a toll increase late in the year - November or December ish. This tells me it's still not too late. Further, you have the NJ Turnpike having just announced toll increases. If the 2023 tolls have not been announced yet, I presume it would soon as they have been pretty good at getting ahead before the new year comes about modified tolls. It seems the trend is to increase the tolls, which is consistent with ""congestion"" news and the general concept that people are traveling more for not only the holidays but also because we are getting out of COVID."

Non-operating revenues, including several federal grant awards, are expected to become a larger portion of pledged funds supporting debt service over the next several fiscal periods. Downside risks consider a longer than expected recovery phase over the next two to three years, thus pressuring PANYNJ to utilize a greater level on borrowings than previously estimated to support its multi-year capital plan, inclusive of both senior and subordinate borrowings."

74864,2022-02-22T14:42:30Z,1,[97.0],[97.0],"The port authority is a self-funded organization that has lost considerable revenue during the pandemic, while inflation has increased. Based on PA's documentation leading up to the rate increase that went into effect on 1/1/21, they have adopted an indexing method that increases rates when the ""cumulative impact of CPI"" exceeds $1.00. Additional details to this are not provided, such as whether they are weighing the impact across the multiple types of vehicles (cash for a car is $16, or 6.25% threshold, however for this I've assumed they meant the basic cash price of a 'car' (vehicle with two-axles, single rear wheels). This is important since the cumulative CPI % that equates to a $1.00 increase is very dependent on the current toll cost."
104682,2022-02-22T12:38:03Z,1,[95.0],[95.0],"The PA indicated on their website FAQ section that the latest toll increase (September 2019 decision, placed into effect January 2020) was due to cumulative monetary inflation since 2015 passing the PA's established threshold amount of $1.00 when applied to the cash toll rate. Furthermore, this increase was described as ""automatic"". The present cash toll rate is $16.00, therefore to trigger the automatic $1.00 increase, the threshold inflation since September 2019 would have to exceed 6.25%. As of February 2022 the cumulative inflation exceeded 7.5%. Therefore, unless the PA is compelled by NJ/NY state governments to delay the price hike, it is near certain (95%) the PA will announce a price increase before Jan 1 2023, most likely in September 2022 if the previous price hike is any indication."
