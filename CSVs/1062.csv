Labour's polls are climbing a bit, though not nearly enough, it's clear, to win outright, and somewhat to my surprise, the Liberal Democrats' support seems to have peaked. The surprise is a function of the apparent widening of 'Brexit was wrong' vs 'Brexit was right' split in the Yougov poll on the question, and the Lib Dems' fairly quick rise over the last six months, to the point of eclipsing Labour as recently as October. https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/11/12/political-trackers-11-12-nov-update. It seems I'm missing something there. But even in the event of a Labour or Lib Dem surge, a hung parliament seems the most likely positive outcome for them, and Jo Swinson has ruled out a coalition. That could change, of course, but as of now, I'm seeing that the odds favour Johnson and the Tories pretty strongly.

The UK is currently divided after the Brexit vote with a majority (albeit a slim one) voting in favor of leaving the EU. Aside from the intricacies of the problems with Brexit itself, the main issue at this point is that some parties are pushing hard for delays or in the case of the Lib Dems a reversal in Brexit altogether. It is likely that this will turn into a referendum on which party best represents the ""political will of the people""."

Likewise LibDems are unlikely to enter coalition with the tories on the basis of previous experience and radically different brexit policy.

With the LIbDem/SNP proposal to pass a bill to set aside the FTPA and call a GE for 9th Dec, Corbyn (Labour) will be in a difficult position. If he supports an election most of his MPs will be unhappy because their leader Corbyn is so unpopular that the Labour Party will almost certainly lose a lot a seats. Corbyn himself would then be under pressure to resign as leader. If Corbyn does not support a GE, but the Conservatives supported the LibDems/SNP proposal or create their own version of the proposal, either way a GE could happen if Corbyn wants it or not. For several months the LibDems have been trying to get Corbyn to agree to calling a vote of No Confidence in BJ, with a view to replacing BJ as PM by a caretaker PM, by a back bencher who is trusted by most MPs, whose only job would be to try to sort out Brexit by setting up a People's Vote. This plan has failed because Corbyn has insisted that he himself should be caretaker PM, but many of the MPs who would be happy to get rid of BJ would not support replacing BJ with Corbyn. Now, faced with a GE that his MPs don't want it is possible that Corbyn might be willing to go for a No Confidence Vote in BJ to replace him with someone like Ken Clarke (who was thrown out of the Conservatives) or a back bench Labour MP as PM. There are complications in this plan, but it could allow a caretaker PM try and get a People's Vote on Brexit. Its a log shot, but not impossible.

A GE (according to the BBC) needs a gap of at least 5 weeks between the date it is called and the date it is held because Parliament needs to be closed for 25 working days. A GE will not take place in Christmas week, and a GE in the week before that would be very unpopular. By my calculation the earliest GE possible if it were called today would be 28th Nov. In order to call a GE today parliament would need to vote with 2/3 MPs supporting the plan. This seems very unlikely as that would require Labour to support the plan, and Labour has said they will not support a GE before A50 has been extended. I take this to mean they would not vote for a GE before 1st Nov. (In case BJ managed to somehow cancel any extension offered or the EU failed to offer the extension.) Its also unlikely that Labour would want Parliament closed in the next two or three weeks.) So I think that only leaves the week in which 12 December is in, which a GE could be fitted in."

It doesn't seem likely that he will die or resign. At present Labour and the Lib Dems are reluctant to have a vote of no confidence as they want to ensure that there is no risk of no deal first and also they are not in agreement upon who would be a caretaker PM. If a caretaker PM can be agreed upon then they could press on with a vote of no confidence next week. A caretaker PM would be likely to be an experienced Conservative or Labour MP. It is unlikely that non-Labour MPs would support JC. If no caretaker PM can be agreed upon there would be a general election which could take place before Jan. However BJ may well remain PM if there is a GE. The important factor I think is whether a caretaker PM can be agreed upon by all the remain-leaning parties and independents. If so, BJ will be out by 1 Jan, if not, then he is likely to remain as PM until after the deadline."

The queen's assent to another prorogue is not guaranteed (at least not to me) --- and her refusal would carry great symbolism. Watching the September House of Commons maneuverings gave me the sense that what holds back a no-confidence vote is who would serve as caretaker PM. Corbyn seems to have no runway. So it would likely be a rogue Conservative who could get his party and enough splinter votes for a majority. The PM had campaigned for hard Brexit in the absence of a renegotiated withdrawal agreement. He has since floated the idea of refusing to ask for A50 extension as Oct 31 approaches. This would be in the face of recent law that mandates the PM to ask the EU for the extension. I've also now read about a conflict of interest investigation underway re: Jennifer Arcuri and some sponsorship/grants she or her company is said to have received while the PM was mayor of London. And then there are the unverified accounts of a personal relationship she may have also had with the then-mayor of London.

Not that he is a man of principle but Boris can't go back on his promise to leave the bloc. Since he doesn't have the support of parliament he will try and leave the EU through other means such as letting the October '19 extension expire. If he thinks that parliament, the EU, or the UK supreme court won't let this happen then he will call a general election. In the probable case of a general election there will be a hung parliament and the Brexit party will have garnered the most votes and can probably form a coalition with Boris' Conservatives. Maybe the Lib Dems and Labour can form an anti-Brexit coalition but that's very unlikely since Corbyn's Labour campaign will flip flop between being anti-Brexit and being pro-softBrexit, lacking a rallying cry. The desperation of one last attempt to thwart Brexit (which splits votes between Labour, Lib Dems, Green, and Conservatives) will lose to the annoyance and anger of politicians' indecision (mostly voting for the Brexit party and some for Labour), moving the dial Right towards Nigel Farage."
