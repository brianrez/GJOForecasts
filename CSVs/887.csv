There are issues with costs and infrastructure, but China can get round that, and Europe is investing heavily in fast-charging and production, slowly creating a more competitive market. Finally the % will depend on non-EV sales and I think these will not spring back as quickly as NEVs post-pandemic (during-pandemic?)."

I think growth prospects are very good for electric cars, but since the overall market was down and I would guess people who are relatively better off primarily purchase electric vehicles, it makes me think 2020 might have been an outlier. When the regular vehicle market picks back up it might put downward pressure on the share of the market that is electric vehicles. That said I still expect it to grow, but I just think we might be reading a bit too much into the 2020 data point. However I am hedging upward a bit as the crowd here leans higher and the superforecasters have pretty high predictions for 2021. Also the Ford Lightning makes me think this could grow quite a bit in the next few years as it seems to be breaking into the mainstream."

The COVID-19 pandemic now offers a unique opportunity for EV automakers to capitalize on new vehicle sales; many ICE automakers have suffered with shutdowns that might make things harder to bounce back from and more difficult to pivot from ICE to EV, opening the door to new and exciting disruptors (not just Tesla, but look at Lucid, Karma and others hitting the market now too). Additionally, people are starting to see and feel the impact of lower emissions during the pandemic; this will have a swift and wide impact on the appeal of EVs, with many apartment complexes now using solar panels on the roof to generate electricity and offering EV chargers in the building, so you don't need to own a garage / driveway to own an EV anymore. With the Millennial generation entering mid-life, with a stronger green agenda as a cohort they're more likely to opt for EV's, especially as pricing, styling and options become more comparable to ICE. The economic recovery will impact this, positively or negatively, but I like to think that forward-thinking governments will now offer even more enticing incentives for individuals, corporation and government entities to purchase EVs. Similarly, with Gen Z more likely to use Uber than have a drivers license, many public authorities will be incentivizing commercial fleets to invest in EVs to reduce carbon emissions, maybe even charging more for ICE vehicles in cities (London's congestion charge being considered in NYC is an example), further generating rapid growth in the EV market. Commercial vehicle sales of EVs will also soar, with brands like Arrival taking market share for delivery vehicles and buses. Organizations like Amazon will lead the way, purchasing EVs to reduce emissions and claim lucrative tax breaks. Range anxiety is one current issue, but who ever needs to travel more than 300 miles in one go regularly? We're seeing Tesla now selling their second vehicles to early adopter EV owners, most of which now opt for the smaller (cheaper) battery back with less range; therefore that trend indicates that range anxiety will become a thing of the past in time. I would opt for a higher %, as I'm optimistic that non-ICE cars will sell many more units in the 2020's, but the reality is that it might be more like 2024 before we see the critical mass tipping point, due to the ongoing pandemic and economic devastation, and I'm also intrigued by Hydrogen Fuel Cell technology, which will likely make a dent in the overall non-ICE market."

All big car companies are building for an electric future of their business and will introduce many more models until 2022, as they need to get their expected ROI they will market these vehicles more aggressively in the coming years. Although global economic recession triggered by the current corona virus crisis might make a dent in EV car sales, as their price is generally higher, though the price difference should equalize further until 2022. I also thought about a network effect of new charging infrastracture, making EVs more attractive. Also, the more people own one and see it isn't a huge difference from ICE vehicles, the more others will consider buying an EV."

Off-putting factors could be the relatively high purchase costs, reduced grants, weaker economies, and Governments less keen to subsidise while moving through a recession. But this could transition during 2021-22 with the return of grants, combined with improved battery technologies offering faster charging and longer range. Also the network of fast-charging points should have time to develop offering more encouragement to switch across. My feeling is that a small % increase next year will turn into to a bigger increase through 2022, perhaps more in line with the 50% year-on-year increase from 2017-19. At a guess that could be 3.0% for 2021, then 4.5-6% 2022."
