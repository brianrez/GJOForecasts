I'm curious to register my intuitive scores before analysing in greater detail, after which I'm sure my allocations will change significantly. Russia are not going so 0%. GB and other countries are outsiders, and thus receive outsider percentages. Then it is close between China and US, with the former nosing marginally ahead. China only seriously compete on the world sporting stage in the Olympics, hence their best athletes go into Olympic sports (unlike in the US). In addition, we are 8 years on from Beijing when many young aspiring athletes were sold a dream to compete (I was in China during that time - it was powerful!). Add those two elements to a sizeable population and the pedigree should be impressive."

Additionally, I've assumed that country's medals are won independently of each other, when in reality, as a country wins a gold medal, it prevents another country from getting that medal. This is to simplify the analysis, but I think the final point remains the same: this should be a pretty straightforward ""win"" for the US."
