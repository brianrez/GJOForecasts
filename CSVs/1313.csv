"Between 1 July 2018 and 30 June 2019, will an armed group from Ethiopia engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Ethiopia?",2018-06-27T17:00:15Z,2018-10-01T06:59:15Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],69,654,39,237,"The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (The EWP). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 30 September 2018 and will be resolved in July 2019 after EWP assesses the situation in Ethiopia from July 2018 to June 2019. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilians fatalities occur in one or more campaigns. See (EWP) for examples. See (GJOpen) for GJâ€™s FAQ on forecasting questions like this.",https://www.gjopen.com/questions/977-between-1-july-2018-and-30-june-2019-will-an-armed-group-from-ethiopia-engage-in-a-campaign-that-systematically-kills-1-000-or-more-civilians-in-ethiopia

In combination with the most recent outbreak of violence occurring in August of this year, and the tension between Prime Minister of Ethiopia and the regional authorities it is likely that there will be more violence. The accusations of Human Rights violations in the form of secret jails inform my prediction that a campaign could systematically kill 1000 or more Ethiopians, however since general violence or violence that happens in different regions will not count toward the 1000 figure I have set my percentage low not because I don't think there will be more violence but only because I am unsure if the violence will meet the current parameters listed above. Here are a few sources I consulted. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/04/report-669-killed-ethiopia-violence-august-170418164259637.html https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-politics/unrest-spreads-in-eastern-ethiopia-after-deployment-of-troops-idUSKBN1KP0FI https://www.news24.com/Africa/News/civilians-killed-thousands-displaced-in-eastern-ethiopia-20180806"
