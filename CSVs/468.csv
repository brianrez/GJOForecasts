Cleveland Jewish News, 07/20/21, 'Is Hamas now firing rockets from Lebanon?': https://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/jns/is-hamas-now-firing-rockets-from-lebanon/article_6e9700d9-b8b5-5446-a503-bcdbf370146d.html Clips from News article: “Hamas looked for a response to the Temple Mount tensions, but it isn’t interested in firing from Gaza. Hence, it was easier to do this from Lebanon—with Hezbollah’s coordination,” said Maj. (res.) Tal Beeri, director of the research department at the Alma research center, which analyzes security threats to Israel emanating from Syria and Lebanon. According to Beeri, a former IDF intelligence officer specializing in the Lebanese and Syrian arenas, Hamas chose to fire from Lebanon for a number of reasons. The first is that it has not been able to recover from the May conflict with Israel and did not want to draw Israeli fire towards Gaza. Hamas correctly assessed that Israel’s retaliation in Lebanon would be significantly smaller in scale that in Gaza, said Beeri. The Iraqi Qataib Hezbollah militia announced that it had joined the “regional equation” in June in the latest sign of a coordinated Iranian-led axis of radical entities operating against Israel. Hamas in Gaza and Hamas in Lebanon tightly coordinate their activities, mainly through the terror organization’s headquarters in Turkey, according to Beeri. A branch of that headquarters, known as the “Construction Bureau,” is responsible for arming Hamas in Lebanon and ensuring that it has its own ability to activate weaponry. It appears as if Hamas’s gamble was well-calculated, judging by Israel’s restrained reaction. Israel also seems reluctant to respond more forcefully in Lebanon at a time when the country is experiencing severe economic and humanitarian crises—basically, sitting at the brink of collapse. A broader strategic consideration is Hamas’s desire to implement, albeit symbolically, a new “equation,” announced by Hezbollah, according to which any perceived Israeli offensive activity near the Temple Mount will be answered with attacks. Beeri noted that in recent weeks, Iranian-backed Iraqi militias and Houthis in Yemen have pledged their allegiance to this same equation.'"

Hamas is a puppet organization of radical/violent Islamists based out of Iran. (I remember watching Hamas throwing political rivals off of rooftops while alive.) So Israel is not dealing with a sane organization. In one day, one week, one year or in one decade, the current cease fire will end and violence/fighting will resume. There is far too much hate, mistrust and anger for a peaceful solution anytime soon!"

Another point is that both were characterized by a couple of incidents which one or other side could have claimed was a violation of the ceasefire (eg small rocket attacks) but I could find no evidence that they did. Even in 2021 there has been one incident that could have been a ceasefire violation ""Gaza militants sent several incendiary balloons into Israel, causing 26 fires, and Israeli aircraft struck military posts in Gaza"" but there appears to have been no public accusations. I started off thinking accusations of ceasefire violations are more likely than actual violations but in fact it looks now like a less likely event in that minor violations may be be pragmatically overlooked to maintain the ceasefire. So given this I'm estimating that the ceasefire won't be broken within the time window, would have made probability even lower but for the fact that there still appears to be a pending case in the Israeli Supreme court of evictions from Sheikh Jarrah and Hamas has said that it would resume rocket attacks if the evictions go ahead. That appears to be a likely outcome but I can find no recent information beyond early June on what has happened to this case and I'm not putting huge weight on the earlier Hamas declaration which was now some time ago. So going for 35% for now based mostly on 2008 and 2014 information."

The Hamas will be experienced enough in diplomatic language not to fall prey to a premature reaction, and the recently inaugurated Israeli government will not want to start their term with a major escalation of the conflict or a diplomatic fauxpas or being seen as the sole responsible side in a failure of the opportunity the ceasefire offers, allthemore an Arabic-Israeli party joined the new coalition, which could lead to a more moderate, more humble treatment of the Palestinian cause based on a better understanding of the Palestinian view (which is indeed very optimistic) or the threat of an early destabilization of the newly formed government."

This appears to be a political move rather than the need to replenish the weaponry. Hamas is supported by Erdogan in Turkey and receives rocket hardware and technology from Iran. Israeli Intelligence agencies estimates that the Hamas arsenal contains many thousands of rockets. Biden has committed to the replenishment of Israel’s Iron Dome in the meantime; although Israel’s overwhelming forces could cope, the Iron Dome being the protection of citizens. The destruction of Gaza’s infrastructure and the death of 2000 people may have provided the need to take stock of the rocket assault on Israel; noting that the ceasefire is not time limited. The attempted eviction of Palestinians, in East Jerusalem, from their homes that provoked this latest outbreak has been appealed to the Israeli Supreme court. Their ruling has been postponed form May until later in the year, but the issues between Palestinian residents and Israeli settlers have not gone away and will rise again either way. Israel courts have a history of ruling on the side of the settlers based on claims of Jewish ownership prior to the creation of Israel. The potential fall of Netanyahu and a new Israeli government based on a coalition of eight political parties from hard right to left wing and including the Arab Islamic party, Raam (who only have in common being the desire to get rid of Netanyahu) will possibly have little effect on the Palestinians. Ahmad Aweidah, the former head of the Palestinian stock exchange suggests that whoever is the Israeli Leader will make little difference to Palestinians as the majority of Israeli political parties have the same ideology. The current situation suggest that the ceasefire will hold until, at least 22July 2021 with both sides wary of accusing the other side of violating it given the sensitivity and fragility of the situation. The forthcoming ruling(s) by Israeli Supreme court will possibly be pivotal as to when a new outbreak will occur."

Moses Hess, friend and co-worker of Karl Marx, in 1862 declaring a Jewish State to be a necessity for humanity. In 1881 Leo Pinsker in response to the Russian pogroms appealed to Western European Jews to assist in the formation of a Jewish colony in Palestine. Theodor Herzl produced a pamphlet in 1896 called the Jewish State and became the driver, organiser, propagandist behind the Zionist movement. In 1917 the Balfour Declaration was the public pledge by Britain to establish a national home for the Jewish people as included in the terms of the British Mandate for Palestine as a result of the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire post WW1. The pledge did include a caveat that ‘ ‘nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine’ although the mandate was set up to facilitate self-rule by the Jewish people. The horrors of Nazi Germany in WW2 cemented the need for a safe homeland for the Jewish people and wars and conflicts have occurred during the life of the establishment of Israel."
