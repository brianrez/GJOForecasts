Third, non-tangibles such as testing, tracing, and treatment are taken into account. The US has not yet developed a universal testing and/or tracing plan, and treatments are no more developed than they were several months ago. As such, the US does not qualify for any of the requirements listed, and while they are beginning to decrease national cases, it will be months before they reduce cases enough to hit the second mark and will likely take at least as long to develop the needed non-tangibles to qualify.

After August, the incentive to open the border for toursim will be lower. However, the number of potential travelers will also be smaller, making a control of arriving travelers easier to implement at that time.

Travelers who can prove they are free of the virus, or submit to tests and a minimum quarantine might be welcome. We should leave room to consider advances in viral detection/treatment."
