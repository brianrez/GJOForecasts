At that time, North Korea's leader was Kim Jong Il, who died Dec. 17, 2011. Is it possible that with his passing, lethal attacks on South Korea have fallen out of favor? Another problem with this forecast: the base rate since Kim Jong Un came to ""power"" (I doubt all that ""dictator"" talk about him) has been hard for me to calculate because of too few lethal incidents. If my analysis is correct, nowadays North Korea is being ruled by a large committee of seriously geriatric generals, with Kim Jong Un as figurehead, all of whom are corrupt and want themselves and their heirs to survive the Trump administration."

Sometimes I try to figure out what opposing parties seem to see as their BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement). It seems to me that the NK BATNA is clear: keep building more missiles and nuclear weapons no matter what. At the same time, the US doesn't seem to have a clear idea of its BATNA. One possible option for the US might be to deploy as many ABM sites as possible, with the idea of shooting down NK missile launches. Although the record of successful shoot-downs has improved over the years, ABM technical challenges do not assure 100% success. Also US ABM success seems to have been with short and medium range situations, not ICBM. In the medium term, the likelihood of success for this defense strategy will deteriorate. It will be overwhelmed by the building of hundreds of missiles and the eventual application of MIRV capability. I think the true BATNA for the US is to accept the inevitability of a second Korean War, and to make preparations to win it decisively and quickly in the near term, while that can still be done. I don't think that this understanding will be reached in the next month or two, I'm also betting that NK will not act immediately. Apparently they still have a little work to do to perfect their reentry heat shields."

This round is different its the US and UN that have increased sanctions on NK (so NK has been provoked), There is some suspicion of possible fake news about the suggestion that NK might have miniaturized a nuclear bomb so that it would fit in the ICBM it has been developing. This same story or something very similar has been reported earlier this year, last year and regularly since 2013. So it is not really news today. Maybe it is politically convenient to make a lot of noise about it now? It is not believed that NK has the capability to start a nuclear war with the continental USA. (No evidence a NK ICBM can get through re-entry). The thing Kim wants is to have the capability to hit the continental USA with a nuclear bomb. Next best is for the USA to believe he has that capability. He does not seem any risk of being overthrown (as far as I can tell). Provoking an incident that is not part of tests to get his nuclear ICBMs working would not seem to be useful to him. On the other hand Trump might be tempted to show NK how much ""fire and fury"" the US has, but the US military probably has sense to take more care."

As one commenter pointed out, Kim Jung-un is not the lunatic that Western media portrays. It would be disastrous for everyone if a shooting war started - especially with nuclear weapons in the mix. The question is worded in such a way that one may think a brief exchange of gunfire between South and North Korea will result in a few deaths. The more likely scenario is some incident quickly leads to an escalation and the gloves come off. In the ensuing conflict, many will die. Until things cool down, it is not unreasonable to expect the emergence of a serious conflict. We have to remember that the U.S. administration is woefully inexperienced in this type of situation. And, quite frankly, the administration is over its head in most issues related to geopolitics."

I would anticipate a DPRK nuclear test before October. The US has not been able to stop these tests with cyberwarfare (if that has indeed been the case with the missile tests - still unconfirmed). DPRK has in the past randomly shelled the ROK. Nothing convincing yet suggests the ROK or US is committed to abandoning caution and will provoke the DPRK. The Trump administration has so far walked back many Presidential tweets/campaign pledges on foreign policy. The discrepancy between the prob for Apr-Jun and Jul-Sep periods is purely due to the date today. We also got through the Easter weekend DPRK parade without incident. The high numbers reflect the apparent red line drawn by the administration, especially the statement that the US has 'lost strategic patience' with the DPRK. All evidence suggests that the current admin will value the use of the military and intends to contrast itself with any perceived weakness of the Obama administration."

He knows that the US does not dare to use nuclear weapons against him, nor does China. He knows that China, the US and SK are aware that NK could attack SK with conventional weapons which could kill thousands of people. Although China could beat NK in a war, China is afraid that NK might go down fighting and take SK with it, leaving China to pick up the pieces. If SK were attacked it could no doubt hit back, but at a high cost. All this means that retaliation by China, USA or SK to provocation by NK has to be very carefully balanced; too little and they appear weak; too much and they risk an escalation by NK. As Kim does not care if a few of his subjects are killed he is quite capable to taking some action that results in a small number of South Koreans being killed (e.g. sinking a fishing boat or two, shelling boarder guards) and daring SK (or the US) to hit back. If they do not hit back Kim would count that as a glorious victory, if they do hit back as a tit for tat action Kim can use it as propaganda in NK to prove that NK is surrounded by countries that are planning to attack NK. Experience has shown that SK and the US have no real answer to this sort of action by NK. The number of border incidence has reduced as the provocations of atomic bomb tests and missile tests has increased, but that does not mean that NK could not go back to shelling, torpedoing ships, planting land mines and just shooting people if it feels it need to make point. With the US sending ships towards NK and the THAAD system on its way, NK may decide to do something."

There was also the sinking of the ROKS Cheonan, which was blamed on a N. Korean torpedo, although there isn't enough evidence to support that claim. Outside of these events, I am not aware of any other major confrontations. Currently, there do not seem to be any major arms build-up or mobilizations occurring that could indicate a potential conflict. That being said, the overall situation in the South/East China Sea region is quite rickety, and a misstep by any of the neighbouring nations (Japan, China etc.) could set off a conflict within S. Korea as well. I do not believe such an event will occur in 2017; neither army is likely to be prepared to wage a war, and the threats of casualties and massive political destabilization are likely to prevent an escalation from happening right now."

Of utmost importance is maintaining, for its people, a semblance of national strength in the face of challenges from the outside, and therefore any provocation--a fly-over or a sail-by--by other nations must have a response, and the nation must continue with its own shows of military power. I think that the military build-up is largely symbolic. However, NK has to be careful not to go too far. The UN, U.S. and other partners have just recently slapped them with the toughest sanctions applied to any country in decades for their brazenness. Aside from sanctions, NK also relies heavily on aid from other countries, including South Korea. So they will not want to do anything that will provoke these countries to retract that aid. The DPRK's power seems to be somewhat fragile, and it relies on a balance of economic prosperity and military might, among other things. It doesn't want to rock the boat too much. Moreover, the DPRK is not interested in outright warfare. They know that they U.S. and others would intervene."
