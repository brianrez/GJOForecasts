Given the gap since the last change (31 October 2019), the probability on 31 October of a change happening by 29 January 2020 was about 75% (based on past distribution of rate changes). However, given that most of that 90 day window has passed without a change, the probability, now, of a change happening by 29 January is reduced. I've fudged the estimate by bumping ""same"" by 10% and dropping ""lower"" by the same amount. I could make the estimate more explicit but I really must get to work... :-)"

Given the current trend, I get the most likely change as a decrease, with a slight chance of an increase.
