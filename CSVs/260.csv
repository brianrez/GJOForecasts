In fact, according to CNN, a UN envoy for Iran has stated that the nuclear deal is 'not even on the agenda.' Further, Iran's providing Russia with armed drones as reported by The Guardian may complicate things further. Then we have the technicality of having the deal be effective. If a deal is reached, it takes time to draft the official agreement. Then the agreement has to take effect on a certain date, and at this point the most logical time is the first day of 2023, which would resolve this question NO. I leave an extra percentage point or two to acknowledge the fact that it takes the average deal approximately 26 months to complete, which this renegotiation is soon approaching. There are also possibilities that conditions materialize that the deal could be used as leverage for something else."

Therefore, 50-50 split but with so many issues going on (Russia's threat on Ukraine, midterm elections), JCPOA will not be a priority."

All they had to do was lower sanctions and at that time I'm confident Iran would have rejoined the original agreement. However the Biden administration took the same position as the Trump administration that the original deal was not acceptable and used the sanctions as leverage to try to get additional concessions such as restrictions on missiles. Which is disingenuous because the Biden negotiating team has many of the same people that negotiated the original deal under Obama.
