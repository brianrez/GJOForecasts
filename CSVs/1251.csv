Epsy likely gained some Republican votes following Hyde-Smith's racist comments. In 2016 Trump took the state by 16 points. It is likely that a combination of Hyde-Smith's personal unpopularity and the already witnessed blue swing in previous Republican strongholds indicates that she will lose several points but still come out ahead of the Democratic candidate. She will not win because the state's approval rating for Trump remains at 56% and he has spent time campaigning on her behalf."

That said, runoffs don't get massive turnout, and this favors the party that attracts more retired white people. Plus, it's Mississippi, so our ol' Bayesian prior is pretty deep red."

First, Hyde-Smith garnered 41.5% of the vote, while her Democratic competitor, Mike Espy (D) won only 40.6% (https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/live-updates/midterms/midterm-election-updates/mississippi-senate-race-heads-to-runoff/) Second, Republican State Senator Chris McDaniel (R) received 16.5% of the vote. It is rational to conclude that the majority of McDaniel's voters will back Hyde-Smith in the special election runoff, rather than electing a Democratic Senator (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/12/mississippi-senate-race-cindy-hyde-smith-faces-mike-espy-in-runoff.html). Third, President Trump's approval rating in Mississippi is significantly high at 59% compared to a mere 36% unapproval rating. Therefore, it is rational to conclude that Mississippi voters will select Hyde-Smith, a candidate who will be more likely to support President Trump's policies and agenda. Fourth, President Trump announced that he will hold a rally in Mississippi on the eve of the election, in which, more likely than not, he will bolster support for Hyde-Smith by directing his supporters to elect her (https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/14/trump-mississippi-visit-hyde-smith-hanging-remark-990602). Lastly, despite controversy surrounding Hyde-Smith's recent statements, it is unlikely that Mississippi voters will elect a Democratic Senator to represent their state, as the last time a Democratic Senator was elected in Mississippi was 1982 (https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/416761-hyde-smiths-public-hanging-joke-shakes-up-mississippi-runoff)."
