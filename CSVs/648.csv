Of the 5 remaining games for the 4-7 Washington Football Team, only 1 is a very likely loss (Steelers). The games against the 49ers, Seahawks, Eagles, and Panthers are all possible wins. Perhaps the most pressing reason for updating this forecast is the fact that WAS in now in a good position to win the terrible NFC East (translation: They will be very motivated at the end of a long season when the last place teams like the 9ers and Panthers are cashing in their chips).

Their upcoming schedule is gruesome on paper, but their next game is against Pittsburgh, who despite being undefeated, will have an unconventional week due to their delay in the Ravens game. The following week they play at San Francisco, which has been moved to Arizona due to COVID restrictions in Santa Clara county, effectively making it a neutral field game against two comparable teams record-wise. They host the Seahawks, which will most likely be a tough opponent. The last two games of the season include hosting Carolina and at Philadelphia. As long as they stay in contention for the division title, they will have motivation to play and play well. It is looking more and more possible that 5 wins is very attainable for the WFT and so I am drastically increasing my forecast based on their recent play."

While it is likely that Washington wins at least one of the remaining 5 games, the fact that the two weakest opponents are last on the schedule will mean that Washington's morale will be at a low point in the season with little on the line.

They need to pull out 2 more victories out of their remaining 6 games to reach a total of 5. This upcoming week, they face Dallas on Thanksgiving, a game where the Cowboys traditionally show up and play decent. The Cowboys are coming off a big win at Minnesota as well as a strong showing the week before against the undefeated Steelers. I still project that the WFT will lose this game, meaning they will need 2 in their last 5. Washington's next three opponents are at Pitt, at San Fran, and hosting Seattle. They should not be favored in any of these games, although San Francisco is reeling due to their injuries, but may potentially have their top QB and TE back by the time they play WFT. The last two games of the season involve Carolina and Philly - arguably, WFT will be underdogs for both of these games, but it depends on what direction Carolina and Philly take in terms of personnel and who they decide to play. Overall, this Dallas game on Thursday is a huge swing game for the WFT. If they can win, 5 wins is somewhat feasible. If not, it looks very daunting.

It is feasible that the WFT beats the Bengals, as they are a only 1.5 point favorite where home field advantage in the NFL typically provides a team 3 points on the spread. Early betting action is coming in mainly on the Bengals, showing the Vegas sharps believing that to be not only good value, but favoring the Bengals. Beyond this week, the schedule looks daunting for WFT. They played a banged up Dallas team, but on Thanksgiving, where the Cowboys traditionally put up a good game on the national stage. Following that game, they have very tough road games at Pittsburgh and San Francisco before hosting the high-octane Seahawks and the resurgent Carolina Panthers. The last game of the season is against the Eagles, who may need a win for the division title so, by all accounts, the last game of the season should include both teams' starters.

Though better than their 5-0 start record, this does not bode well for a prospect of 5 wins this year. However, the past decade of records results in a win percentage average of 39.7%. A regression to the mean would suggest that this year's record would be better than last year's.

In order to reach five regular season wins, they would need to win three of the remaining 8 (or two wins and two ties). It is likely they will achieve this because, of the remaining 8 games, they are playing the Cowboys and Eagles again, two teams they have previously beaten this season. Also, the Panthers and Lions, as future opponents, are last in their respective divisions. It seems likely that Washington will win at least 4 of the remaining games, so winning at least 3 seems quite likely."

Luck and individual variation of previous matchups must be accounted for in the final forecast, mitigating the gap between the previous 25% win rate and the necessary 38% win rate. Overall, I speculate there is slightly less than an even chance this will occur."

Of their final eight games, they are due to play one team who is currently undefeated. So far, Washington has won 25% of their games and would need to win three out of seven games (42%) (excluding an expected loss to the ladder-leading Steelers). Accordingly, I rate their probability as very low."

Based on their remaining games' strength of schedule, they only face one team with a winning percentage over .500 (SEA). I forecast that WAS has a 60% chance to win three more games to reach a total of 5 wins. Contributing context: - Injuries: Dak Prescott (DAL QB), Matthew Stafford (DET QB) - Facing Rookie QB against CIN - Weak Conference: Still in the hunt to make playoffs; incentivized to win - Week 17: If PHI clinches playoff berth, they could possibly rest starters in the matchup."

Their only divisional loss was by 3 points. The NFC East is an extremely weak division. Their non-conference schedule is not as easy, but offers some winnable games. If they win 2 of 3 divisional games in the second half of the year, they need only win one non-divisional game to hit the 5 win threshold. The unpredictability of late-season games thanks to playoff stakeholders and weather makes this increasingly likely."
