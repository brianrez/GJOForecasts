The first fact to note is that PM David Cameron has promised to hold a referendum on the UK's membership in the EU (a.k.a. Brexit[1]) before the end of 2017. (Both the Economist[2] and the BBC[3] have impeccable overviews.) How likely is it that Cameron will follow through on his promise? Pretty likely, I think. I'd be willing to make about a 100-to-1 bet in favor but not much lower, so let's say there's a 99% chance that there referendum will be held by the end of 2017. For the moment, I'm going to ignore this possibility, but I'll factor it back into the mix later. And I think it's safe to assume that the date for the vote would have to be announced no later than the end of September 2017. It's now (roughly) half of the way through February, so in order for Britain to set a date for the Brexit vote before the end of 2017, it has to do so in the remaining 19.5 months. Assuming that the date on which the Brexit vote is set is randomly determined, the probability of that Britain will set a date prior to May 1, 2016 is 1.0-(17/19.5) = 0.128. Why? Per the above, I'm assuming that our probability space is made up of the following discrete outcomes:"

He wants to avoid blame and failure not actually achieve something. Staying is the relatively blame free option and he would take this at any time if he could. He doesn't trust the British public to vote to stay in so he wants to avoid a vote under his premiership. Immigration problems will continue for the foreseeable future and Cameron is scared the public see this as the last straw. Cameron will avoid a vote at all costs even to the end of his premiership. If one takes place and we vote for Brexit Cameron will fudge the issue so we don't leave until after his premiership ends."

Anecdotally, referendum dates may not be announced quickly in many cases (government can be slow). Obviously, the EU summit outcomes in Feb. and March will have a big influence on my prediction. Given his confidence, how long this is an issue, and that the vote needs to happen before the end of 2017 (and there are EU political reasons to have it sooner rather than later, such as elections in other countries politicizing their potential responses to British negotiations), I believe there is currently a 67% likelihood."

15001,2016-01-17T11:50:24Z,1,[25.0],[25.0],The key to setting a date for a referendum before May 1st is to get an agreement in the February negotiations. If a deal is struck in Feb the likelihood of a date announcement before May is probably over 90%. The question is can they get a deal that gives Cameron enough leverage to go to the people? Europe is notoriously bad at making decisions as we've seen in the last few years. The standard procedure in recent years has been to go right to the cliffs edge before making any unpalatable decisions. These negotiations are incredibly complex. Britain is looking for fundamental changes to the EU project. Any deal will have to be strong enough to carry the day in a referendum but also not leave egg on the face of the other member states. That seems like a tall order to me. Cameron has said that a referendum will occur before the end of 2017. I think Europe and Britain will take a couple of bites of the apple before getting to a deal that can be sold. We shall see in February but for now I'm keeping faith in Europe's ability to dither. One chance in three that a deal is struck with additional risks of member parliaments not agreeing.

Cameron is going to press for these reforms/changes at the next EU meeting Feb 18/19 and, if necessary, at the leaders' summit in mid-March. A key demand Cameron is proposing is to restrict non-British EU citizens from accessing certain benefits during their first four years in the country; this proposal has not been well-received by some EU members."

The date should be set 3-6 months prior to give change for ""stay in"" to have time to make case. The ""stay in"" campaign has started with the scare mongering about economic outlook by Osborn. The wheels are in motion, so likely timing is September 2016 with an announcement in Q2."

While little apparent progress has been made on the negotiations for EU-UK treaty revisions and opt-outs, the upcoming election cycle in the UK (5 May 2016) and national elections in France and Germany in early-mid 2017 mean that the most probable window for a referendum would be mid- to late-2016, and an announcement prior to the UK local elections would likely benefit the current government (Conservative). If no substantive progress is reported towards additional UK opt-outs or exemptions from EU treaties, or if conditions in the EU change dramatically (economically or otherwise), I could see the government making a case to postpone the referendum until late 2017 or even 2018, though that could lead to losses at the local election level for several years."

I'd set a 35% chance the referendum will take place in 2016, so adjusting 35% for 5/12 of the year means 14.58% chance of a vote before May 2016. Since the forecast scale does not allow decimal place, I rounded it up at 15%. My forecast will be subject to changes due to summit outcomes and shifts in UK sentiments about Brexit"

Furthermore, the agreement on immigration and welfare limitations he's seeking is unlikely to be consented to, and is probably the lynch-pin of his 'stay' campaign. As a result, his political investment in business and wealth generation is likely to come into conflict with those who share his views on EU migrants' claiming of benefits and therefore he will have to wait until a time when the political climate is 'right' before announcing a date."

I see now this question just asks whether they will set a date by 1 May (which would be the case if there were a June referendum)/ The EU referendum law has just passed through the House of Lords so will become law very soon. Cameron has leaned toward giving the people a voice ""as soon as possible"", though what he wants is for the EU to agree to many of his demands by February and then for the people to vote to stay in the EU. Would be messy if the EU balks in February and the vote is held in June (which is why a June referendum is still just barely above a 50/50 shot in my view)"

It does seem the argument for an earlier referendum due to the potential for another exodus of refugees i the summer of 2016 to the EU could be compelling, putting Mr. Cameron between a rock (poor negotiation results) and a hard place (daily headlines of refugees arriving in the EU and hoping to make it to the UK)."

There is no negotiation whatsoever, and there is little chance that he could ambush the other 27 governments with a last-moment deal, the way he did it to Scots. I am still above 50% because he has to organize that referendum, and five months may be enough for him to admit his inability to negotiate. With or without renegotiation, British voters include a 40% fraction who will vote for EU membership, and the business interests may sway just enough of the swing voters to keep Britain in. He'll say he did his part, the public decided to stay in, it's not his fault etc. In this scenario, it all depends on what the polls say about EU membership in the absence of renegotiation. Currently, ""in"" vote is at 40% and decreasing. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum#2015 )"

As a reference, the Scotland independence referendum took place on September 18th 2014, while the date was announced on March 21st 2013, so 18 monhts ahead. With these very rough assumptions, I would see the date to be announced in March 2016.

If the incoming Dutch leadership of the EU is indeed sympathetic towards the UK's request for reforms, then the UK would be well advised to use this positive vibe before it wanes. This again suggests a 2016 date. If September is the preferred month (being after the long parliamentary recess), then an announcement to that effect by end-April would give a lead of less than 20 weeks. However, referenda are very popular cans to kick down the street. If talks with the EU don't work out exactly as hoped (which they rarely do) then adding another year to the lead time is a decent cop out. With 3 summits in early 2016 and a 5 month gap between the June and October meetings, it is likely that any unresolved issues along the way will take the negotiations into June before a decision is considered, even re a September referendum. Hence I would probably lean towards a decision in late June 2016 or beyond rather than 1/5/16. In fact if Cameron wants a September referendum, is there any mileage in announcing it (or necessity to announce it) prior to the last summit before the recess? I think probably not."

He'll probably wait till the local body elections in May are over (unless of course he thinks confirming the referendum would help the Tories in those elections).

Now he has to sort out the age voting issue (@einsteinjs) and get agreement on the actual question. He may well be happy to have the 16/17s in, as they are believed to be for what he wants (i.e in EU), so that may not be an issue to him personally, albeit he may use this to delay the announcement if he is still negotiating for what he wants with EU/own party MPs.

Cameron's announcement of a referendum is a populist move to gather support and to improve its negotiating position to defend its special conditions it has received in the past, which are actually not justified except that the UK perceives it self as a ""Special Nation"", similar to US. It has basically black mailed the rest of the EU several years ago, which wanted to have UK in their ranks. Also, it has nothing to do with the various terror threats which the NATO states have brought upon them self by following blindly the US policies in Middle East after the fall of the USSR. To deal with this issue a rather broad cooperation is needed. The proper move would be to strengthen the sovereignty of the EU and to follow its own interests instead of those of USA or any other major player. Russia and EU will approach each other again, not because of Putin - as most of the Western Media wants to teach us, but because of Russia - just look at it on the map, their economical, cultural, and military weight and the prediction will come automatically."

However, once it's done, it's done. Once a referendum has been held, regardless of the results, they can no longer threaten to hold a referendum on EU membership. Consequently, I think it's probably as much bluster as substance. Plus, factor in the recent attacks on Paris and the growing ""circle the wagons"" mentality emerging in Europe and I think a ""let's go it alone"" pitch becomes harder to sell.
