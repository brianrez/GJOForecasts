I remember the 70s, and for sure there are similarities. ""What we’re experiencing now is a lot more like 1947 than like 1979,"" wrote economist Paul Krugman a couple of days ago. See https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/opinion/inflation-history.html. "" ... the bond market is, in effect, predicting a temporary bump in inflation, not a permanent rise."" So extreme monetary policy, i.e., quantitative easing, can end without pushing up 30-year rates. But we are very near the boundary between bins 2 and 3, and a good argument can be made for either one. The crowd is at 50/50, which seems about right."

Too much uncertainty or just two big possibilities that is either inflation will continue to surge and Fed needs to rapidly end taper or inflation is temporary and will settle for over next 3 months and so Fed cannot taper too quickly. Arguments are strong for either outcome and since this the start of a new phase data is short. This is one of those times when you need to position for either event.
