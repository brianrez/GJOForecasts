FOMC is the big one (likely why this question is asked and dated the way it is). I think an rate hike is expected and likely priced in already, although the tax reform bill did show a drop in gold prices. The core question is if the price will pass the $1235 marker. Quant analysis shows a downward trend. A higher 10year treasury yield has a negative correlation to gold prices. The spread between the spot price now and the bottom threshold is 1%. A few other notes in my thinking. I think retail sales will under perform, however we won't know for sure until after the cutoff date for this question. Bitcoin's surge might be taking some of the demand side away from Gold but hard to say exactly how much. I left 1% up side as you never know what our political culture right now can do to drive up gold prices."
