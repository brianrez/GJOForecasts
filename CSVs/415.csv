Having said that, there appears to be a rejection of the extremes of the political spectrum. Support for the right-wing coalition had fallen to 24% of the vote for President Sebastián Piñera in a recent election and the loss of many municipalities that had traditionally voted for the right and considered an indictment of the centre right who blocked progressive reforms. Only 40% of the vote went to the establishment candidates and 60% to independents and/or newcomers. There is a demand for a rewriting of Pinochet’s constitution, during his military rule, the dismissal of government backed candidates in these elections plus the election of two-thirds of the Independent and opposition candidates will enable a new constitution. Pinera has stated that his government and the other traditional parties are attuned to the populace. Boric would appear to be at the forefront of this progressive movement, while Sichel is an independent and considered a centrist but difficulty to position politically. Of the other potential candidates José Antonio Kast is possibly too right wing and Yasna Provoste Campillay who is also centrist but may be considered part of the establishment given her long career in government."
