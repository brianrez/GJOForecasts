Realistically, there will need to be one more larger SPAC to push it over as the small ones (~300m) are doing the heavy lifting and there probably aren't enough to make up the other 15b on their own.

With that in mind, and 29 weeks left in the year, and with a few potentially large SPAC's in the wings, it seems more than likely to cross the $140b mark but heavily dependent on outliers to cross 180b (ie. Robinhood). It would realistically only take one or two of these to push past 180b and there is active work being done to work around the new rules (https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/wall-street-grapples-with-new-spac-equity-contracts-after-regulator-crackdown). The 85% drop in activity in April/May vs the first quarter is unlikely to last and probably more indicative of learning how to work with the new rules. I'm betting it will be a few more months before activity really picks up again but the incentives are huge so I believe its more a matter of when than if. I'll dial back 5% from 89% over 180b until there is more news, or a major transaction."

There's a total of 219 IPOs (a leftover of 6 ""Filed for IPO"" of 2020 + 213 this year) IPOs already in the pipeline. More is likely to come, and even in times of rocky stock markets, the frenzy could continue due to a favorable structure (taxes? liquidity?). The structure likely also allows smaller and younger companies that are probably not mature enough for a conventional IPO to go public (ownership change) and/or stock owners to cash out, and even probably lowers the cost of going public relative to their market cap. I consider at least 600 IPOs for the full year of 2021 to be perfectly possible. The average IPO size had its erstwhile peak in 2020, and shrank to 325mn on average so far in 2021, but as long as it exceeds 300mn in the end, gross proceeds will exceed 180mn USD."
