Using NATO data (which differs from SIPRI in definition for some countries, due to SIPRI including paramilitary forces), those NATO members in Central Europe (the Baltics, former Yugoslavia, and the Visegrád group) that did not already meet the 2% target, increased their military burden in 2017 by an average of .14% of GDP. Those in Western Europe did so by a mere 0.03% of GDP. Since 2014, the figure is .2% of GDP for Central Europe, and the same .03% for Western. https://sites.tufts.edu/reinventingpeace/2018/05/02/new-sipri-figures-for-world-military-expenditure/"

Given the pressure by the Trump administration for NATO members to increase their spending, the recklessness and unpredictability of Russia, and the vulnerability of particular neighboring states, you would expect them to demonstrate the importance of the alliance by increasing their military spending. Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia have all expressed intent to reach or exceed the 2% figure in the near future, but it's uncertain whether they will in 2018, although Poland seems pretty likely to. There seems a reasonable chance that Romania will finish over. France is close, but is still operating on a 5 year defense budget that ends in 2018, with big increases voted in for 2019-2024, so I rate their chance of hitting the 2% target as basically 0%. https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2018/02/08/france-proposes-big-defense-budget-hike/"

According the NATO releases there are eight countries currently at or above the 2% mark: U.S., U.K., Greece, Poland, Latvia, Estonia, Romania and Lithuania . However, Romania and Poland are of such a thin margin that they are likely to drop below 2% as their GDPs benefit from positive economic trends across Europe during the course of 2018 leaving the total at a likely 7 allowing for any one of several bubble countries reaching the 2% mark by the end of the year."

In 2016, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Turkey spent under the 2 percent goal. In 2017, Romania was the only country from the previous group in 2016 to surpass the 2 percent mark. With that said, Latvia and Lithuania have made significant increases toward reaching the 2 percent goal in the last few years. There is a chance however that GDP growth in countries such as Romania and Poland might actually result in falling short of 2 percent defense spending. Looking at different scenarios, it is likely that Estonia, the U.S., U.K. and Greece will certainly spend 2 percent. There is a scenario involving Romania and Poland GDP growth pushing them under the 2 percent but this would be offset by Latvia and Lithuania making for at least six, potentially eight with Turkey as the kicker. Finally, since 2014, in response to Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region, a majority of NATO members have put in place a plan to reach the 2 percent goal by 2024. For this reason, future projections assume a majority of countries are working towards increasing their share rather than looking to decrease spending."

The rest lag behind. Germany spent 1.19% of its GDP on defense last year, France forked out 1.78%. Canada, Slovenia, Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg all spend less than 1%. Fear of Russian aggression is driving some of the recent spending splurge. Latvia, which shares a border with Russia, increased its defense budget by 42% in 2016. Its neighbor Lithuania boosted its outlays by 34%. Both, however, are still below the 2% threshold. Germany, which has more fiscal room for manoeuvre than any other NATO country, spends just 1.2% of its GDP on defence. Spain and Italy have also cut their military budgets to around 1% during the past decade. _________________________ There are many reasons why country cannot spend more than 2% of their GDP in defense; one of them for example is that many EU countries have 0 growth and aging population. A country cannot buy tanks if they do not have enough military personnel to operate them. France, Germany, Belgium and Norway announced plans to buy jets and submarines jointly. Perhaps they should also consider giving citizenship to immigrants that join the army, just like America does."

Before it was spending 1.47 (2016), Nato forecasted 1.52%. https://www.nato.int/docu/pr/2017/pr2017-111_e.xlsx If TRT' s source is correct, than Turkey definitely will spend more than 2%.

According to the method used by NATO to calculate defense spending it is far easier for some countries to hit the target than others. For example pensions paid to former staff count as defense spending, so a country that formerly had a lot of people in its armed services would have higher pension payments that a country that was increasing the ranks in its armed services. Some countries counts as defense spending amounts that NATO does not and would probably be prepared to stick to their view that their defense spending is higher than NATO says it is."

It is possible they maintain spending at this level or that their GDP drops and they don't adjust spending as quickly. I will look into this more but my thought it is very unlikely a 6th country joins and that is reflected in these scores. The 6th spender would have to increase their spending on defence so dramatically (or see their GDP collapse) that I just don't see a rationale/catalyst.

The NATO guideline is that 20% of expenditure should be on equipment, which is fairly easy to increase (if the will exists). but even doubling the amount that most NATO countries spend on equipment would only increase their total spend by 7% to 15% which is a long way short of getting them up to 2% of GDP. As personnel costs include pensions under the NATO definition even increasing the numbers of serving personnel has less effect of percentage personnel costs as it first appears (i.e. salary costs of current employees would increase, but pension costs would not). Unless there is an obvious immediate danger (as there is in the Baltic countries) NATO is more likely to continue to expect to see progress on increasing expenditure towards the 2% figure in a 5 or 6 year time frame than insisting on hitting the 2% figure by next year and having much of the extra money spent on untrained personnel and/or unsuitable equipment."

Over the last few years more countries have accepted that they need to spend more to meet their NATO obligations and the arrival of Trump has probably concentrated minds on the need, but defense spending is not something that its easy to turn on and off in two years. I suppose countries could order some expensive weapons system in order to hit the target, but its unlikely that that would produce effective extra defense capabilities in just two years. Expanding facilities, training personnel, equipment delivery times all make ramping up defense spending difficult. Doing so when many governments are still pursuing spending reductions in other areas will be politically difficult. There are a few countries (e.g. Baltic States) that are not that far off the 2% target, but several that if they see the need could adopt some creative accounting to hit the target. (As German has pointed out where does peace keeping expenditure end and defense expenditure start; lots of countries could probably claim that cyber security was part of defense, and maybe some police expenditure, and what about dual use airports, ports, planes, ships, hospitals etc.)"
