Ultimately the fact that there is nothing on the agenda I do not see an outer space resolution being passed.

Also, since 2013 these resolutions tend to be passed near the middle-end of December of the previous year, or in other words, at the end of the first quarter of the General Assembly session (runs Sep - Sep). So, I forecast a near certainty that a resolution will be adopted, and will be done so before May 1st. Also space is an area of competition between the US and China. China tends to use the space issue to support their narrative of ""respect for the legitimate interests and values of nations, regardless of their social systems or their levels of development"". China uses space as a wedge issue to paint US space superiority as militarized and exclusive. Thus, I think it is very likely China would use the UN, as they have in the past, to support their narrative and vote for a resolution as an alternative to US efforts. The only thing driving this down to 90% is the non-standard year we are having with COVID; the global pandemic may divert some attention away from traditional issues and possibly delay past May a vote."

Based on that hope, Chinese and Russians may feel even more prone to make a proposal.

The COPUOS still hosts discussions and managed to get some treaties signed in the past but the opposite views that motivate the US on one side and China and Russia on the other side make very unlikely the possibility of a sudden new proposal before May 2021. The new US administration won't have time between January and May to open fruitful discussions with the other nations. In addition, the US is in the process of building its own alliance and its own set of rules, to be followed unilaterally within its group of partners (Artemis accords and current NASA efforts to gather support)—perhaps hoping to create customary law. There has been no significant change or disaster recently that could push all nations to acknowledge the outer space risks and threats and agree together on norms or code of conduct (at least). Even, if such an event would happen (like the Iridium-Cosmos collision), it is almost impossible to make a deal in such a short time window. This subject is a legal issue which may have tremendous consequences (hinder some states in pursuing their desired strategies), if the wording of a resolution was not adequate. There is however still a small probability that China would attempt a diplomatic move (as they have already tried in the past) to make a proposal. In such a case, there are 99% chances the US would veto it, either by principle (absence of trust in China and belief that they have a hidden evil goal) or for good reason."

I don't know that this is very likely given all other world issues the US faces with COVID relief, immigration/refugee situations, etc. I think China's likelihood of taking time on this issue is high, and I believe they are an influential voice on this matter. Given this, I expect the two most likely scenarios are ""No"" or ""Yes, and China will vote for it."" Hopefully, this is helpful."

Since China has consistently voted 'yes' on several of the resolutions up for a vote, it seems like a very safe bet.

New and refined info: Outside view stuff: 1) Despite COVID, voting will occur. So no need to worry that our forecast will get messed up as a result of a vote not occurring. 2) There has never been a Security Council vote on any space issue, so the only place a vote would come up regarding space will be in the General Assembly Inside view stuff: 3) There are several resolutions on space that are due to come up for a vote the week of Oct 26 (next week!). So there will definitely be a resolution that gets voted on prior to May 1, 2021. 4) Of these upcoming resolutions, based on past precedent, China will definitely vote yes on all -- *with the only exception being* that it's not clear how China would vote on the UK's resolution on responsible behavior in space. So that's the big question. There is some possibility that China will align itself with Russia on that vote -- that is, vote against. My contact is going to send me material on China's voting behavior on a cybersecurity issue in the past, in which China aligned itself with Russia in voting against the Western position on a resolution; the ""explanation of vote"" on that one may help give insight into whether China might also align itself with Russia in voting ""no"" on the upcoming peaceful uses of space resolution 5) In the meantime, my inside contact's best guess is that China will either vote ""against"" or will abstain on the UK's responsible behavior in space resolution. So that's what I have for you at the current time!"

I reacted to your posting in our team chat, with confirmation from the UN librarian that that is the go-to website for country voting records. To answer your question, I don't see why the UN wouldn't have a resolution up for a vote in December, and why China wouldn't vote for it, as they have every year since 1983, as you note. Even with Covid, the UN would still be able to vote on stuff remotely, right?"

Overall believe that if a resolution does come up for vote it could be the China Russia draft or nothing comes up for vote at all.

Continuing Outside View: The Security Council is the only UN body in continuous session (a rep of each of its 15 member states are on call at all times). So in theory it could meet at any point between now and May 1, 2020, on a space resolution. JBURD makes a good point that the Security Council only considers issues having to do with peace and security, though, so there would have to be a peace and security element at stake for that body to vote on a space resolution. Inside View: Is there a controversy or question regarding space and peace and security that the UN is currently preoccupied with, that could be a catalyst for a resolution? The UN Office for Outer Space Affairs has not put forth a resolution since 2017: http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/resolutions.html The First Committee did approve four draft resolutions intended to avert militarization of outer space in Nov 2019, though: https://www.un.org/press/en/2019/gadis3642.doc.htm If those are draft resolutions, presumably they could be brought up at some point for actual approval? Since they have to do with security in space, then maybe they would be resolutions that the Security Council might approve? I haven't so far found any info that indicates that the Security Council needs to or plans to take up consideration of one of the 4 resolutions mentioned in the link above, so for now I will agree with JBURD's forecast."

Looks like they are working around COVID restrictions at this time. The following link has outer space discussion in the briefing book. https://reachingcriticalwill.org/images/documents/Disarmament-fora/1com/1com20/briefingbook/FCBB-2020-outerspace.pdf. Appears that there is high level of international interest to keep Outer Space discussions and normalization moving forward. Like @TDHesslink stated below, there has been a resolution regarding Outer Space, voted favorable by a unanimous margin, for the past several years, four alone in 2019. The GA only needs 50% to pass a non-legally binding resolution. The U.S. has pushed back the most in recent years. Given the current competitive environment, and more China and Russian alignment and consensus, I foresee resolutions presented that are more favorable to the Chinese that they will vote yes on. The comments on p. 42 of the UN First Committee briefing book need a deeper look and may impact the probability for this year."

So i went to tbe UN website and learned a bit of commitees an GA workings. The first committee is working a draft. The worki g draft is the china-russia draft. There is a godd chance it comes ojt of committee. So it has to pass the committee and then go to the GA. The GA does its substantial work thru december (according towikipedia) and the jan-may is more consultations tha voting. Not that something couldn't happen then. But if it did vote, it will be a china approved draft. So the NO represents the probability it does not clear committee."
