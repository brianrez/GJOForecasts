In March 2021 they increased to greater than $4000 per tonne. So I have questions - will the price oscillate as before. I think there is less likelihood as prices have have increased slowly but steadily over the last couple of months. The other factor is where China will stop buying. Given the time scale (3 weeks) there would have to be a good diplomatic ruction and the likelihood again is low. So expect it to increase, but only just."

Prices seem elevated just as many commodities currently are so it seems it more a question of when prices drop than if. China is pushing back on metal prices already and that is likely to have run on effects with other commodities. I'm not confident enough to give 2-1 odds on it dropping but will start at 38% and adjust from there.

Factors affecting price are supply and demand, how will the supply be impacted (possibly negatively)? How will the demand change? Looking at the uses of milk powder it is used a lot in baked goods/sweets... it might be that post lockdown people have a bit of a health drive and there could be less demand.
