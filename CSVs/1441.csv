First, because Amazon has been searching for its second headquarters for more than a year, it is logical to conclude that Amazon will hold a press conference to announce this decision. The concluding time for this challenge question is 2:59 AM EST on 1 October 2018, approximately two hours from now. Therefore, it is unlikely that Amazon will have a press conference to announce their decision, while their audience would be substantially suboptimal, within the next two hours.ï»¿ Second, reports have been published that Amazon officials visited a Chicago bid location in late August, alluding to the fact that the selection process is ongoing (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-hq2-reps-visited-chicago-second-time-report-2018-9). These officials' trip to the Chicago location is notable, as "" it could mean the contest is far from over, and it may be more-open than had previously been speculated."" (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-hq2-reps-visited-chicago-second-time-report-2018-9). Lastly, Amazon officials have asserted that they will make their decision by the end of the year and strategically it would be the most logical to wait to select a city until after the 2018 elections, as Amazon will seek to ensure that the deals and incentives that they received from respective city and state governments are still valid post-election (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-to-announce-the-location-of-its-second-hq-by-the-end-of-2018-2018-9)"

There's also the political angle that Bezos is potentially considering running for office- an economic boon with his name on it would play well in a crucial part of the country for the electoral college. Similar to Zuckerberg making noise and headlines in Iowa. Not to mention the fact that Google recently invested in Chicago, as well as McDonald's corporate moving their headquarters from suburban Chicago to within the city in a play to take advantage of the young talent hub that is Chicago. Certainly my viewpoint comes with some bias, but seeing as I don't live in the area anymore (I live abroad) I can add some level of objectivity. The other percentages come from a pragmatic standpoint: they are already heavy in the Pacific time zone, so that is unlikely. Eastern time is another favorite on population/talent density alone, though Bezos already has the Washington Post to call his own. Mountain has less of a chance to that end. There is always the chance that there is no decision made but I think that is very unlikely due to the hype cycle they created and undoubtedly wish to capitalize on."

Besides what they announced, it does not seem like there is any reliable info from Amazon itself that would lead me to think that a winnowing has already been made. However, there have been independent evals of the possible sites by third parties, including Moodys and the NYT. Moody's top 4 were Austin at #1, followed by ATL, PHI, and NYC. The NYT ranked the top three according to Amazon's criteria and had Denver as the top city, followed by Boston and DC. Thus, I give a little boost to the central time zone and mountain time zone, and a discount to the pacific time zone, because there hasn't been much info about LA, and there is already a west coast HQ. I have a hunch that just due to pop density on the East Coast, as well as the nature of Amazon's business model, that they would want to locate themselves on the East Coast. Plus, both Denver and Austin are already hubs for startups, which could be a plus, but I think that Amazon would rather pick a city that it could define. Peering into the mind of Jeff Bezos, I suspect that he has an interest in building a city around his empire, like the Chinese or Google are doing, and I don't think you could do that reliably in Austin, Denver, NYC, DC, Boston, or LA, unless you located Amazon on the outskirts. Amazon pays enough to get employees to come to them, so I'm not too worried about how pop affects the outcome. I really doubt it's going to be in Columbus though. If I had to pick a city out of all of them, I'd say Pittsburg or ATL."

On the other hand Amazon does appear to be struggling for space in Seattle, even renting office space above a shop, and so clearly has a powerful incentive to get a move on. Neither does it appear that Amazon is simply holding a gun to Seattleâs head because 1) the anti-business vibe in the city means such tactics are unlikely to work, and 2) they intend to leave the original HQ there. Iâm prepared to take them at their word on this one, and making the assumption that the announcement could be any day in 2018 with equal likelihood.

Austin is a strong option considering Amazon's existing employee base and attractiveness to new employees.
