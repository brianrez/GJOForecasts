The only way by law to remove the is for the Parliament to have a vote of no confidence with at least a 20% of the electorate. But then you have the Military who could kill him or he could die of natural causes. I don't think either will happen rather elections will be held and he will leave office in the Spring of 2017. The last few PMs were around 66-67 years old when they left office and their time as PM was about 3 years. Sharif meets both of those criteria.

Various media outlets both inside and outside Pakistan are swinging behind him (perhaps as other players in the region realise that his strong leadership presents the best chance of keeping a lid on the insurgency in Pakistan, and preventing it from spilling over). Moreover, the opposition have failed to make significant gains: a petition calling for his removal on the grounds of corruption was recently presented, but seems to be gaining little popular (or legal) traction; attempts to declare his absence unconstitutional are also not making progress. A letter supposedly written by Sharif personally opposing India's admission to the Nuclear Suppliers Group is also being heavily publicised in Pakistan - this is a highly populist move designed to shore up popular support throughout the country."

Nawaz looks weak in the picture. He looks vulnerable. Should I have pity on him? Should we have empathy? Should I be relieved he made it? Reassured he will be ok? The picture is grainy. I can't make out the vital signs of the monitor above his head, the ET tube does not look secured, the ART-line transducer is not at the phlebostatic axis, where is the CVP and swan transducers, where is the ventilator? Ventilator tubes are not that long the Vent should be on the other side of the bed, where are the chest tubes, pacemaker and on and on.....who is this picture intended for? Not me, not the rest of the healthcare community. Maybe other world leaders or the general Pakistan population more like it. Everyday Pakistanis would not have a clue. How would an everyday Pakistanis view this picture? How about Pakistanis leaders? It may not be politically viable for Pakistani opposition leaders to form a coup or somehow subvert Sharif's leadership while he is recovering from heart surgery that may backfire. Perhaps this is all about something else? What I have no idea."

He had successful open heart surgery in London in June, 2016 (his second visit to London for medical attention in 2016), but his health problems and the protracted absences from Pakistan that they have caused have led to calls for an interim Prime Minister to be elected in his stead in the last month. An attempt by Ishaq Dar, the Pakistani finance minister, to act as PM in Sharif's absence have triggered a constitutional crisis, leading to demands for his immediate return to office. There is some speculation that this is a ploy by the opposition to force Sharif's hand - if he is not well enough to return to office, and another cannot act as PM in his place, then this could trigger an immediate general election, or at least the official appointment of a caretaker PM."

14761,2016-05-25T01:52:41Z,1,[23.0],[23.0],"The current elected government has been in power for eight years. Since 1947 civilian governments have lasted respectively 11 years, 6 years and 11 years again before being overthrown by the military. So Pakistan's history suggests the possibility of a coup in the next few years. Lets start by assuming an even money chance of a coup sometime in the next four years. The allegations of corruption against Sharif's family suggest that a coup, if it is to happen, will more than likely occur for a publicly justifiable reason, and is therefore most likely in the remaining months of 2016, though early 2017 is still quite possible. Lets say that if it happens its an 80% chance of occurring in 2016. That lowers my assessment of the odds to 50%*80%=40%. However history also suggests that democracy is taking hold-2013 gave Pakistan the first civilian transfer of power after the successful completion of a five year term by a democratically elected government. Presumably also the military has a weather eye on the chaos that has ensued in the middle east after the overthrow of governments, albeit not democratic ones. I will arbitrarily calculate that each of these factors halves the potential risks and bring my forecast down to 40%*1/2*1/2=10%. The next factor to consider is Sharif pledging to resign if found to be corrupt. At the moment he has plausible deniability as the allegations concern his family and not him. I believe that an inquiry will be under international pressure to keep Pakistan's democracy on track for fear of Pakistan's nuclear capabilities. Basis this I'll leave the odds where they are. However a couple of other possibilities to consider are 1) Sharif personally getting implicated as more documents are revealed and 2) Sharif being the victim of a plane crash, bombing or even his death from natural causes. I think these factors combined increase the odds by 1) 10% and 2) 3%. Total 23%"

This constrains the preference set to a small number of choices and consequently, with one outcome (leaving office), preferences over choices are an extremely small set. Since corruption, patronage and de facto military/ruling elite coalition are prominent features of the Pakistani polity, one should expect that the PM's minimum winning coalition will remain in tact. Therefore, given the function, g: X --> A choices under conditions of certainty, require that {a1, ...., a(k)} be mapped topologically as one member of A to the outcome set X. X = {x1, ..., x(n)}. this constraint requires that the conditional action or choice in a maximized choice set suggest that the only option that would result in an outcome of the PM leaving office, is when he no longer has the support of the minimum winning coalition in the polity. If this conditional outcome requires a negative action (or choice) compared to the previous preference, then the outcome will suggest a likely possibility that the PM will leave office. However, given that the PM leaving office requires a choice set of A = {coercion, loss of a minimum coalition, and significant threat toward the PM}, this would be analytically and theoretically support leaving office. However, given that corruption in Pakistan is deeply ingrained in its polity and the Panama Papers revelation has been open knowledge in Pakistan for some time, we can deduce with a high degree of confidence that the PM will not leave office. While he is left with an uncomfortable option if explaining the matter, it does not change the actions and choice which will lead to him leaving office."

1639,2016-05-18T15:18:52Z,1,[35.0],[35.0],"Sharif asked the opposition and other lawmakers to help form a parliamentary commission. Previous efforts to have a retired or sitting Supreme Court judge chair a judicial commission have stalled as all the judges rejected the offer. It is not clear if the opposition will take up Sharif’s latest offer. They walked out soon after Sharif stopped speaking, angered that seven questions they posed to him ahead of the parliamentary session were not answered. “Not a single question has been answered by the PM,” said Khursheed Shah, leader of the opposition in the National Assembly. Imran Khan, leader of the opposition PTI party, said: “We didn’t need to hear such a long story. He could have shown the documents as I have done so.” Opposition politicians said they would announce on Tuesday their response to Sharif’s speech. Analys http://www.arabnews.com/news/nawaz-sharif-proposes-panama-papers-probe-parliament-opposition-walks-out ****** COMMENT: Nawaz Sharif is probably as guilty as sin, but so is the opposition leader Imran Khan. I wonder if Pakistani Parliament will consider that it is ""better the devil you know than the devil you don’t'"""
