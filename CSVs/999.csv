But others have noted the peak in April or May usually ends up pretty close to the December 1st value, and this year that value was well over 414 and exceeded the trend quite a bit. On the other hand though I took a look at September and October 1st, and September 1st is on trend but October 1st is over trend. But looking at the October 1st to December 1st gain each year, the years where October 1st is over trend appear to have lower gains from October to December. I'm thinking the data is a bit noisy and the trend is probably the most reliable. But the April-May peak matching fairly close with the December 1st value is leading me to be much less confident and it could go either way."

By my count, keeping the level below 414 PPM on 1 December from where we are now would require downward deviation of ~3-4% from average in the rate CO2 is added to the atmosphere (from all sources, not just human, and assuming that CO2 fixation during N hemisphere summer stays right on average); easily within the realm of natural variation, but a heavy lift indeed for human factors alone; - Quick look at the general outlook for northern hemisphere summer doesn’t give much reason to think that CO2 fixation will increase, but this is something that could have a dramatic impact on the probabilities; - One or more of the below would seriously change my estimate of the probabilities: - 1) Weather - N hemisphere (or ocean) having an unexpectedly productive (or poor) growing season; also, if one of the strong Nino/Nina effects comes into play (NOAA estimate is 60% chance of remaining in neutral Nino effect for this year), would have to look at effect of changing Pacific H2O temps on marine CO2 sequestration as well as effect on terrestrial growing season; - 2) Major natural CO2 emitting event; - 3) Strong deviations from expectation in NOAA CO2 observational data from coming months; - 4) Much stronger than expected change in human CO2 emissions because of... whatever might cause something this big (back of the envelope math suggests that absent significant movement in the natural factors, this would have to be REAL serious - something on the order of a 60% reduction)."

Electricity + Land then industry, transport buildings make up most of CO2 driven by humans. Fires, also a bit unknown (they put more co2 in air, also volcanoes). But putting altogether suggests a little below 414.4 is most likely but might not be my much. To show no growth is very very hard. Never happened in last 50 years despite recessions - and much of CO2 s baked in from what has happened from a long while back. As of March figs = 413.9 and previous years the Dec fig is a little higher than the March Fig.... So a lot will depend on how hard COVID hits over the year. I split it across the two mid figures. ( I had expected to see a strong dip in March given the China shut down, but the data doesn't quite agree, so maybe industrial shut down not making such a large impact)"

The seasonal pattern is very stable and the seasonally adjusted component is approximated with the Loess-method. This can cause the trend line to ""wobble"" a bit when new data become available and we get closer to the prediction date. This is the case with these data and in general the result is that when the CO2-value drops after the month of May, the STL-model tends to underpredict the value for December 1st. On average this is 0.2 ppm, so this is not critical given that the differences between the levels is 2 ppm. At present (2020-01-25) the prediction is 414.6 ppm with a sigma of 0.166 ppm.

Confidence levels for the lower side of the range is very low and presumes significant action toward limiting climate change by the major world economies, including the US. As this has obviously not been the case the likelihood of the lower end of the scale is very low. The impact of the climate change related fires in Australia and other locations around the planet might accelerate CO2 values significantly, however no data is available to extrapolate so confidence levels are again kept very low.

I tried to take a look ath the GOSAT data but it seems too much hassle for me. Perhaps those more inclined would offer an assesment of its usefulness? I did however find some interesting papers. Apparently this data can be more useful than the NOAA ground station data in identifying seasonality trends, in a more precise way than ARIMA estimations: https://www.atmos-meas-tech.net/12/2611/2019/amt-12-2611-2019.pdf Also some chinese researchers have used the data to feed it into a neural network : An Assessment of Anthropogenic CO2 Emissions by Satellite-Based Observations in China https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6427755/"

If this doubles it would mean an extra 380Mtonnes or +0.05 ppm. Even if the damage is 10 times more than the yearly average it would only increase 0.5 ppm. This is not nothing, but not too large.

The middle class on earth is growing. It’s income and consume is growing. The need of growing energy is therefore necessary. About 1500 coal power station are under construction on earth. China and USA generating about 80% of CO2 or so. Both burning about one billions ton coal per year besides millions of barrels oil per day. China is allowed by all climate contracts to increase its CO2 output per year until 2030 and India, too, as far as I know."

I would add that there seems to be a smaller increase in years where there is a decreased economic activity, and therefore I am going to bear in mind the chances of a US recession (which would then affect the global economy, at roughly around 15%) which would drop the increase into the second bucket of options."

First, predicting a series that displays a broad trend (upward sloping) but also cycles. The cycles seem to peak in early May and reach their minimum in late August. The cycles are very constant over time. The trend also seems pretty constant, but may be increasing as global warming becomes more and more of a problem."
