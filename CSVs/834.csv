The automotive industry is in chaotic stress as they invest in EV's and AV's and try to keep us buying ICE's. Apple on the other hand has a very profitbale franchise in personal electronics and a market leadership position. I can see Apple adding value in autos via their existing franchise, but to pick a winner and limit their money and influence to that winner would seem unlikely, limiting and doomed. Disclosure: I have been wrong before."

By helping out the French government, which would probably have to nationalize Renault otherwise, Apple could achieve pacification in their relationship to France, which are now contaminated by the French digital tax, in exchange for a guarantee for Renault's long term existence. With its Renault Z.E. product line, it's one of the more innovative car manufacturers, however probably lacking a consistent strategy, an OS and a proprietary car entertainment system, a global reach and financial fire power for further development (as most manufacturers at the moment). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_Fluence_Z.E. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault%E2%80%93Nissan%E2%80%93Mitsubishi_Alliance#Zero-emission_vehicles In that way, Apple could contribute to the EVs' further market penetration without bearing the risk of constructing and operating factories themselves. I do see some industrial logic, and at the current market valuations, traditional car makers and their assets (brand value etc.) are for grabs at or below book value, while tech companies are awash with cash without a breakthrough innovative idea or product generation in the past few years."
