Please..... people in glass houses should not be throwing stones. Or that someone from the BRICS nations should lead. Brazil? Russia? South Africa? Really? These stellar examples on how to run an economy? Of course, Putin would LOVE to have a Russian running the Fund. Someone from the FSB. You betcha. India? Maybe.... China? I think they would be cool to let her run the show a bit longer. She treats them with a lot of respect. Don't the BRICS already run the New Development Bank?

Eight of the 24 Executive Directors were from advanced European economies, and an additional two Executive Directors represented groups of countries that included at least one advanced European economy. Some argue that this is an overabundance of European Executive Directors, which critics argue limits the ability of non-European Executive Directors to represent adequately their constituencies’ interests and for IMF members to hold their Executive Director accountable. They have suggested that European voices on the Board should be consolidated, allowing for more seats on the Board to be controlled by emerging and developing countries. Several of the Executive Directors represent large constituencies of African and South American countries, many of which are among the IMF’s poorest members who depend on the IMF for lending""[1]"

I am unsure how the French legal system works, but I do recall her French lawyers making some statement about ""appealing"" something. I'm not sure what she would be appealing in advance of the trial, but presumably this comes first. The one data point I have picked up is that a ruling as to the admissibility of Sarkozy's diaries will be made on (or by) March 11th. I'm not sure how the trial (investigation?) that involves the Sarkozy diaries relates (if at all) to Lagarde. In any case, knowing the sequence and timing would be helpful to anticipate the hurdles she might face."

First, David Lipton, First Deputy Director, stated that the next Managing Director would likely come from outside Europe. However, this prediction was conditioned upon Lagarde stepping down - which she has not indicated she will do. Second, Lagarde is involved in a political dust-up in France that could make her winning re-election less likely. However, most reports on the subject suggest that the suit will not likely be a factor in her selection. Other factors suggest Lagarde is well positioned for a second term: adding the yuan to the SDR has likely reduced the likelihood of a challenge from the BRIC countries and, of course, Lagarde seems to want to pursue a second term. Of the previous ten managing directors, four served more than one term so serving multiple terms is not unprecedented. It should be more likely than not that Lagarde returns in her position. If she doesn't, Lipton's comment suggests a non-European Managing Director is more likely than a European Managing Director."

I can't see how the constant re-hashing of her involvement, regardless of any trial outcome(s), can lead anywhere but to her gracefully departing the IMF. This certainly can't be the public face that the IMF wants to portray to the average citizen, for many of whom the Lagarde/Tapie affair will be their very first introduction to the IMF. Moreover, despite the current narrative having two primary firewalls of misinformation, L'affaire Tapie has the potential to break through these and reach back far beyond the rather late entrance of Lagarde into the story. It's a messy story that many want not to be understood. (For the cognoscenti of GJO, the central fact is that the original Tapie claim of having been defrauded by Crédit Lyonnais was valid [and not for simply ""undervaluing"" the Adidas transaction, but for undisclosed conflicts-of-interest which breached fiduciary duties]; and is the pivot from which the story can be re-interpreted in both chronological directions. The subsequent political contribution element was merely a ""raise"" by Tapie upon an already winning hand.) http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/ars%C3%A8ne-wenger-can-teach-us-all-a-lesson-in-decency-1.2480404"

The real question will be whether Lagarde decides to contest the French presidential elections in 2017, which may result in her resignation from the IMF at the end of her term. Either way, a European is most likely to head the IMF, when considering the disproportionate voting rights of European states as well as the United States.

On one side it's a sure thing, on the other side, an election have a lot of incertitudes. From the FMI view 1- if we look what his predecessor (DSK) left , she's good; 2- on her first term, some BRICS countries took some more % of power. This move should make her in a better position from those countries. Europe lost some % of power, but i doubt that europe would vote against her; 3- stability"
