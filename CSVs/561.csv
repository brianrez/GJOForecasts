The trend of deaths of each day is not a smooth line, it usually has a peak which might be the reason that it takes time to report death. 2. The number of deaths is correspondent with the confirmed covid cases but is delayed because it takes time for the human body to fight against the virus. According to the covid cases reported by CDC and related reports, the delay is approximately 6-9 days. 3. The confirmed cases is decreasing since January 14 and the recent 7-day average death is declining from 3114 on the 14th to 2124 on the 19th. The total deaths on the past 7 days lies on 14,868 which is close to 14,000.

Having reviewed European examples, the death rate tends to drop more slowly from the peak and I think this will also bear out as it is still too early for the vaccine to make a radical difference. In the UK for example the vaccine has reached 10% population but death rates are still very high (partly due to varients)."
