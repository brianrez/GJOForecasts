Given how stable public opinion has been, and how long it tends to be before it changes, I’m feeling increasingly confident that we will see the Question resolve in bin #2. Outside credible chance that some new disaster or scandal could take us to bin #1, e.g. Ukraine, etc. but I don’t think it’s likely to matter enough, soon enough in the current hyper-polarized political climate."

He's not a big salesman of his accomplishments or his agenda as his predecessor was and the public has gotten accustomed to that in the way our world communicates and interacts today. The press also has proven not as friendly as it seems to be more interested in clicks and engagement which is more often than not a result of controversy, conflicting, exposes. Much of the US press has evolved into not just a partisan arm but also business entities and ideological bodies whose jobs is to dig for the dirt, the flaw, the crooked, negative aspect of any issue. That seems to be the focus of reporting. Biden's demeanor itself in a time where drum wars are sounding do not help when put in comparison to an opponent that sells the image Putin does. October, November may paint a different picture for Biden but I think March is more challenging."

The news flow from that presidency--because of its seriousness and impact on a variety of major issues (foreign, domestic, economic, etc.)--almost certainly included some events that would've very likely caused much more significant swings in pre-2000's US public opinion. The presidency before that also had a very low amount of variation in approval ratings, although arguably there were far fewer ""shocks"" to the political system. - The trends of Biden's and Obama's approval ratings during the first year of their respective presidencies seem visually fairly similar.

There are also few anticipated events that will help Biden raise his numbers.

Given recent issues with vaccinations, Delta and now Afghanistan, his popularity has certainly waned, but equally 45% could now be factoring in most of the bad news, and I think he'll recover some ground after bottoming out around 42% (I can't see him being less popular than Trump). Above 55%? Obama struggled with this after a brief 'honeymoon' period above 60% and I think Biden may follow a similar but less extreme pattern; he's not as charismatic, but equally my impression is that he's not as polarising, and he's walking quite a tight path to achieve any gains, so I think his popularity may stay in a narrower band. Politics seems even more divided now than when Obama started, so anything much above 50% within 6 months looks ambitious. As for the middle ground, a lot will likely depend on the economy and the fading Delta curve through the end of the year. Barring another new covid variant, political upturn or war (which covers quite a lot, fair enough) I suspect everyone will feel slightly more positive into next Spring and he'll be rated marginally higher than now."

Broadly speaking, unless there's a war or terrorist attack, he's probably going to slide 3-6%. Democratic presidents seem less likely to start something, so that's less likely. The only real hope for an upswing is that the pessimism around Afghanistan is over by then (short attention spans and all). Past that; it's the economy, stupid. Markets are riding high and cracks are showing, both economically and with pandemic response, pretty much on a global scale. I'm not optimistic things will be better in 6 months than they are now, so it's most likely he'll slide. Frankly, from an outside perspective, he seems to be falling a bit flat and that doesn't bode well for his approval rating either. Recent history indicates that a more polarized electorate is more critical, so he'll probably be below historical averages regardless. I'll go ~60% in the 40-45 box and think its more likely to be above than below, then will weight out from there."
