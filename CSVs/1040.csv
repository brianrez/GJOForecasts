However considering that the situation is still volatile and a probability of another incident triggering violence exists, I am retaining 20% chance of Chile being under emergency on 26th Nov.

It also seems that Pinera is trying meet the protestors demands by sacking his cabinet and siding with protestors against police abuse. It is unclear however why the state of emergency was lifted if the protests were ongoing and seems that there is not a will to impose this on a population with bad memories of military crackdowns. However you only need a couple of bad incidents for this to be reinstated and therefore there is a chance that this will be imposed agin however not very high

Overall rough probability estimate - 50% probability of a clear escalation in violence in short term; in this instance, 80% chance of use of SOE/SOS by 26 November as opposed to 20% chance of relying on further concession/negotiation to manage situation."

Recent violence including protestor deaths seems likely to exacerbate security conditions in the country in the short term. Efforts made by the Chilean government to address protestor grievances have not resulted in major reductions on protest levels.
