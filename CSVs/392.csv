Although Keir is currently polling at a 34% approval rating and the Labour party’s major donor, Unite, has threatened to pull its funding, I do not believe that he will face a formal challenge for leadership before April 4, 2021 (BBC News, 2022) (YouGov, 2022a). There is only one formal way for his position of leader to be challenged and that is by having 20% of the Labour Party’s MPs nominate a contender (Zodgekar & Durrant, 2020). From looking online, I was not able to locate any rumors about anyone planning to challenge Keir in the near future. In my opinion if someone were planning to challenge his role before April 4th there would have to be some trace of a rumor since we are less than a month away from that date, and the challenger has to at least have 20% of the votes from the current MPs. Additionally, when asked if Keir should remain leader of the Labour party, 41% of the people polled stated that he should, which is higher than his approval rating (YouGov, 2022b)."

Unite is a company that has been the Labour Party's single largest donor. However, they recently cut their funding. Although this was the case recently, I don't believe any of the other candidates have a chance, because Sir Keir Starmer has too much of an advantage. The competition and challenge Sir Keir Starmer faces is the controversy that is presented by Boris Johnson. However, none of the information presented has been enough to weaken the view of the current leader of the Labour Party"

The reason for my prediction is that Starmer’s only threat in holding his position as Labour Party leader would come from the ardent supporters of former MP Corbyn. Corbyn was expelled from the party and has been surrounded by much controversy regarding anti-Semitic remarks. Given Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this past week, which features a (false) narrative by Russia regarding “de-nazifying Ukraine” (despite its president being Jewish and a descendant of Holocaust survivors), the democratic Western coalition of countries, including the United Kingdom, have solidified into strongly condemning Russia’s unprovoked aggression. Any Labour Party members who previously advocated for Corbyn, who were anti-Starmer, will face an even more difficult task of distancing themselves from a former leader who stands on the wrong side of the public narrative. Starmer is pro-NATO in a political party that is left-leaning and has historically advocated for peace, however the narrative by pro-Corbyn members that NATO has provoked Russia will only bolster Starmer’s public image as an assertive politician advocating for stricter sanctions and actions against Russian oligarchs and Vladimir Putin."
105148,2022-03-06T02:38:29Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"In reading the links provided by GJP, I learned that the only way for Labour MPs to initiate a formal challenge is by submitting a written form to the general secretary of the party nominating a challenger who has at least 20% support of the combined ranks of the Labour MPs. Given that we’re already in early March 2022, in order for the answer to be a yes, the challenge would need to be initiated in relatively short order. In that case, I would expect to see significant talk around an imminent challenge, however in further research I have not seen that. The time binding of the question I think significantly limits the probability here. Also, in looking at the wording of the question, I think it’s important to note that this only asks whether he would “face” a formal challenge in the given time period, not whether he will win an election initiated by a formal challenge or whether he would potentially resign. That said, in a further look at the polling data on yougov.co.uk it looks as if Sir Starmer’s approval rating has rebounded from lows in early May 2021 (note GJP question initiated August 2021) where only 17% felt he was doing well and 65% felt he was doing poorly. As of 9 February 2022, 34% reported he was doing well while 49% felt he was doing badly. In another poll from at the same site from 12 January 2022, 41% felt he should remain as Labour party leader while 27% felt he should stand down. This shows a reversal from 22 September 2021, where 35% felt Sir Starmer should stand down while just 30% felt he should remain. Given those trends, if a formal challenge was not issued previously I think it’s unlikely that one would be prior to the 4 April 2022 deadline of this question, especially given the uncertainty internationally right now."

Considering Sir Stramer was named after the Labour Party’s founder Keir Hardie, it appears Sir Starmer and his family are staunch Labour Party member/supporter. Sir Starmer won the election by 56.2% of the vote in the first round of polling succeeding Jeremy Corbyn. However, the Labour Party is dissatisfied with Sir Starmer leadership and lack of kept promises (skynews.com). Specifically, the Labour Party suffered a significant electoral loss in Hartlepool, a Labour Party stronghold, and narrow win (323 votes) over conservative Ryan Stephenson in another Labour Party stranglehold (nytimes.com). This being said, I predict Sir Starmer will face a formal challenge for the leadership of the Labour Party before April 4, 2022."

The political party is gaining much traction as of late as the main opposition party in regards to almost all formal government policies that represent the status quo. Sir Keir Starmer stands in a position to take full advantage of his peers and political opponents' failures while being able to control the narrative. “Opinion polling has suggested for weeks that the government's pain has been Labour's gain. But that poll lead wobbles up and down, and there is no way Labour can be sure it will last. In his recent clashes with Mr Johnson, Sir Keir has undoubtedly profited from not being the other guy, but when it comes to his own party leadership, he is still putting huge efforts into not being the guy that came before him.” He is also doubling down on the conflict in Ukraine by noting “He told us Labour had always been the party of Nato, pointing out that one of its earliest documents bore the signature of Ernest Bevin, a giant of the Labour movement, as he spoke of his own belief in the Western alliance of countries who would work together to defend themselves.” This coming at a time that other political parties within the UK government are under investigation for campaign contributions involving connections with Russian influence. “This seems like common sense. So why is it not happening? Perhaps the answer can be found in the Tory party’s accounts. By taking nearly £2m in donations since Boris Johnson took power in 2019, they have become just as hooked on Russian-linked money as any of the worm-tongued servicers of oligarchical wealth.” This investigation stems from the opposition political party's refusal to crack down on illicit money laundering that stems from outside the borders and has ties to the Kremlin. “Over almost 12 years of Tory government, the tendrils of the Kremlin have been allowed to wrap around the UK, turning London into the “money-laundering capital of the world”.” Considering the Ukrainian crisis is one of the top priorities for NATO states in the current world events the Labour Party will likely benefit from the talking points being led by Sir Keir Starmer and will likely not be replaced in the short term while he is making big gains in public opinion on world affairs."

He is possibly seen, as Kinnock before him, as a barrier to the hard left, as under Corbyn, that will row back on the left biased structures that allowed the latter to gain power. It is conceivable that he not perceived as a Leader, given his lack of charisma, policies and plans and the lack of presence of a power-in-waiting that would define a transformative opposition leader. He is probably surrounded by those who are considering his replacement. He is currently angering the left wing by pushing through changes that will give a weighed vote to sitting MP’s as opposed to the general membership that voted in hard left Corbyn. The changes include an uplift to 20% of MP’s required to mount a challenge that translates into a minimum of 40 members. The hard left of the party currently consist of 33 members plus one more in suspension (Corbyn) and one in a criminal trial (Webbe). It would therefore appear that a challenge from the hard left has been neutered. The soft left has Lisa Nandy, who put herself forward in the last Leadership competition, but she vowed never to run again due the sexist, toxic environment she experienced. This is probably indicative as the why The Labour Party has never elected a woman to be leader. There is also Angela Rayner (soft left?), who has possibly alienated some members by her comments concerning the Conservative Party as ‘ ‘We cannot get any worse than a bunch of scum, homophobic, racist, misogynistic, absolute pile… of banana republic… Etonian… piece of scum…’ which is possibly beyond the pale in civilised debate. This leaves the centre right, one Andy Burnham, currently the Mayor of Greater Manchester. He is charismatic, politically savvy with an extensive history of politics in the UK Labour party, back to the government of Tony Blair. He has indicated that he wants to complete his second term in office as Mayor but is willing to return to Westminster politics if there was a moment where that was right. A big message to the party. There is the possibility of a general election to be called 2023/24 which would suggest the embedding of a new leader sooner rather later. Given all that, I will suggest that the time it takes for the momentum to raise a challenge and the required in-fighting, he is probably safe until 4th April. The next elections are due 5th May 2021."

The most recent leaders to be challenged were Corbyn, who was challenged in 2016 following the Brexit vote, and Kinnock who was challenged in 1988. Both retained the leadership. It therefore seems unlikely that there will be a challenge. Nonetheless, Keir is not hugely popular. He has yet to really score a meaningful victory that puts a dent in the government - more often than he would have liked he has been with the government on the losing side of an issue. He also has yet to show a path forward that convinces people to vote for Labour, as the recent by-elections have shown. There have already been rumblings of election challenges (Rayner, Butler), although it is not clear whether they would be able to obtain the support of 20% of all labour MPs, let alone have confidence of winning a subsequent leadership vote - Butler may have more of a chance with the leadership vote if she can rally Corbyn voters behind her but may be less likely to have the necessary support with MPs. But neither of them appear to be greatly favoured by the crowd right now. According to YouGov they are only the 31st and 35th most popular Labour politicians (including ex-politicians). One thing that is in favour of a challenge before the 4th of April 2022 is that if a challenge is to happen, it is likely to happen around that time. Later than that and a challenger may be better off waiting until after the next general election and possible resignation of Keir. So a potential challenger that believes they have a high probability of winning the next general election in place of Keir should challenge him for the leadership sooner rather than later. This depends not only on Keir but also on Boris - his actions may make him more or less vulnerable against different opponents. As noted above, however, the two politicians that have been named as potentially mounting a challenge are unlikely to actually do so given their low probability of winning a challenge."

The voters rejected the prospect of a hard left government and elected the relative soft ‘c’ (as it turned out) conservatism of Boris Johnson. History has shown that the country is centrist in its voting patterns. Starmer won the Leadership election by promising to uphold the left leaning policies of the previous leadership which also managed to appease the largest provider of their funding i.e McCluskey and his Unite union. McCluskey is retiring and the potential is for a softer left leadership of the union. Starmer’s actions since his election has been to steer away from the left factions, bar Corbyn and upset the Union(s) that has resulted in membership numbers and funding. The realisation being that only (relatively) centrist parties can win elections, with the example of Blair being the most successful (3 times elected as PM). History may repeat itself here, where in the 1980’s Neil Kinnock (centrist) took over from the hard left leadership of Michael Foot and then resisted a challenge from the hard left Tony Benn, purged left wing factions such as militant tendency and made ready the Labour Party to be electable under Tony Blair. Keir Starmer may represent the 2020’s version of Kinnock by purging the left to make the party electable again. The threat from the hard left of the party that is represented by the Campaign Group comprises of 32 MPs (two others, Corbyn & Webb have been suspended) which falls below the 20% (40 MPs) to allow for a challenge. A potential challenge could come from Andy Burnham, successful minister from the Blair administration, who has proved to be electable as the Mayor of Greater Manchester. He has stated that he will remain in his elected position until 2025 but has not ruled out a return to national politics at some point. I will suggest that Keir Starmer will probably remain the Labour Party Leader for the foreseeable future as the threat from the left is diminishing and the right needs time to consolidate and develop an electable party/program."
