This race is a good example. Aggregators produce odds of 4-1 for Schrier (D) over Larkin (R), while the forecasters are all stuck at toss-up, with the exception of Sabato, who rates this as lean Democrat. Cook rates this as a D+1 district, but it's a midterm, the President is a Democrat, and Schrier is a Democrat who won by a pretty slim margin last time around. Conventional wisdom says none of that bodes well for Schrier. There doesn't seem to be any decisive information hitting the press, and both candidates seem to be sticking pretty closely to the partisan scripts. Maybe I'm missing something, but 4-1 seems a bit extreme when the most heavily weighted polls on 538 for this race are two months to half a year old. I'm thinking 3-2 here for Schrier, but given the lack of decisive info, it wouldn't take much to move me one way or another."
