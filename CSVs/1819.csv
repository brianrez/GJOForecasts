I forecast that Iran will increase production to 4MMbpd sooner, sometime in Q4 of 2017, as sustained oil prices below $50 pinch Gulf budgets too much and lead to a breakdown in the OPEC production cut agreement by November, leading to OPEC members opening their taps to compete for market share and try once again to put small and medium-sized US tight oil producers (frackers) out of business."

29591,2017-05-01T20:04:36Z,14,[36.0],[-4.0],"Iran’s oil minister said at the sidelines of a meeting with the European Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy: “During the past few days, we received positive signals from OPEC and non-members, in particular Russia, about extending the agreement for the second half of 2017. We will back the agreement” (https://financialtribune.com/articles/energy/63415/iran-oil-minister-backs-extension-of-crude-supply-cuts). I’m always skeptical about what Iran’s oil minister says as there is usually a lot of backtracking that occurs after a comment is made. However, I would think its likely that Iran will follow suit if other OPEC members agree for an extension. Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei recently said “Iranians should not thank Hassan Rouhani's policy of detente with the West for any reduction in the threat of war”. Ebrahim Raisi, one of Rouhani’s main challengers said: ""We should not warn our people of wars and crises. We have full security in the country. This approach, that we should wait for foreign investment and for foreigners to resolve our issues, is wrong. This is wrong, to wait years and years for foreign investors to come ... We should resolve issues by relying on domestic capabilities” (https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2017-04-30/irans-leader-dismisses-rouhanis-detente-policy-ahead-of-vote) The fact that Raisi’s comments seem to echo those of Khamenei suggest that the supreme leader is pushing Iranians to vote for hardliners. If Raisi genuinely means what he says and is voted as the next president, then its possible that Iran won’t be getting the investment they need to upgrade their oil fields, which in turn will impact the level of output."

Thus, we may assume for this prediction that Iran is continuously seeking to increase its total revenue, to secure itself as a socially, politically and militarily powerful international actor. The first graph indicates that Iran’s main source of revenue is oil with only 11 percent of its GDP being obtained otherwise (fig. 1). Additionally, to further understand the importance of oil to the economy of Iran, recent studies have shown that since the lifting of the P5 imposed sanctions on Iran in 2016 - initially imposed due to its threatening nuclear program (Labott, 2015) – its oil exports have tripled (Egan, 2017). With a current crude oil production of approximately 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd) (fig. 2), researchers seek to find out whether Iran’s monthly oil production will exceed the 4 million bpd mark by the beginning of 2018. The following will provide an insight into whether these numbers are actually achievable. According to the senior consultant of research for JBC Energy, these numbers are only achievable if Iran’s technological capacities to extract crude oil are modernized (Egan, 2017). Relying heavily on foreign interest, Iran has therefore composed the Iran Petroleum Contract. Its terms state that there will be an increase in profits obtainable by foreign investors and the guarantee of revenue due to a newly developed risk service (Willn, 2015). Herewith, Iran is aiming to cover its issue of outdated extracting technology: a profound hurdle to achieving reach the newly set mark. However, as argued by O’Donnell, not all terms have been ‘spelled out’ fully yet, due to Iran’s fear of foreign investments causing troubles in regards to social security through instances such as job-loss for local workers etc. (Egan, 2017). It is important to note however that Iran has strong geostrategic interests in the Middle East, especially in regards to the sectarian war in Syria (Gause, 2017). Simply put, more investments imply greater oil revenues and greater oil revenues lead to more money: a needed means for the feasibility of Iran’s geostrategic interests. As Iran is ranked by the CIA as the 16th most prominent international oil exporter its exports are far below those of its competitors Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (""The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency"", 2017). Thus, in order to boost its power in and over unstable parts of the region, I would like to stress that it will be unlikely for Iran to oppose foreign interest. In fact, only recently Iran has “vowed to increase” oil exports to buyers in the European Union (Levit, 2017)., providing an insight into its willingness to rise through the ranks and to turn a blind eye to possible social security issues. In sum, the outdated infrastructure and technology to extract crude oil are leading Iran to attract foreign investors. With an influx of investors, the country is promised an increase in oil production, and foremost an increase in profit. Even though the presence of foreign companies may imply precarious working conditions for the Iranian oil labourers, Iran’s geostrategic interests display that Iran may be willing to overlook this social issue. Additionally, as the current number of barrels produced per month has already reached 3.8 million – and noting that we are only in the first third of 2017 – we may assume Iran to be exceeding the 4 million mark before the end of the year."

According to the Iranian Minister of Petroleum, Bijan Zangeneh, “Iran has plans to raise production of oil and gas from the joint field to levels higher than that of Qatar” (http://www.nioc-intl.ir/WebSiteEn/Pages/News1.aspx) In relation to what Iran will do later on in the year: there was an article published on Platts on the 22nd March 2017, in reference to Saudi Arabia, Iran and production cuts; “Geopolitical rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran may be headed for another OPEC showdown as the producer group enters negotiations over extending oil production cuts in force since January” “Any move to rein in Iran’s production is likely to be met with significant resistance, experts say.” Given the improvement in Iran’s oil production since January 2016, it can only be expected that any member, especially Saudi Arabia, telling Iran to rein in their production will not be taken lightly. (http://www.platts.com/latest-news/oil/london/saudi-arabia-may-insist-on-iran-oil-output-cuts-26691454) This might lead to an interesting period between now and June, when the original agreement ends. Last April, when OPEC attempted to construct a production cut deal, Saudi Arabia and Iran could not level with each other. “Iran wanted an exemption while it recovered from sanctions which prompted Saudi Arabia to withdraw from negotiations”. (http://www.platts.com/latest-news/oil/london/saudi-arabia-may-insist-on-iran-oil-output-cuts-26691454). In September, the OPEC members came back together in Algiers, some more willing to cut production, and negotiations were ongoing for 3 months, until November 30th when the agreement was signed. Coming back to what is happening now, if we are seeing Iran and Saudi Arabia heading for the same show down, there might be a period where there is no deal in place, allowing Iran (and other members) to produce at volumes they choose and are capable of doing."

Iran's economy is less dependent on oil compared to Saudi Arabia - therefore, Saudi Arabia cannot force Iran to cut production by raising its own.

Iran is actively looking to diversify and expand their customer base, especially in Europe, and have already sold oil cargoes to companies such as BP, Total (Iran's exports to France increased 57% m-o-m in September'16, all of which goes to Total), Repsol (Spain), Petrogal (Portugal), Iplom (Italy) etc. Iranian crude oil is appealing to European buyers due to competitive pricing compared to crudes from Russia and the Persian Gulf (platts.com). India and China are still the main buyers for Iranian crude oil - with India importing 602,456 b/d in September (up from 458,880 b/d in August) and their GDP forecasted to grow 7.2% in 2017 (OPEC MOMR October'16) , oil imports are likely to increase too. Also need to consider the influence of the upcoming OPEC meeting (as Iran is a member state). It was mentioned early on when talks about freezing production by OPEC were made public that Iran would be exempt from the deal, along with Nigeria and Libya. However, it now seems that the Saudi Arabians want to cut Iran's production (as mentioned by previous forecasters), making it increasingly harder for OPEC to agree a deal on November 30th. There are also problems from Iraq who do not want to cap production at the level OPEC is offering on the basis that they need the money to fight ISIS - increasing fears that a deal will not be made. It is necessary for Iran to get investment in order to exceed 4 mb/d due to major maintenance work and necessary technology upgrades - with the lifting of sanctions, Iran is looking for foreign investors for 50 new upstream projects (a list of qualified companies will be published December 7th 2016)."
