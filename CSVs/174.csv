I can't see ""at-home workers who itemize"" as such a group. Firstly, fewer taxpayers than ever itemize. Secondly, most of any added expense of working from home has been borne by employers rather than employees. So the tax expenditure for the added expenses is already being provided through lower corporate income tax revenue. Finally, the home office expense deduction has always been one of the most vigorously enforced and disputed of all individual taxpayer deductions even for self-employed individuals who must prove that they are incurring legitimate business expenses and using their home office exclusively for business. I suppose its slightly possible that Congress would toss out a little treat like the teacher expenses paid for from their own pockets front page deduction. But if that was such a great idea I think it would have happened already. I think the general mood now is that we don't need more fiscal stimulus in response to changes caused by the pandemic."
