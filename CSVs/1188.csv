That said, cuts don't make sense especially given low inflation. On monitary policy alone, rates should stay the same or go up, but there has been so much pressure as well as news of global economic woes including the EU who is talking rate change that I think hey'll be bullied into it. I will update my initial 1/28/71 prediction to give the fed chair the bennefit of the doubt, though. He also came out with a statement before the fed meeting saying the ""vaccine"" was a metaphor and not indicative of a plan. This could have been to scare markets that already priced in a cut so they have room to jump on the news of a cut and jerome is a hero, but i think this is wishful thinking."

Moreover, the Trump-Xi meeting in late June - that may shed more light on the trade wars - will have happened. Normally, the Fed waits longer between hinting at a change of course and actually doing it, so I don't assign a large probability of a cut, but the markets do - the CME futures assign a 78% probability.

I see the main risk to that view that (1) tariffs are reversed (could happen fast) (2) the cut doesn't happen until the Sept meeting. There are downside risks too though e.g. (1) Mexico tariffs if they happen (2) the prospect of car tariffs (2) equity market panic causing Fed to step in (3) further weakness in manufacturing/housing or consumer spending weakening further (4) the yield curve is inverted and the Fed worries about that. We'll learn a lot more in the Fed June meeting, if the statement and the 'dot plot' don't carry a large signal a rate cut is imminent then I think a surprise rate cut in July is becomes far less likely.
