In, fact, I do not believe schools should reopen in august for in-person classes. This question is VERY hard to predict because the concept of the spread of the disease and its prevalence is not directly related to the amount of testing. Looking at the chart many of the states that have the highest fatality rate were those hardest-hit earliest. We know deaths lag by 3--5 weeks, at least, after a spike in new cases is observed. However, with the most recent problem areas infections in younger people seem more prevalent, as well as more testing overall, which both lower the measured fatality rate."
