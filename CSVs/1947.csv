It has also been reported that the FBI wanted to investigate the foundation but the Justice Dept. chose not to. Although Clinton managed to avoid self-incrimination during the email investigation, their might be a slight chance that more could emerge that is very damaging. It might even occur after she's elected -- hello President Kaine. It seems unlikely that this would occur before Nov. 8, '16 though. I'm slightly lowering my probability estimate she'll be indicted by DOJ before then."

So for all we know they could already be building a case against Hillary and prepping a grand jury for the trial. My personal theory was that the timing of this is not coincidental. The e-mail controversy became public in March 2015 and there was ample time to bring up charges before she managed to: 1. delete >90% of the all the emails that contained classified information and provide only personal 'innocent' emails. 2. blame her assistants that they were the ones who didn't handle the servers and the communications properly. 3. cherry-pick and provide the authorities only the emails she wanted them to see (c. 5-6%) So they delayed this event as much as they could in order to reach the 'immune' status she currently enjoys because of wallstreet investment banks lobby and other organizations: https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cid=N00000019&cycle=Career In this way she would clear all charges against her in a way only possible through this particular circumstances. If she didn't enjoy her current status I believe situation would be much different. Also these sort of proceedings are largely decided by Loretta Lynch ( Bill's old friend, whom she owes). This hurts her chances for the presidential election but she still escapes unscarred a situation that would translate to 10 - 15 years of prison time under different circumstances. Thus my forecast of 0%."

The question asks whether Hillary Clinton will be indicted. There are multiple ways to get a defendant in front of a judge, but the question narrows those options to one: the indictment. Neither a deal between Clinton and the government in lieu of an indictment nor the DOJ charging Clinton with a non-indictable offense will resolve the question. Obviously, Clinton will not be indicted if the FBI investigation fails to uncover evidence of a crime. Assuming the FBI does recommend an indictable offense, keep in mind that an indictment comes from a grand jury and *only* a grand jury. The DOJ may accept the FBI’s recommendation but that still does not mean Clinton has been indicted. The DOJ must take the additional steps of empaneling a grand jury and presenting the evidence of her alleged crimes to them. The grand jury would then vote to “true bill” (indict) or “no bill” (not indict) on each of the potential crimes presented. Usually, a grand jury does what the DOJ wants, but that is more of a factor that grand jury proceedings are one-sided and the DOJ determines what to present rather than the grand jury simply rubber stamping the indictment. One fact we do not know is whether a grand jury has already been empaneled. If they are already hearing testimony and reviewing evidence, then the process would be further along. Some of the right-leaning media outlets seem to believe one has been empaneled. I have not found anything concrete to support their claim but the DOJ will not comment or acknowledge ongoing grand jury proceedings."

The article basically states that based on past indictments, so far there does not appear to be any evidence that Hillary did anything serious enough to warrant an indictment. The deleting of emails is troublesome, but legally very difficult to prosecute because Hillary's lawyers did the separating. Does anyone think Hillary would be dumb enough to just delete emails and hope for the best without thinking it through and getting the best legal advice possible to help her political career while avoiding prosecution? Hillary may be many things, but she is not dumb."

FBI is part of the DOJ which answer to the Democratic president so why not get this sorted years ago? This is the least opportune time to have a candidate under FBI investigation. Also Hillary has serious difficulties defeating Mr Sanders in the primaries and she has historically high disapproval ratings. Hillary represents the old type of politician, she's not en vogue. Is Obama in fact clearing a path for Biden or Sanders to replace Hillary? This election represents a clear break from business as usual, this is a rebellion coming from the serfs that are demanding a change. The GOP has embraced the change with Trump, however reluctantly, but the Democrats haven't, Hillary is business as usual in regards to politicians, besides her gender. Using the outside view in this case is worthless in my opinion."

Between 1945 and the present according to wikipedia 7 cabinet members were involved in scandals. Of those 42% were convicted (the others weren't indicted).
24992,2016-05-21T23:24:34Z,1,[1.0],[1.0],Base Rate. I calculated the base rate by looking at political scandals involving cabinet members (wikipedia) since WWII. I made some assumptions to make the calculations easier. There were 14 presidential terms. In each term there were 12 (under Truman) to 16 (under obama) cabinet members. During this time 7 cabinet ministers were involved in scandals and 3 were convicted of crimes. So I calculated my base rate as 3 convictions/14 cabinet members*14 terms= 1.5%

Furthermore, I think that an indictment would create a total sh*tstorm, and would thus be unlikely for an offense that was at all borderline indictable, and that investigators would want especially strong evidence to indict her. However, not all information is out there, and it is possible that some information that is being hidden will reveal indictable offenses, especially since such info seems like the most likely kind of information she would want to keep private for as long as possible (i.e., she is motivated to keep precisely the information that would be needed to indict her private, and so any remaining private information has a higher likelihood of revealing something indictable than the information that has thus far been made public)."

23833,2016-04-12T23:40:21Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"Opearing on the assumption that a case for indictment would be based on 1) the use of personal email breaking federal law or 2) the distribution of classified info, here's my rationale. While it's clear she clearly broke procedure, the argument that she broke federal law is weaker. If she is indicted, she could prevail and then she would look like a strong victim, which would help her case. The classified argument doesn't hold up because the docs were classified after they were shared. However, if it could be shown that she did distribute docs that she knew to be classified at the time, then I would expect to see an indictment, which is where the 10% comes in."
23830,2016-04-12T23:17:18Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"Given that the emails in question were not considered classified until after the fact, the case already seems weak to me. While the number of officials using private email servers is low, the number of officials using private email addresses is high, and that speaks to more people misunderstanding the insecure nature of email than anything else. Ironically, Clinton's choice to host her own server could have been seen as an attempt to beef up her email security, not the opposite. The bottom line is the intent question: did Clinton intend to pose security risks with her private email server? I highly doubt it. She made a mistake, and she has admitted to it, but if you are looking for proof of some nefarious intent on her part, I don't think you are going to find it."

Remember how Lois Lerner has never been prosecuted for her emails showing she conspired to investigate groups for political purposes? Remember how once upon a time people actually hoped Obama would prosecute Bush for war crimes? No organization can be expected to police itself.

First of all, as far as I can tell, there has never been an indictment against a current Presidential candidate, let alone the front-runner, and I find it very hard to believe this trend will suddenly fail now. Second, while it seems like there's some evidence that she did receive or transmit e-mails that some in the investigation are deeming to be classified, it's very unclear as to whether they were marked as such at the time, which makes the case harder to make. The definition of ""classified"" also seems rather fuzzy. Finally, I don't see any evidence that she willfully disclosed any of the information in the e-mails to a third party who was not cleared, vis a vis the previously indicted General Petraeus. I think it's far, far more likely that if things look bad she will simply be forced to step down from the campaign, most likely in some kind of face saving way behind the scenes."
