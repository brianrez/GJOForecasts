Although Fannie and Freddie's regulator is supportive of the move and pushing for it to happen before JAN 21, he cannot do so without Munichin's approval. It appears the Treasury Sec is happy to let the Biden administration make the decision on the consent order."

Right now, any profits from those entities is forwarded to the Treasury. Also, there are too many upper-echelon members of the Democrat Party that benefit from their continued relationship with those two entities. This will make it darn near impossible to allow those entities to return to their pre-2008 status."
