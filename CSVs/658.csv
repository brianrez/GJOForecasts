Coups became a frequent means to seize power, and democratic election results were often diminished. There were 13 successful coups, the most recent of which took place in 2014, led by General Prayut Chan-o-cha, who is in charge of the current government. Unlike other constitutional monarchies like the U.K. or Japan, the Thai monarchy has a robust role in domestic politics. Hence, the military junta in Thailand has relied on the royal sovereign’s approval as one of the sources of its legitimacy, and democracy was sidelined as a core value. Because public demands do not necessarily challenge the legitimacy of the government, calls for democracy were more easily overlooked."" https://thediplomat.com/2021/03/can-southeast-asia-follow-south-koreas-democratization-model/ It may happen, but even though protests intensified in the past few days, it's unlikely to happen by 23 April 2021."

From the Economist “Meanwhile, the prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led the coup in 2014 in which the army (ostensibly in defence of the monarchy) seized power, grows less conciliatory by the day. In particular, a draconian law against “insulting” the monarchy has been dusted off and used against more than a score of activists. Mr Prayuth’s star, admittedly, is waning with the king, not least for letting the protests wax so dramatically. But if Mr Prayuth is dismissed as a scapegoat, it will surely be because King Vajiralongkorn wants his successor to take a harder line.”"

This week pro-democracy protesters clashed with police and royalists in front of parliament. Police used tear-gas and water cannon (around 50 people were injured and a handful treated for gunshot wounds). Inside, MPs debated constitutional reforms—including curbs on royal powers and the army’s dominant role in politics, such as the students demand. The government has a majority and, being royalist and pro-army, it rejected progressive proposals to change the charter that it wrote in 2017. Parliament looks likely to establish a face-saving committee that will fiddle with the constitution but keep the old guard in power. Ultra-royalists continue calling for a coup to protect the monarchy. High-living King Vajiralongkorn remains constitutionally “enthroned in a position of revered worship”. But under his reign, the monarchy’s hold on people’s imagination is much reduced. Today Prayuth Chan-ocha, the prime minister, warned protesters the state would use “all the pertaining laws” against them. The country is entering risky territory“"
