See: CSIS report and data (https://www.csis.org/analysis/military-police-and-rise-terrorism-united-states). In 2020, the number of domestic terrorist attacks and plots increased to its highest level since at least 1994, though fatalities were relatively low. Across all perpetrator ideologies, there were 110 domestic terrorist attacks and plots in 2020—an increase of 45 incidents since 2019 and 40 more incidents than in 2017, the year which previously had the most terrorist attacks and plots since the beginning of the data set. Despite this sharp increase in terrorist activity, the number of fatalities from domestic terrorist attacks was at its lowest level since 2013. Five people were killed in terrorist attacks in 2020—an 86 percent decrease from 2019, when 35 individuals died in terrorist attacks."

I think it is important to realize that this is a two part question. 1) will an event occur that causes 10 or more fatalities before 1 Jan 2022 and 2) will that event be labeled domestic terrorism. Part 2 is tricky to forecast because terrorism is a political label for a specific type of crime, it's easier to predict a crime rate than to predict how policy makers will react to a specific criminal act."

With the issue of deplatforming of the right, which may leave some very armed people very pissed, with mental health issues alleviated by Covid and extreme polarisation, I'd say that the probability should be much higher. I'd say 70% for the year, discount to 64% for the time passed."
97615,2021-02-11T15:39:27Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"Since 1995, there have only been a handful of domestic terrorist attacks in the US - numbering only about 10-15. However, they have been increasing in frequency with a peak in 2015 (Charleston Church, San Bernardino, Orlando). Notably, only four of these have resulted in 10 or more fatalities (Oklahoma, Orlando, Pittsburgh, El Paso Walmart)."

In the past 100 months, there have been the following incidents I could find that would have triggered a Yes outcome: 1) August 2019: El Paso Walmart. (There was also the Dayton shooting that month, but it's unclear whether it was intended to influence government policy or action.) 2) October 2018: Pittsburgh synagogue 3) June 2016 Orlando Pulse nightclub 4) December 2015 San Bernadino attack"

11447,2021-02-11T08:17:01Z,1,[7.0],[7.0],Recent history and current inflamed tensions would seem to argue for a relatively high probability - last 5 years would appear to get you to a 40% probability and arguably tensions are higher now. However realistically I think a longer view would give a better base at something a bit below 10%. Actually think tensions will fall a bit so going with 7%. Crowd at 5% seems a little low given unfortunately the casualty figure is not that high in a very armed society.
98293,2021-02-11T06:47:50Z,1,[20.0],[20.0],"An act of domestic terrorism is quite likely as the recent history of the US demonstrates: in the 2010s it happened at least annually and in some years few cases per year. Last year 2020 is exceptional because of the movement restrictions. But 2021 should be more ""normal"". However the question above also mentions a condition of 10 or more fatalities and that reduces the number of valid cases dramatically."

Only seven in the last 50 years, making for a seven percent chance each decade. The fact that the FBI and DHS are on high alert to White Supremacist plotting is to me a hopeful sign that they are monitoring known threats, making it less likely that those attacks will eventuate. Covid also makes it more difficult to find venues with large crowds for attacks. That will change as the year progresses, but genuine terrorist attacks are usually the result of careful planning and rehearsals, all of which take many months."

98236,2021-02-10T22:41:12Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],10 or more fatalities is the reason my probability estimate is so low. If it said 3 or less I would have put it at 50% at the least.
1056,2021-02-10T21:08:28Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"Interesting question. I assume the perpetrator(s) must actually identify their motive, or a pattern of behavior that can be construed as constituting a motive (as in the El Paso, or Oklahoma City, or Pittsburgh massacres). However, I note that the Cornell definition is:"
98108,2021-02-10T20:56:05Z,1,[22.0],[22.0],"Since 2000 there have been 7 acts of domestic terrorism that have resulted in 10 or more fatalities. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_the_United_States#2020%E2%80%93present) This gives me a base rate of 35% for the chance that there will be an act of domestic terrorism in the United States resulting in 10 or more fatalities in a given year. I will reduce this by 3% (roughly 1/12) since the month of January has already passed so I am now at 32%. I will reduce the forecast by another 5% to 27% due to some places of worship, restaurants, and nightclubs, which are frequent targets for acts of domestic terrorism, being closed for COVID-19. The heightened level of security in the United States likely makes it more difficult to plan and carry out an attack so I will further reduce my forecast by 8% to 19%. Lastly, I will slight increase my forecast by 3% given the increased chance of a domestic terrorist attack by a white supremacist group for a final forecast of 22%."
