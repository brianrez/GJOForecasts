Throughout all of the forecasts that I have made, I have thought that this is what the cereals price index would be. After running a regression and analyzing specific data sets, I am more confident in selecting this interval for the price index. This is because my regression showed that there was a positive relation between the amount of cereals produced and the cereal price index. So this means that as the amount of cereals produced increases that the Cereals Price Index also increases. According to the US Department of Agriculture, ""this month, there are no changes to the 2022/23 domestic supply of corn, sorghum or oats - while barley imports are up slightly from January."" (USDA, Feb 10. 23). According to the research that I have conducted, the production of cereals is not varying much from January so I think it is safe to assume that the FAO cereals price index will be relatively the same for February. This is why I think that the FAO cereals price index will be between 140 and 160."

There were not extreme weather patterns in areas crucial for the grain/cereals economy, and major countries such as the United States did not see economic recessions. Therefore, I am predicting with 82% confidence that the FAO Cereals Price Index will be between 140 and 160 in the month of February. In the chance that an extreme change does happen to the price index, I predict with 15% certainty that it will be between 120 and 140, and 3% certainty that it will be between 160 and 180."

For example, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations published an article titled, Global Food Prices Decline Further in January. According to this article, various segments of the FAO food price index are decreasing (such as vegetable oils, dairy and sugar) but that the price for cereal is neither decreasing or increasing. This is a statement that I have found is supported by various sources. It is because of this that I think the FAO cereal price index for February would be similar to what it was in January. Resulting from this, I am 89% confident that the FAO Cereals Price Index for February 2022 will be between 140.0 and 160.0."

From December 2022 to January 2023, there was a slight increase in the FAO cereals price index. From looking at how the value fluctuated in 2022, there is a pattern of their being an increase followed by a decrease. Due to this, I think that the price value for February will be an increase from January, making the value between 140 and 160."

However, in terms of an outlook to Feb 2023 I have a different take (I think prices will rise and may surpass the peak of 169.5 seen in April). I'm pessimistic on the mid-term effects of the cereal’s shortage issue stemming from the Ukrainian crisis and poor harvests globally. I think we will witness a whiplash effect upon the supply chain that begins to hit early 2023. I need to do more thinking about how all of this information fits together, and the probabilities, but this is my initial thinking and forecast."

My gut feeling is that the question will end up in bin 3, but I'm giving equal weight to bin 4 just in case things get out of control, and some weight on bin 5 just in case, as well. I think it would take even greater shocks than we have been seeing to push prices into bin 4 or higher, but maybe I'm wrong, and maybe such a shock might happen. Flocks of black swans lately."

If they only end up with 20% of the fuel they need, or 30% or even 50%, how are they going to plant 70% of their normal levels of crops overall? Adjusting my forecast a little higher."

The cereals index has trended upward since the pandemic started, and the war on Ukraine has bumped it up even higher. And the prospects for agricultural output and exports in the short and medium term in Ukraine don't look good, and exports from Russia are also curtailed. Wheat futures markets anticipate prices staying about at current levels until next summer, but wheat futures on those time scales tend to track whatever current prices are. So I take the futures prices with a grain of salt."
