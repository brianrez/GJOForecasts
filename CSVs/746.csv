Even after Nixon resigned, who Trump is often compared to, by opponents and critics, Texas voted for Carter. - Then I want to adjust my sentiment, by using the ""silent majority"" argument. Yes, there are many non-vocal Republicans in Texas as well as other states. The Democrats are on a roll these months, driven by covid and BLM movement. But, when it comes to voting day, in Texas that is a typical Republican stronghold, I believe there will be a re-concentration of Republicans on the ballot, that is not showing up on polls now (something like ""silent majority"" argument that you hear sometimes. I buy that. Republicans that would be less vocal than Democrats, it somehow makes sense to me). So I am adjusting to something like 80%-20% for Republicans. - Finally, the crowd will be somewhat more modest in their predictions I suppose, so I want to be more extreme and gamble myself some extra Brier points :)"
