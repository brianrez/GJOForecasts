When will Paul Ryan formally endorse Donald Trump for president?,2016-05-20T18:30:07Z,2016-06-02T21:00:15Z,Before the Republican National Convention,"['Not before the general election', 'Before the Republican National Convention', 'At or after the Republican National Convention']",['US Politics'],356,654,181,237,"Speaker Ryan met with Donald Trump, but stopped short of formally endorsing his candidacy (USA Today, Washington Post). For previous examples of endorsement, see: Chris Christie (CNN), Rick Scott (Politico), Jeff Sessions (Washington Post). Endorsements are also recorded by FiveThirtyEight and Trump's campaign. Recommended Questions: Will an independent or third-party candidate win at least 5% of the popular vote in the U.S. presidential election? Who will win the Republican Party nomination for the US presidential election? Will the Republican candidate for president win the party's nomination on the first ballot, at the party's convention in July?",https://www.gjopen.com/questions/205-when-will-paul-ryan-formally-endorse-donald-trump-for-president
