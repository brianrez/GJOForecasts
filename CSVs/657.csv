I don't see a reason to believe a small uptick is more likely than a small downtick, so those get equal chances.

The big factor is the fact that no new coronavirus relief has been passed. I assume the CARES act played a role in the strong retail recovery, and that could wane by the holidays. On the other hand, people may have been saving some of that money or they could substitute retail spending for other activities during the holidays.
