On Mojo [1], ""Domestic"" refers to gross box-office revenue from North America (U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico), ""International"" covers the rest of the world. The objective of the questions is to estimate the total domestic box office gross for Tenet as of 8 September 2020, according to Box Office Mojo? So 5 days domestic box office. My strategy is 1/ to have first an outside view looking at historical data for similar movies (Nolan previous movies for instance) to get the average domestic gross in the first 5 days after release. Previous Nolan movie in US Inception with release date July 15, 2010 (EMEA, APAC) has a domestic gross for the 5 first days (given it was out on Friday 16th-> we effect) of + 83 million [2] Interstellar released on November 5, 2014 (EMEA, Domestic) $49,661,813 [3] 2/ Regress from Europe to get insight on how this specific movie is performing. Chris Nolan's Tenet is off to a very solid start, topping all 41 overseas territories in which it opens, provided it indeed gets the post-opening legs that Warner Bros. is banking upon for global box office success. In normal times, a $53 million overseas launch (including $5 million in IMAX) for a film as big as Chris Nolan’s Tenet would be, at the very least, somewhat disappointing. 3/ consider the labor day factor here At this outside view stage I will have 40% > 80 million and 60% < 80 million."

Tenet has been debut for the international audience for about one week and earned $55m international box office in total (data as of 9/3/2020). Without considering the coronavirus situation, since we are five days until the 9/8 deadline, the expected domestic box office is 55 * 5 /7 = $40m. On Sep 3rd, my expected movie theater capacity is at most 50% because of the hard coronavirus in-door activity limit. Besides, the biggest movie theater chains in the U.S. were acting in about 30% capacity on August 20th, which serves as a bottom line (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/20/coronavirus-amc-regal-and-cinemark-prepare-to-reopen-in-the-us-after-five-month-shutdown.html). Thus, the expected domestic box office is then $40*30% to $40*50%, which gives me 12m to 20m. I left a 1% margin in the bins below and above 1-80m margin for special scenarios, such as a sudden shut-down of all movie theaters/Tenet was much more welcomed by the American audience than the international ones."

A counterpoint to this is that the reviews for the movie are quite good (though not stellar by Nolan's standards) so I do not count out the minute chance that Americans make it out to see the movie."

Inception, Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk have had $82.6m, $61.8m, and $64.3m as their opening 5-day domestic grosses (data from Box Office Mojo). However, obviously COVID has drastically reduced sales expectations, with only 62% of theaters open and all with social distancing in place. Additionally, the fact that more than half of Americans are extremely unlikely to go to a movie theater a month after they reopen, makes it seem extremely unlikely that Tenet will exceed $80 million (https://fortune.com/2020/09/03/tenet-us-movie-theaters-box-office-coronavirus-pandemic-release/). This lines up with analysts' forecast of about $25-35 million in opening week sales (https://www.boxofficepro.com/long-range-box-office-forecast-christopher-nolans-tenet/).

These net out to approximately $20k and $19k per theater respectively. AMC announced it is opening about 70% of movie theaters for release of Tenet. Some of these movie theaters (NJ, California) must open at 25% capacity, while theaters in populous states such as NY will not even open. If we make optimistic assumptions: average $20k per theater (same as Dunkirk, with what will likely be much less capacity), approximately 70% of theaters open (of which we assume 75% are operating at same capacities as in 2017), this gives us a revenue projection of $42mm.

Due to minimal competition, Tenent also will likely have a lengthy run. In 2020, gross is about 70% - 80% of total. Most recently, The New Mutants, an action horror sci-fi was released in theaters and earned $7MM opening weekend. With a similar genre, and more excitement around the film due to cast, director, and budget, we can expect Tenent to perform much higher. In 2017, Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk earned $188MM gross in the box office. With Americans hungry for things to do, ready for new movies, and theaters opening up, we can expect Tenent to perform much higher than The New Mutants, though not as high as it would have pre-pandemic as many are still staying home."

Some people won't see it due to covid, some people are dying to go out to a movie. I think only around 50% of people will have normal access to the theatres in their area, and so The opening week that this question includes will be about the same as a normal opening weekend. every opening weekend that grossed over 100 million was a superhero movie, or had some other cult following that this does not have (star wars, etc)"

However, August 14 looks like another option if it is delayed [1]. Given an August 14th release, I'd expect it to almost certainly gross below $80 million, possibly even under $1 million, though unlikely (~90% > 1 million). If we assume the August 14 date is fifty-fifty given a delay, with the other option being after Sept. 8, then the < 1 million probability becomes 20%. In the event of a July 17 release (~65%), then I'd say there's a 100% chance it exceeds $1 million, and there's a possibility that it exceeds $80 million, but I find this unlikely. However, a lot can change in 2-4 months so I'll bump up my estimate of above 80 to about 10% (given July 17 release). Therefore, greater than 80 has roughly 7%. I give 1% to 160-240 only because I think about how poorly I would've predicted today's events three and a half months ago."

Dunkirk made ~ 80 million domestic in about 1 week. Assuming they stick to the Jul 17 release date, that gives Tenet more than 1 month to do what Dunkirk did in one week — seems like theaters filling at 25% capacity is not too out of the question and Tenet won't be competing with anything. We don't have data on how willing people are to go to the theater, so I'm totally in the dark about that component. But I am somewhat optimistic about them sticking to the Jul 17 date. The website and twitter say so, Nolan seems to really want a theatrical release, and even if it gets pushed a month that still gives it time to make some money. I assign a significantly higher probability to the higher gross amounts (>160 million) than the crowd because I just don't know how consumer's willingness to go out and see a movie will change over the next few months. It seems unlikely, but if Tenet receives excellent press, is viewed as the only entertainment available, and theaters do a good job rolling out social distancing measures, it might be plausible that it does big numbers. We're simply bad at knowing how COVID and consumer behavior will progress more than 1 month out, so we should be more uncertain!"
