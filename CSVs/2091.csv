This is important b/c since the suspension, the market is down BIG, which means that far fewer companies will actually want to IPO right now. Also, w/ 3 months remaining till this question time runs out, there will be a delay between the time the ban is lifted and when the IPO actually launches trading. I've never been an i-banker, but just as a rough estimate given my limited research time available, I figure it'd take around a month from the time a ban is lifted to the time when the first IPO is actually launched. So I'm realistically asking if the ban will be lifted in the next 2 months. China likes to exert control, and I think they really think their logically control can get the markets to do what they want--look at their behavior w/r/t the renminbi. So I think they dont lift the ban in the next two months b/c the markets are still in the doldrums."
