The run-off election today pits Jon Ossoff, a 30-year-old documentary film-maker and former Democratic congressional aide, against Karen Handel, a veteran Georgia Republican. The contest has been supercharged by tens of millions of dollars in spending, much of it by outside groups who see it as a test of the parties’ prospects in the age of President Donald Trump. Oddly, neither candidate has been outspoken about the president, for fear of riling swing voters. The district, a stretch of mostly well-heeled Atlanta suburbs, was for decades safe Republican territory, but in November Mr Trump took it only by a whisker. Mr Ossoff narrowly missed an outright win in the poll’s first round, in April—but then the Republican field was crowded. Today’s contest will be close"

In the 18-candidate special election on April 18, Ossoff received 48 percent of the vote against Handel's runner-up total of 19.8 percent. Votes for Republican candidates, however, slightly outpaced votes for Democratic candidates, 51 to 49 percent. The special election became necessary when Tom Price (R) was confirmed to become the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
