In March its 737 MAX aircraft, its best-selling plane, was grounded by safety regulators around the world after two crashes in just five months killed 346 people. In May it revealed a fix for the software issues that contributed to those accidents. It hoped that the MAX would be ungrounded by July. But in the past few weeks that timetable has slipped. A new problem with its microprocessors emerged in late June, which will take months to fix. On Friday European aviation regulators revealed another new software fault with the aircraft. Authorities in America now do not want to unground the MAX until those in other countries also do. As a result carriers are already cancelling more flights this autumn. The rumour among airline executives is that the MAX may not get airborne again this year.“"
