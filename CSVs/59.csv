The addition of stud receiver Allen Robinson II, who has looked stellar in preseason, ensures the Rams will be very likely to win the division. Although the 49ers are coming off an NFC championship appearance, the uncertainty with second year QB Trey Lance means they will be a hit or a flop this season. The Cardinals are an enigma, but with stars like JJ Watt, Kyler Murray, and Deandre Hopkins, it is hard to write them off.
