The weather forecast is pretty poor throughout, and having read the WTC playing conditions (well, some of the 98 pages), overs can only be made up for interruptions (not slow over rates - DO NOT GET ME STARTED!). That said, it might be a rather stop/start affair, which might make it a little more difficult for the batsmen, so the draw is not as high a chance as it might be. The weather also suggests despite recent dry weather, there might be a bit of early assistance for the seam bowlers on Friday morning if the pitch is sweating under the covers. The Rose Bowl is historically one of the better grounds for spin, so NZ might have a tricky decision if they were to win the toss if there is a lot of cloud cover and rain in the air. One curious thing - if Friday is a complete washout, is the game still considered a 5d test? With the reserve day? The reason this matters is if it becomes a 4d game, the follow on is 150 not 200, which might impact the draw %. Tenuous perhaps. Either way, looking forward to the game."

Both sides have superb seam bowling attacks, each boast one of the best batsmen of this era (Kohli and Williamson). The fact this is a one off match means there is less opportunity for a side to recover from a bad day (e.g. 36 all out). I make NZ slight favourites, but only slight. India were badly mauled in a 2 test series in NZ last year, and they represent the closest conditions to English conditions. India won in Australia earlier in the year, despite one or two poor batting performances. However, New Zealand are already in England, and plan against England before this one-off game which means they will be battle hardened, and will be playing competitive cricket whilst the Indian team are in lockdown. The corollary is they may be jaded after two games against England - especially if the pitches are flat and the bowlers are forced to bowl a lot of overs (no laughing please - I realise England's batting is fragile)."

As a result, NZ will be better prepared and the English conditions will favour their bowlers. Few test matches go to a draw these days (faster scoring rates) but the english weather might play a part - although an extra reserve day has been included in event of rain."
