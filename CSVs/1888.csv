An early battle will be over the Brexit tab, made up largely of outstanding budgetary commitments and pension liabilities: the European Commission may demand up to €60bn ($64bn). Having done nothing to prepare British opinion for an exit charge, Mrs May can expect outrage from Britain’s slavering tabloids and restive MPs; that may limit her negotiating room. Expect a scrap, too, on the sequence of events. British negotiators want to open talks on a post-Brexit settlement, including a trade deal, before the terms of departure have been agreed upon—issues that Michel Barnier, the commission’s Brexit negotiator, wants to keep separate.

The new support for Brexit is the latest case of the old story of the British Establishment absorbing those it formerly opposed (the anti-EU ""bastards"") and essentially accepting their arguments. For the first time in decades the Conservative Party is united over Europe - while Labour is split. The Lib Dem Peers will try to delay as much as they can - but their party's marginal representation in the Commons now means they don't really have a leg to stand on. While the party that actually has been providing substantive opposition in the Commons - the Scots Nats - don't have any Lords.... It should go through as planned by May."

I am not at all sure she understands any of this. Any WTO country can has ""access"" to the EU single market so no deal is needed, what is important is being a member of the single market. The EU Single Market is a market to guarantee to free movement of Goods and Services, Capital and People, with the EU Court having sovereignty. Mrs May does not want the EU Court or the Free Movement, so presumably what she actually want is a trading deal with EU not the Single Market. This would seem to indicate a deal more similar to that between the EU and South Korea. Most experts on trade negotiations think it (a) unlikely that the EU is keen on the type of deal Mrs May wants (b) even if they are it would be very difficult to get an agreement and ratify it within the 2 year time frame between invoking A59 and Leaving the EU. This is why Ivan Rodgers was reporting that a UK EU deal of this sort would take a long time to sort out. Without repeating the arguments, it is easy sympathize with Ivan Rodgers (EU Ambassador who resigned). Mrs May seems to acting like someone who is sure she knows what she is doing, when those in a position to know are pretty sure she doesn't. (She does not know what she does not know.) People with this outlook tend to do things that are illogical. So she may well trigger A50 in the belief that a deal can be negotiated in 2 years in spite of the various EU elections. The UK Labour Party seems to be completely divided on almost every aspect of Brexit, some don't want any change to the Freedom of movement of people, but would be happy with no trade deal, other want to remain in the Customs Union but accept that the Freedom of Movement needs to be changed. As I noted in a previous forecast this muddle means each time the public are told what Mrs May thinks Bexit means the pound falls, to be followed a day or two later by a statement that the media have confused the markets by not explaining Mrs May's words correctly. The ""correction"" usually takes the form of saying that remaining in the Customers Union and Single Market have not been ruled out. The only conclusion is that Mrs May does not herself understand what she is saying means."

The EU has suggested that the 2 year leaving period that starts with A50 is in reality 18 months to negotiate plus 6 months for all parties (the EU, the EU Parliament and the nation states) to ratify and plan to implement. They have also pointed out that ideally the UK needs to have left the EU before the next EU Parliamentary elections due in May 2020. David Davis has pointed out that until the French and German elections are out of the way no substantive negotiations regarding the UK's future relationship with the EU can start. May has repeated her aim to invoke A50 before 31st March. If these 3 sets of dates are taken together we would have A50 by 31st Mar 2017, but no substantive negotiations would start until (probably) the end of September 2017. As the 2 year period would end in February 2019, the negotiations would need to be complete by September 2018 (to give the 6 months to ratify). This seems to show that the period to do the negotiations would be September 2017 to September 2018, which is of course 1 year."

There does not seem to have been any rush to get the approval ahead of the Supreme Court judgement that is expected in January (no one is suggesting that it would be wrong to get Parliament's approval regardless of the Supreme Court saying Yes or No). This suggests that (a) Mrs May and the Brexit team are not ready (b) that Mrs May is fully aware that A50 before the French election would force French Presidential candidates to appear more anti-Brexit in order to to seem more Pro-France, which would not help Mrs May. So my conclusion is that Mrs May's plan (if it can be called that) is to hope that ""events"" give her the excuse to put off A50 until after the French elections and possibly until after the German elections. On the whole the Brexit news seems to be that every weeks brings a new idea of what sort of Brexit is possible, followed a few days later with the reasons why the idea will not works (e.g. today's idea is to pay to keep the existing trade relationship, tomorrow it will be pointed out that to do so will require obeying the European Court of Justice rulings, and accept the free movement of people; both taboos.) In fact any trade deal (CETA, NAFTA, TTIP, WTO) requires some type of court to settle disputes, so its unclear how Brexit can be pro-FreeTrade but against having a dispute settlement body."

Either the UK Government is totally inept or trying to be cunning. Surely they must have anticipated the High Court ruling. The former Attorney General within days of the Referendum was saying that invoking A50 required the approval of Parliament, so why did Mrs May not start obtaining the approval. Why has she wasted 4 months and appears to be planning to waste at least another month (possibly 2) appealing the High Court? Why is the consolidation of 1972 into English law being put off until after A50? Logically it should be done first. Delaying it seems to offer another possibility of intervention by the High Court on the ground that triggering A50 but failing to pass the Consolidation before automatic Brexit 2 years later would result in many laws being subject to neither the EU Court of Justice nor any English Court. There is no guarantee that having triggered A50 that the Consolidation Act would be able to be passed. Nissan may be happy with Mrs May saying ""Trust me"", I am not sure that the High Court would. It is all very well to tell the EU that she is sticking to the timetable, but does she know that ""events"" will force her to miss the date. It makes no sense to trigger A50 just before the French election, it just means 3 months of zero progress. Are all her recent actions aimed at zero progress? Was the selection of Heathrow for a 3rd runway knowing that it is incompatible with meeting pollution targets, just a way of not building anything? She has form. At the Home Office she made a lot of noise about reducing immigration from outside the EU, but in 6 years actually achieved nothing. Maybe her plans are to talk things up, but avoid the tough decisions needed to deliver. And Brexit is going to be tough to deliver."

As the hard line Brexiteers only make up a small percentage of MPs and even fewer Lords there is bound to be a lot of argument as to what voters in the referendum were really voting for. At a minimum one would expect Parliament to take a view as whether priority should be given to protecting the UK economy, giving the UK total control over immigration, or having no external court able to rule on breaches of trade and migration disputes. This could take several months to get through Parliament. By that time the folly of invoking A50 just before French elections could cause Parliament to set a more sensible timetable for A50.

The only arrangements that appear to match his description would be the EU Customs Unions (on a similar basis to Turkey) or the EU Single Market (like Norway). He also spoke of the need to have similar arrangements for other industries and services. He and May appear to have done a remarkable job of convincing Nissan, that a few weeks previously had said it would not invest in its UK plant without compensation in case tariffs were introduced on Brexit. Bearing in mind that compensation for tariffs is illegal under WTO and EU rules, the UK government seems to be very committed now to the Single Market or the Customs Union. In both cases there exists a more or less standard agreement to sign up to, which it is unlikely that the rest of the EU would object to. But as May and Clerk must be aware both these options preclude the EU making 3rd party trade deals without EU agreement and they both require that the EU Courts enforce the EU set rules. It does not really seem feasible that any agreement like Clerk was describing could operate without a common set of rules and a Court of some kind to deal with disputes. We know the sort of time it takes to create a bespoke trade deal (7 to 10 years seems typical). The UK will (probably) only have two years to do its deal with the EU. So I would suggest that the only possible deal that could be done in 2 years would be to take an existing EU deal such as the Customs Union or Single Market. Maybe with the long term objective of gradually changing it. But in order to do that I am sure that the UK could only get a variation of the Freedom of Movement for Workers and would still need to contribute to the EU budget. The alternative would be no deal at all. Would May be willing to tell Nissan and the motor industry and any other industries that had also been ""assured"" that there would be no financial or other tariffs that the UK had turned down an offer from the EU for staying in the Customs Union or Single Market? How could the UK ""compensate"" them? I would not like to be in her shoes if she did not bring a tariff free deal from Brussels. I think ""assuring"" Nissan that May can deliver has made it impossible not to. And that only an existing agreement can be used in the time frame. That said it would be better to get the uncertainty out of the way and start the process by March. As the issue of immigrants has already blurred into not counting the skilled, graduates, students and vital unskilled workers, it should not be impossible to sort out an acceptable fudge."

The Pro-Brexit winner's share of the vote was 25% less than Cameron got in 2015. Its the same as the percentage the Conservatives got in 2001, when Cameron was first elected there, but in that General Election Labour got a huge majority. Obviously a Byelection is not a General Election, but the the Government has only a small majority and there must be a lot of Conservative MPs who are worried about the next election. Governments tend to get fewer votes in Byelections, but new Governments don't usually loose popularity so quickly. The fact that this Government has lost votes indicates that what is doing is not popular with Conservative voters. In these circumstances MPs become keener on improving their election chances than blindly supporting the Government. Crashing the economy has not previously been a popular policy with Conservative voters, so MPs will want to ensure that Brexit is done so as not to cause too much damage. More reports from the BBC on divisions and confusion within the UK Government. It is reported that there is talk of not only allowing skilled workers access to work in the UK, removing students from the migration figures, but also allowing unskilled worker access to the UK in order to maintain the supply of workers in areas such as agriculture and care homes. If these ideas are followed through its difficult to see how this will satisfy those who voted for Brexit in order to cut immigration. The BBC also reports that May is not happy that the Brexiteers have been briefing the media that Hammond has been pushing to protect the economy and getting in their way, and that the Brexiteers are behind schedule with their planning, with the result that A50 will be trigger as late as possible in March 2017.

As I understand it A50 gives a country up to 2 years to complete its negotiations to leave the EU. At the end of the two years EU treaties shall cease to apply to the Leaving country. Therefore it appears to be the case that if the EU invoked A50 in March 2017 all EU Treaties will cease to apply by March 2019 at the latest. I would have thought that if the EU Treaties were just allowed to lapse there would be legal chaos. Hence the need for the Consolidation Law to convert EU law into UK law. But the only way to guarantee that the Consolidation Law is in fact passed before the UK leaves the EU is to pass it before triggering Article 50. Not passing the Consolidation Law before triggering Article 50 appears to be relying on future legislation, which the government may expect to pass, but that there is no way of knowing will pass. Therefore it would appear that in order to protect UK Citizens as well as Citizens of other UK countries legally residing in the UK (who presumably could after March 2017 be classified illegal aliens) A50 has to come after the Consolidation bill. I would assume that many other rights that are provided by EU law would disappear. It does not sound right for the Royal Prerogative (A50) to be used in such a way that Parliament is forced to pass future legislation like it or not. This seems to negate the point of having a Parliament. http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-European-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/15/new-alliances-oppose-hard-brexit"

Theresa May has signaled her intentions of walking towards a hard Brexit—prioritizing immigration regulation over access to the single market, favoring an earlier article 50 trigger. The UK has to be able to strike 3rd countries deals as soon as possible. It will not be able to benefit from the trade agreements the EU has. 2. Half of Theresa May’s team of negotiators with the EU consists of pro-Brexit ministers. 3. On the 17th we will know whether the London court will allow the PM to trigger the article w/t passing it through the House of Lords and House of Commons. It is true that many MP are pro-EU, but they need a serious conviction and reason to hold off the trigger—a second referendum is the only one. By the words of Donald Tusk : “A hard Brexit or no Brexit at all!” a. A deal similar to the one with Norway is improbable as it involves the movement of people the UK voted against. b. A series of bilateral deals similar to the ones with Switzerland are also improbable as it sets a very bad precedent for other countries that in the future may leave the EU. c. The leader of the Labor party made it clear he will not stand in the way of Brexit 4. The proposed draft bill of Scotland’s 2nd referendum for independence is irrelevant: Scotland would be worse off as its industry is tighter to the other states of the UK then to the EU. 47% of Scottish are in favour of staying in the UK vs 38% against. More arguments need to be heard, but if it is anything like Ireland, Scotland will suffer more from the Brexit than any other country in the EU and Britain itself."

As UK government debt continues to rise and the UK current account continues to deteriorate it will need to find overseas buyers wiling to buy new gilts. The likely effect of a lower pound will make imports more expensive, but export volumes will only increase if either production for the domestic are diverted to exports or production increases. Production will not increase if access to the EU as an export market post Brexit is uncertain. In theory consumption of imports could decrease due to the higher prices, but many of the imports are not easily substituted for domestic production, and many if they can be substituted can only do so if they are not exported instead.

This has spooked the currency markets and most of the business community (especially that part that trades in Europe). Other statement made at the Conservative Party Conference have indicated that the government appears to be trying to change the direction of the Conservative Party. The cumulative effects have penned up cracks between the views of the government and some Conservative MPs. Coupled with this Labour has appointed Keir Starmer as the Shadow Brexit Minister. These developments appear to be adding impetus the idea that Mrs May cannot be left to dictate the UK's objectives as to what type of Brexit the UK wants and then to lead the negotiations with the EU with the public and MPs denied any input or veto on what the final deal entails. Today several political commentators have expressed doubts that Mrs May's tactics are sustainable. Starmer talked of raising the matter in Parliament. Given that the government has a majority of only 12 it is possible that parliament could demand its say and delay May's timetable. May seems vulnerable as she has also raised policies not directly linked to Brexit, that while popular with party members were not party policy and that are not popular with all her MPs (e.g. Grammar Schools, reporting how many foreigners are employed by each company). She has had her 100 days of honeymoon. It will now be business as usual trying to get all her MPs to follow her when they are not at all happy that they want to go there. If she adds more contentious issues to the mix, such as where to build a new runway for a London airport she could see her hold on the party slip. Once an MP gets into the habit of disagreeing with their party leader its difficult to hold them back."

UK voters have traditionally been very sceptical about the claims of Populist politicians. The UK Conservative Party this week redefined itself as a Populist party.

Also it is reported that the Great EU Repeal Act that is supposed to follow A50 might run into constitutional problems from the Lords and also because under the devolution agreement with Scotland it might require that the Scottish Parliament also agrees to the repeal as many Acts of the Scottish Parliament make reference to the 1972 act that is to be repealed.

It has been suggested that saying that the UK is prepared for no access to EU markets could be just a negotiating ploy, but her problem is that by suggestion that this could be a likely outcome has had other consequences. The pound has resumed its fall and businesses that can relocate are no doubt pursuing plans to obtain the premises inside the EU, and affected business that can't easily more plant and machinery will have stopped investing in the UK. The effect of the talk of plans to replace foreign workers with British workers although not yet implemented, added to the drop in incomes as expressed in Euros or Dollars of the foreign workers, will be starting to effect the recruitment and retention of these workers - working in the UK for less money compared to other countries, while be made to feel unwelcome is not great for attracting talent. We are seeing a significant split in what what government ministers and others are saying the Brexit vote was for. One group is saying its about Free Markets, Free Trade and against protectionism, the other group are saying its about protect people from Globalisation. Its very unclear how the border with Ireland can be kept fully open if the UK is outside the EU Customs Union. I would expect the consensus that the government is free to do any deal it likes with the EU will break down in the next few months as more groups of people question if the government intends delivering a deal with the EU that will match what they want. This division will particularly affect those who voted for Brexit, but don't want what ever type of Brexit the government appears to favour. The realisation that A50 happening before 31st March will mean that there is no progress on EU negotiations for several months while the French and German elections take place with also be questioned. Mrs May's authority will be questioned, as an unelected dictator (she was not elected as Party Leader, she has no mandate for any particular variety of Brexit, she has not faced a General Election.)"

However what politicians say will happen and what actually happens is not necessarily the same. Clearly there is pressure on Mrs May to show that progress is being made on Brexit. In my opinion these announcements are more to do with giving the appearance of progress than actually making progress. They relieve the pressure. There is no urgency to repeal the 1972 Act as Mrs May has said it will not be operative until the UK actually leaves the EU, which if A50 is invoked in early 2017 would not be until early 2019. There are several things that could (conveniently) delay the time table. It is not obvious that it would be easy to get the repeal act through parliament. The Conservatives have a small majority in the Commons and no majority in the Lords. It could be that MPs (or Lords) will want more control over the terms of any Brexit deal and will not want to pass the repeal act without knowing what the Brexit terms will be or having a parliamentary vote on triggering A50 or the final Brexit deal. A delay to the repeal act could be used as a reason for delaying invoking A50. It remains odd deciding to invoke A50 a few weeks before a French Presidential election when the candidates for that election have already started to come up with widely different ideas about the kind of deal they would offer the UK. (It is the members of the EU that tell the UK what the terms of Brexit will be). Another reason for delay of A50 could be that Davis has not got his act together by next March and is not ready. Note; Mrs May can blame Davis and his team. On the other hand the motor industry and the banks will be increasingly actioning contingency plans regarding relocating their businesses but repealing the 1972 act and invoking A50 will not actually make the terms of Brexit any clearer, so presumably they will continue with their plans regardless until the actual terms of Brexit are agreed. So I have modified my forecast, but I take what Mrs May says with a pinch of salt."

The first link makes it clear there is very little chance of a Freetrade deal with EU post-Brexit (and zero chance of staying in the single market). And the boss of Nissan says in order to invest in Nissan UK he would expect compensation if the UK has no freetrade deal with the EU. The second link says there will be free trade with the EU, and in case their is not it does not really matter because the UK can have freetrade with Australia and others. Wanting something to happen is not the same as having evidence that it is going to happen. Freetrade is a good liberal ideal. In the 19th century Britain was powerful enough to force it on much of the world (often with the help of gunboats). In the 21st century you need multilateral trade deals. These trade deals, in order to satisfy voters, require to cover more than trade. They need to cover standards, they need to cover courts of arbitration, they need to cover the environment, they need to cover employment standards. I don't hear Fox talking about any of these aspects. In a previous version of the second article Fox was quoted as saying that the UK would have left the EU before the next election in 2020, which would presumably mean A50 invoked before Jun 2018. My conclusion is that as others have said, Brexit is a shambles and seems to be being run by people who are delusional (as Clegg says in the second article) . These delusions are of course the same ones that were peddled before the vote. The difference is that the Brexit team then said that these agreements would be easy, now they admit agreement will be hard. Would any rational person risk A50 is these circumstances? To make any progress on Brexit Fox, Johnson. and Davis need to be fired and some rational negotiators who don't start with the impediments of being regarded as untrustworthy jokers by the world."

Its seems that the banks estimate that it will take them at least 4 years to build the new office blocks they will need inside the EU so that they can move without losing business, so they are looking for an interim deal that will give them access to the EU until they can move. Car makers have a much bigger problem in that you can't move a car plant as easily as you can move a desk, but they will not want to have to write off the newer car plants. (My guess is that GM will use Brexit as an excuse to abandon UK manufacturing), the others will want a deal that gives them access to the EU, which means that some sort of deal on retaining at least some of the freedom of movement is needed. The benefits of having immigrants is slowly being recognised; do the Brexit people really believe that redundant bankers and car workers will take over emptying bed pans in care homes, and picking vegetables in Boston? As the months go by a choice between a slow decline as businesses relocate or stay but stop investing because of the uncertainty and A50 with no deal with the EU being in prospect which will produce a fast decline at the end of 2 years. Neither option seems good, so it will be clearer that either a deal to stretch Brexit out over a decade or so, or a decision that Brexit will be abandoned will become desirable."

This way in Jan 2017 the PM can announce that Davis and Fox are not yet ready with the plan (from the list of things they need to do I would be surprised if they will have completed their brief). Davis and Fox, both Brexit supporters can be blamed for the delay. Then it can be announced that A50 take place can't place while the French elections take place, which will have got us to late May 2017, then there will be no point in A50 as the summer holidays are coming, then it can be delayed while the German elections take place. Meanwhile some outlines of what the UK is prepared to settle for will have been leaked and whatever the aims are will not please large stakeholders (because the UK Government knows the claimed Brexit outcome of Full access to the single market on the same terms as EU members, the UK not being subject to EU rules, the UK being able to decide on immigration from the EU, and the UK not paying anything to EU budget, are not going to be offered.)

PM May has said, to the public and her European counterparts, that she will trigger Art 50 in early 2017. Looks like for now she is standing by her word. On the other hand, the government doesn't seem to be ready with its negotiating position, with BoJo, Davis/Fox, and Hammond each pulling in different directions. Moreover, the position, whatever it is, will need to be at least discussed with the governments of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland before finalization. Finally, the position should be discussed in parliament, even if a parliament vote is not necessary as May said. All this cannot be done before February 2017 at best. Then the practical considerations - the French elections - kick in. The issue is not so much who will win, but that the EC will procrastinate and not make much a move before that (and, for that matter, before the German elections in September). I am still betting 2-1 that the UK government will go ahead with Art 50 in the first half of 2017, but it's far from a done deal."

It is reported that officials do not expect article 50 invoked before late 2017. There is little evidence that the Brexit team have any understanding of how complicated Brexit will be. So far May is adopting a classic strategy of letting the Bexiteers tangle themselves in knots. The Brexit team are implausibly claiming that the Leave vote has not (yet) caused any harm to the UK (I don't think many of the much derided ""experts"" said it would have wrecked the UK in the first seven weeks, it would take 2 to 5 years after the UK left the EU to hit the bottom). But the warning signs of damage are visible; a lower pound, lower credit rating, lower business activity, lower job vacancies, lower interest rates. In my opinion May is planning to keep saying ""Brexit means Brexit"" while it becomes increasingly obvious that what the Brexit crew promised was a delusion and what Brexit really means is an economic disaster and social catastrophe. Only when the Brexit team eat humble pie and admit they cannot deliver anything that they promised will May ask the public (or Parliament) if they still want to invoke article 50. No one who is actually involved in Brexit seems to want a quick article 50 invocation."

The referendum isn't binding, and the numbers in parliament are fairly strongly against a Brexit. So it is possible that A50 is never invoked, though it is likely many MPs will go with the judgment of the people. The legal issues here are also quite complex and could bog down (or impede altogether) the invocation of A50. For example, some scholars/legal experts think the Parliament must repeal the 1972 European Communities Act in order to invoke Article 50."
