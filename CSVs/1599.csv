There should be more studies done on all contact sports, regardless of what medium is hitting the head (Example soccer ball to the head) any sport can be a potential for CTE. The long term ramifications to CTE on treatment, medications, including Dementia care at earlier age when you can no longer care for yourself should be discussed with every parent and child that is interested in contact sports, and it should come from not only their physicians, but the whole sporting industry in an effort to reduce the potentially life altering long term effects from CTE. Alzheimer's/Dementia is a devastating illness regardless whether its from fatty plagues or repeated head trauma. We are unprepared even now with all the current information we have on Alzheimer's/Dementia, limited medical options/funding, so it comes down to a personal decision to not play a sport that could impact you even before you can vote, marry, see the world."
