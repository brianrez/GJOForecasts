As a result, the PM2.5 dust content as of now (88) is much lower than e.g. in Sarajevo (106) let alone in Algiers (152) or Kuwait City (169). There seems to be a pattern in which the AQI varies widely between roughly 75 and 125 under normal conditions within 24 hours, which suggests a 1-day-average may lie near 100, while traffic apparently worsens air quality during office hours on some particular days. The most important parameter, however, appears to be current weatherand thus of natural origin: wind directions and dust (sand) content of the air due to sand storm. Dubai in particular seems to benefit from it geology and from being located directly on the Persian Gulf's shores. Unless strong sand storms take place before the end of March, it appears that March 2022 has been a mediocre month wrt to air quality so far, and will produce an ""average"" monthly AQI for the whole month. One large source of uncertainty, however, is the fact that now and then values are not logged or temporarily unattainable. If there is a ""systematic error"", which excludes e.g. only very high or only very low values from being logged, the monthly average could be skewed slightly or biased. However, for Dubai's reporting, such ""invalid entries"" appear to be rare and reporting appears to be very stable."
