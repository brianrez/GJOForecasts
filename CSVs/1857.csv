Second the recent debate between both creates more positive feedback from mass media for Macron as Le Pen. Third Le Pen populates the opinion, that foreigners (EU ""dominated"" by Germany and especially Germany by itself) has caused the bad key numbers of France: The jobless rate 9,9% (G=4,1%), jobless rate young 24,6% (G=7 %), National Debts 96,4% of BIP, (G=68,2% of BIP), Budget Balance -3,3% of BIP (G=+0,6% of BIP) {all numbers from ""Handelsblatt live"" 04.05.2017}. Le Pen means from my perspective: France are strongly handicapped by the foreigners, therefore she is against Euro, EU and the bad influence of Germany as a whole. Offer for her supporters: Cut the EU membership, no Euro currency anymore but again Franc as new currency and close of the borders with No Schenken Agreement anymore. Le Pen uses emotionally intercultural patters of incompatibility between France and the Others, which populates historical ideas from the last Century. Similar argued 8 of 11 parties in the first round. Fourth: All modern intercultural well educated French citizen are resistant for that ideas from my knowledge.

Analysis of voting patterns from the 23 April first round shows Ms Le Pen gained most votes in the north-east and south-east of France, where the National Front has traditionally seen its strongest support. 4. Mr Macron gained most support from more westerly areas, and he also fared well in parts of Paris. Now the two candidates stand at 60% for Macron and 40% for Le Pen. 5. Some news are saying that MLP is gaining traction. 6. One of the overriding issues facing French voters is unemployment, which stands at almost 10%. One in four under-25s is unemployed. Ms Le Pen has proved popular with the unemployed as well as younger voters who are frustrated about the lack of jobs and France's poor economic prospects. 7. The French economy has made a slow recovery from the 2008 financial crisis and both candidates are calling for deep changes. 8. Mr Macron was economy minister in President Francois Hollande's government and is promising a series of liberal reforms including cutting public spending and business taxes. 9. Security and immigration are also high on the agenda. 10. France is still in a state of emergency after the terror attack on Nice on 14 July 2016 when a lorry ploughed into a crowd celebrating Bastille Day. 11. More than 230 people have died in terror attacks in France since January 2015 and the murder of a policeman on the Champs Elysées three days before the first round was a deadly reminder of the threat from militant Islamists. 12. Officials fear more of the hundreds of young French Muslims who have travelled to Syria and Iraq may return to commit further atrocities. 13. Ms Le Pen wants to cut immigration and restrict nationality rights, as well as hold a referendum on EU membership. She has accused her rival of being weak on terrorism ______________________________ COMMENTS: There are a lot os pro-and-cons for both candidates:"

Aside from that, from where I sit (an ocean and a continent away), Le Pen seems to come across to voters as a regular gal, and Macron can never escape his identity as a toff - or as cultured and sophisticated, depending on which definition you choose. Either way, Macron seems to me to look out-of-touch with voters below a certain economic, educational, and social threshold. I think it's entirely possible that more people will vote *against* Macron because he's a toff than will vote *for* him because he's urbane and well educated. I consider it a mistake to think that Macron will unquestionably get more Melenchon voters than Le Pen. Most Melenchon supporters may stay home, but I think the majority of those who go to the polls will probably vote for Le Pen.

I'm not sure Fillon's endorsement of Macron will matter very much, and Melenchon has declined to endorse either candidate (so far).

Last year she has polled between 26% and 30%, now she is polling around 22% or 23%. I see no signs of a Brexit effect or a Trump effect boosting the FN. It is reported that 30% of voters have not yet decided who to vote for. It would seem more likely to me that this 30% are not FN supporters, but LR or PS supporters. The PS supporters being disappointed with the current PS Government and the LR supporters being disappointed by the sleeze of the LR candidate. A year ago the LR was polling between 35% and 40%, so its possible that on voting day more LR supporters will reluctantly vote for Fillon, or they may not vote at all or they might vote for Macron (who is not as left wing as some forecasters seem to think. and in French terms very much on the centre ground)."

This will leave Le Pen stronger as she can draw more republican and right wing votes than Mélenchon. In the case where Le Pen faces Macron, the rise of Mélenchon means that more potential voters of Macron will abstain under Mélenchon's influence. Also, Republicans seem to be back in the game.

The headlines talk of a surge by Le Pen, by Macron, by Melenchon or Fillon, or less often a fall in support for Le Pen, Macron, Melenchon or Fillon. Reading the details it then transpires that the ""surge"" or ""fall"" is somewhere between 0.5% and 1% in one poll. The only real change over the last month is that the hard left is moving from supporting Hamon to Melenchon who has also picked up a few supporters from Le Pen and Macron. My guess is that Hamon will not drop much further (there must be some loyal PS supporters) So to get much higher Melenchon would have to pick up votes from Macron, Fillon or Le Pen. It seems unlikely that Fillon's supporters would switch to Melenchon (conservative Catholics supporting the hard-left seems unlikely). It seems slightly more credible that Macron supporters who support him because he is an outsider and are not really into policy details could switch to Melenchon as another outsider. It seems more possible that some Le Pen supporters could switch to Melenchon, the far left and far right seem to often meet at the anti-libera/unrealisticl extreme. Maybe the actual votes will depend on who actually turns out to vote. Will those who dream of a 30 hour week with early retirement, and those who dream of France as it was 70 years ago without immigrants, rush to vote because they think they can make their dreams come true, or do they know that voting for the dream will be like voting for Hollande, who had a dream that he could not deliver."

Melenchon is attracting more and more of the votes from the Socialist Hamon who in the last three weeks has lost a third of his support. It appears that Melenchon may be also picking up votes from Le Pen and Macron who have both also slipped back a bit in the last week. If Melenchon continues to pick up votes he could challenge Le Pen and Macron in the battle for the two run off places. French voters must be thinking about tactical voting by now. Melenchon's policies must sound very appealing to socialists (reduce the hours and the years that people will work to spread the work between the people, tax the fat cats income at 100%). How many socialists really believe him is a different matter. They must have noticed that the present socialist government did not actually trust these policies and that France still has higher unemployment than less socialist countries in Europe. So maybe those who will actually caste a ballot for him will only be the true believers in socialism, just as the only people who will vote for Le Pen will be the true believers in Nationalism. The problem for many French people would come if the two candidates that get into the 2 round are Melenchon and Le Pen, both extremists who seem to offer different solutions that are equally outside the mainstream. If this looks likely the mainstream voters could abandon Fillon and switch to Macron as he looks less scary than Le Pen or Melenchon."

The En Marche candidate has a lot of momentum, but is unproven and does not have as solid of a base as Marine le Pen. In a two candidate runoff, I could see En Marche winning a majority.

Polls that exclude Bayrou as a candidate appear to show that of the Bayrou supporting 5.5% of voters about 2% would switch to Macron and about 1% would switch to Fillion. As an alliance it seems likely that more would follow Bayrou and switch to Macro, which would presumably put Macron 1% or 2% ahead of Fillion. Melenchon has said that he has no intention of forming a left wing alliance with Hamon. It would appear that Melenchon has no chance of getting into the 2nd round and if his supporters stick with his hopeless cause (as they did in 2012) Hamon will also have no chance of getting into the 2nd round. The choice for Hamon's supporters will then be to waste their 1st round vote and risk the 2nd round being a choice between the Right and the Far Right or to switch to Macron so that the 2nd round is between someone that at least has sympathies with the Socialists and the FN. So in effect the Socialist voters in the 1st round will be voting for either a Republican president if they waste their votes on Hamon or a Socialist/Centrist if they switch their votes to Macron. Which presumable they would prefer as the least bad outcome. Although it is possible that traditional left wing voters might switch to the FN (in a similar way to traditional Democrat voters switching to Trump or traditional Labour voters in the UK switching to UKIP) it seem less likely now in France, because the FN has been in existence a long time and polls show that only about 5% of voters would switch from any other parties to FN in a 2nd round run off. So my guess remains that as the election approaches a few Melenchon supporters will switch to Hamon, but that rather more Hamon supporters will switch to Macron. Of course events could change that."

Therefore it's reasonsble to assume that unless the French counter terrorism forces have suddenly become spectacularly effective (unlikely, though improvements have been made), an attack is due. In light of the fact that the strategy underpinning the attacks is to turn French society against it's Muslim citizens, it can be supposed that a signinificant attack is due in advance of the elections, with the aim of promoting support for Le Pen. Therefore, assuming a major attack takes place before the French elections, the chances of a Le Pen victory rise noticeably."

The fractured Left makes it much easier for LePen to make it to the second round because the traditional base of the left is split amongst 3 parties. Three weeks ago I would have put Les Republicains as the front runner but Penelopegate has caused me to seriously reevaluate that estimate and Fillon has dropped precipitously in the polls. So the fractured left is an artifact that increases Lepen's chances of making it to the second round 3. Macron (or Fillon) are more centrist candidates (v Melenchon/Hamon/Lepen) and could be stomached by voters of the opposite party in the interest of defeating LePen 4. However, Marine is much more moderate than Jean Marie and has run a campaign that has attracted much broader swathes of support than he ever did 5. Macron and Fillon both represent the ""global elite"" a much derided class of people whose positions on globalization and liberalism have been defeated at the polls in Brexit and the Trumpocalypse despite both of those events being seen as relative long shots at various points 6. a terrorist attack in Europe between now and the election could drive more people into LePen's camp 7.

Fillon's support continues to drop as the Fake Jobs for his wife and children scandal shows no sign of going away. Its difficult to see what the Republicans can do about it. The scandal must reflect badly on the morals of a candidate who is supposed to be the moral candidate. Getting another candidate sounds like the best idea in theory, but then that person would have the problem of being the Republican's second choice, and would probably have to chosen by the party rather than via a primary which would also harm a new candidates credibility. The Socialist candidate's support according to the very latest poll seems to be slipping, but that might just reflect a different polling method by the polling organisation. Melonchon's support has dropped over the last couple of weeks. I would expect as the date of the first round voting approaches support for candidates who have less than 10% support in the polls to (e.g. Melonchon and Bayrou) to continue to fade as voters think more about keeping out those who they are most worried about as President (rather than just who they like) So far Macron seems to have the advantage of seeming to be the candidate that is the least bad choice of the most voters. He is not a ""regular business as usual politician"", he is not of the populist toxic right, he is not extreme left. He can't be blamed for the past mistakes of the Socialists (he was a minister, but more of a technocrat than a policy setter), or the Republicans. I suspect that few French voters have examined his policies in detail, and so he can appeal to those who just see the fresh face. I suspect that few NF supporters really believe Le Pen could deliver on her policies (or would actually want her to). I suspect few Socialist or Melonchon supports really believe that shorter working hours are the answer to France's problems. So if the Republicans can't put up a good clean candidate Macron must stand a good chance of winning as the ""change"" candidate. Many voters probably just want a change, have little idea about what changes would be good, but a better idea of what changes they don't like the sound of."

Fillon is a candidate that could stop many voters to whom Le Pen could appeal from voting for Le Pen, given his conservative, outlook and as PS are currently v unpopural, this could have been an easy election for him. However, the wife payment affair and the fact that Macron is independent (albeit with PS provenance) complicate things. If Fillon pulls out, Le Pen's position could strengthen and it's not clear what e.g. Juppe's chances would be. If Macron goes through, he should have been expected to capture all the left votes and enough from centre/right to give him the win. But as we've seen elsewhere, the left/right analysis is very inadequate - he is probably considered 'elite' and therefore could lose a lot of leftwing voters to Le Pen."

Those who support Populists (e.g. Trump, UKIP, Le Pen) seem to be very tolerant of scandals that would be career ending for liberal candidates. It is reported that some Wikileaks documents on Macron are linked to the US Clinton hacking. If so and if all the Wikileaks documents just released are all from the same source it (again) raises the question of who hacked them and why are they being released now? Presumably the Russians would prefer Le Pen as the next President of France so why would they hurt her chances? (Maybe, like me, they think that her voters will not mind her misusing a bit of EU money and releasing documents that appear to be harming her will just confuse the western media.) I guess the impact on the French election will depend on what dirt they have on Macron and Fillon (I have not heard of any Wikileaks on the left wing candidates.)"

These are paid directly by Parliament, within the limit of A total budget of around EUR 24 000 per Member. However, In 2015, Parliament's governing bodies expressed doubts about 29 of these parliamentary assistants. Apparently they occupied strategic posts within the FN or directly from Marine Le Pen, should NOT receive allowances since they work for the FN rather than on the European files. Some ""accredited"" assistants, contractually obliged to live in Brussels, would very rarely set foot in the Belgian capital. 2. The National Front is suspected of having set up a system of fraudulent financing for all its electoral campaigns since the arrival of Marine Le Pen to its presidency: cantonal 2011, presidential and legislative 2012, municipal, European and senatorial 2014, departmental and Regional meetings 2015. 3. In their asset declarations of MEPs, given in 2014, Marine Le Pen and her father Jean-Marie would have lowered the value of several real estate. In particular, they would have underestimated by two thirds the value of their shares in the SCI holding the famous family manor of Montretout, in Saint-Cloud (Hauts-de-Seine).

A left leaning candidate (Hamon) seems to have won this round and the right leaning candidate seems to have got about 30% of the votes, meaning that around 70% of the primary voters chose the more extremist left wingers. Its reasonable to assume that Hamon will pick up these extreme left votes in the second round. Which will mean Hamon is the official Socialist Candidate. The turnout for the primary was low which reflects that the French left has lost its enthusiasm and presumably does not believe its likely that a Socialist will win the Presidency election. However in the polls left wing candidates (socialists in outlook) are supported by about as many voters (about 25%) as the far right FN (26%), the right Republicans (27%) and the centre (21%). The difference is that support on the left is divided between the Socialist Party itself and several individuals and small parties. According to the current polls the FG party of Melenchon (15%) is more popular than the official Socialist Party (about 10%) neither are thought to have any realistic chance of winning, or of even getting into the second round. In the 2012 election Melenchon's support drifted down from 17% to 11% by election day (presumably because his supporters gave him no chance of winning and wanted to vote for the least bad candidate who had a chance of winning.) But in 2012 they had the choice of switching to an official Socialist who had a good chance of winning (and who did win), but in 2017 there is no Socialist who appears to have any chance of winning. So what will left wing voters do? Option A would be for all left wing supporters to support one candidate. It seems too late for that option. Option B would be for left wing supporters to stick to voting for candidates who have no hope of winning, which is likely to guarantee that the next President is either from the Right or the Far Right. Presumably most left wingers would not want that, although some ""left behind"" voters wanting a revolution might be tempted to switch to Le Pen. In the past second round voting after the left wing candidates had been eliminated has not shown evidence of left wing voters switching to FN. Option C would be for the tactical voting to start in the first round (as appeared to happen in 2012, when Melenchon's support faded). In this case its would seem possible that supporters for left wing candidates start looking for the least bad (as they see it) of the three main candidates. There are more than 25% of voters who favour the left. It seems entirely possible that a quarter or more of them could switch to Macron as being less right wing than Fillon or Le Pen. Although a few revolutionary minded left wing voters could switch to Le Pen I doubt that many left wing supporters would switch to Fillon. So I see the first round going to any two of Le Pen, Fillon or Macron, with the second round going to Fillon or Macron. If the first round goes to Le Pen and Fillon then the second round is likely to go to Fillon. If the first round goes to Le Pen and Macron then the second round would likely go to Macron. If the first round goes to Fillon and Macron then the second round would likely go to Macron. So on that basis its 2 out of 3 chances to Macron. But there is still a greater chance of Fillon getting to the second round that Macron."

However, were Hamon to win the nomination, presidential election polls predict that some Socialist supporters will vote for Macron, bringing him within a striking distance to Fillon. Moreover, the support for the Socialist candidate will drop to single digits, raising the chances that the Party may actually decide to support Macron. Finally, were Macron to strike a deal with Bayrou to support him, Macron's support would rise further. So Macron appears to have a (long-shot) path to the Presidency - besting Fillon in the first round and beating Le Pen in the second. For this, he has to construct a centrist coalition, ranging from moderate Socialists to moderate right-of-center voters (Juppe's crowd) and including Bayrou's people. Not that likely, but possible.

HFM quoted says: "" “It is a weird and misconceived theory. The French electorate will not take inspiration [from the UK and the US] because they feel there is some type of populist uprising.” Also quoted is a manager who says: “If we hedge, it will be much closer to the time. It will not be the cornerstone of any investment strategy until then. Cyclical drivers and the central banks will be much more important. We need to get through the first hundred days of Trump first,” he says. But this misses all the other reasons people might vote for her: *Migrants in Calais are suffering (this is a reason to limit immigration for someone who sees refugees living in tents in freezing temperatures. In other words, pity generates the same desire to limit the suffering as fear and anti-immigration feelings do. *nice attack * MLpen has astutely postioned herself left of far-right in an effort to distance herself from her father’s legacy of hatred – not sure if it works but… *Fillion has made the tactical mistake of positioning himself left of his more moderate right-wing platform. This puts him closer to the Socalist party which I don’t think anyone thinks will win * Fund Managers have tunnel vision bias – Trumpian uncertainties take precedence because he is news right now; iow trump presidency is a certain change occurring now with an uncertain future impact that managers hope they can mitigate by relation on baromenter of actions of the Federal Reserve, known, and comforting method of hedging. (Question: how do you as a fund manager mitigate outcome of people voting for an unsavoury agitating character? Answer: You can’t: all you can do is hope it doesn’t happen.) Fool’s paradise."

This is very unpredictable but Based upon Trump success, the FSB operation against Fillon and for LePen now, and in Germany and France will continue, I see one certainty left for NATO and Germany and the West: barring another terror attack, Merkel wins 3d term via grand coalition, TINA There is no alternative but she is fragile due to humanitarian admission of almost 1-million refugees. Merkel is the longest surviving post war Germany Chancellor with Adenauer and Kohl and leaders last long in the wonderful democracy fostered by Marshall plan and development of EU. Give Merkel credit. She is the most senior and successful G-7 leader. She will make the accomodations as US did for surveillance and homeland security and balance strong German constitution. My sense is that Fillon is the weakest target 1,)owns a Chateaux 2.) is appealing to outright conservative catholics in a Country where less than 10% go to mass and it is as secular as any country and church-state separation is in the French DNA .see First Republic, church dis established and all church properties in the First real democratic "" revolution"" and leaders from Clemenceau who fought church over Dreyfuss to DeGaulle-conservative and secular, Fillon is chasing identity politics and demographic segments ala Hillary Clinton. 3.)

The danger to him is that if he slips much further in the Polls he will create space for Macon. With no official Socialist candidate being selected until the end of January the socialist supporters have split their vote between the 4 leading candidates. If the support for these 4 socialists is added together the socialist party would be leading the polls. The polls appear to show that Socialism is the most popular ideology but the polls ratings of the current socialist government show that liking an ideology and being able to implement it are two different things. The critical issue will be who the Socialists pick as their candidate and how much support will be transferred from the losing Socialist candidates to him/her. Picking someone who is popular with the parties left wing base (e.g. Montebourg, Hamon) would probably not attract many non-Socialists in the Presidental election. If Valls is chosen left wing Socialist might not bother to support him in the Presidential election. Some traditional left wing voters might switch to the NF (as has happened in local elections) but there seems little sign of it in the polls so far. So for this reason I don't forecast a win for the Socialists in this question. Macon is now looking to have an outside chance. His problem will be getting into the 2nd round. If the Socialists select a left wing candidate and/or if Fillon appears to be trying to grab votes from Le Pen by being too right-wing, then Macon stands a chance, but he would need to get more votes than either Le Pen or Fillon in the first round. I think the election is still Fillon's to lose, but he could screw up. In this election it seems that the real questions that voters are going to be considering is ""who do you not want as President and how do I stop him/her"". If Le Pen gets into the 2nd round I think that (as has happened before with the NF) the answer will be ""not Le Pen""."

He also appears to have a strong sense of integrity, something that is commendable but not really a successful trait for a professional politician who needs to change opinion and alliances to survive in the long run. Fillon also seems to be pro-Russia and critical of the EU which makes this prediction even more complicated.

We now know that Hollande is not going to be the Socialist candidate, which raises their chances a little. The polls have consistently shown the Republicans to be the most popular party ahead of the Front National by 4 to 6 percent in the first round and the Republicans opening up this lead to up to 30% in the latest 2 nd round polls. The FN seems to attract no additional votes between the first and second rounds and no poll shows over 45% for the FN and most polls have the FN at around 33% to 40%. The campaigns have not yet started so It could change. There is no sign in the polls of the surprising Brexit vote or the election of Trump affecting the mood in France. This is surprising as the English language media have made a lot of the idea that there is a swing to the populist right throughout Europe. One might have expected that disillusioned Socialists would switch to the FN, in the same way that Trump has picked up votes from left behind Democrats, and that the media claims are UK Labour voters switching to UKIP. The French polls show no such move. In fact Le Pen's best polling figures seem to have been in 2014 and 2015, and are lower now. Maybe the UK Brexit supporters are just indulging in wishful thinking believing that most countries in the EU are going to vote for right wing populist parties. Austria's re-run Presidential election showed a clear swing away from the Populist candidate between the May vote and December vote, opening up a 7% lead for the non-Populist winner. Maybe the European Populist tide has passed its high water mark; voters have made their protest and seen no obvious improvements. I doubt that many EU voters see the Brexit vote in the UK has brought any benefits. The latest polls show that only 39% of employees in the UK expect the UK Government to be able to negotiate a good Brexit deal - not a great endorsement of the idea of leaving the EU. As the FN wants to hold a referendum of France leaving the EU the lack of progress in the UK on Brexit would not be an encouragement (and Frexit would be far more difficult that Brexit, as France would presumably need to figure out how to leave the Euro as well)."

His messaging has been clear and direct and above all SIMPLE which is what people need to see to have confidence that their president can handle a complex world - that person needs to be able to synthesize clearly, simply and in a short statement why they are the best solution and Macron has done that.

This means that National Front will do well enough in the first round to make it to the second round, and then FN will be defeated by a high margin.

Traditionally when the FN makes it to the second round, the two mainstream parties unite around the alternative so the Republicans get higher odds than the FN. However, because Fillon (the Republican candidate) is more right-wing than a normal candidate, and the Socialists are almost comically unpopular right now, I see a realistic chance that the mainstream parties do not unit this time and the FN slips in with a narrow win."

As long as Fillon campaigns on a hard austerity Thatcher-like policies ( which I happen to agree with) he will drive blue collar socialist vote to Le Pen. LePen will be in second round and her chances have been discounted too much due to bias. Valles has some chance. Not inpossible.

The two-round system of voting may make it more difficult for Le Pen, however, if a unifying anti-FN campaign emerges between the first and second rounds. Given past precedent (both in 2002 Presidential election, and more commonly in local and regional elections on numerous occasions over the past 30 years or so), this is a reasonable presumption. The question remains whether Marine Le Pen - who in many ways has successfully distanced herself from undesirable aspects of her party's past, can overcome such a hurdle. Further large-scale Islamic terrorist attacks in France would almost certainly help her case, as does the fact that neither of the frontrunning Republican candidates particularly attractive: Juppe is patrician and of the old - Chiracquian - order, as well as being one of the very few senior French politicians ever to have been convicted of corruption and temporarily barred from holding public office. Sarkozy was not a successful president, who almost completely failed to live up to the (bright and radical) promises of his campaign, and by now in many ways is a washed-out imitation of Marine Le Pen (all the way down to his affinity with Putin). Why would anyone vote for him when they can have the real thing?"

I therefore see the result of the primary votes being either a socialist party v republican battle or a republican v national front battle, and as the republicans are the centre of both of these parties, they will be in position to form an electoral pact and win."

The race for the Republicans’ nomination, at a two-round vote in November, is turning into a contest between Alain Juppé, a patrician ex-prime minister, and Nicolas Sarkozy, a hyperactive ex-president. Opinion polls suggested Mr Sarkozy was closing in on Mr Juppé, but now the front-runner has widened his lead. The result will depend on turnout: any supporter can register on the day and vote. The more who do, the better Mr Juppé’s chances. Mr Sarkozy’s anti-immigration platform appeals to hard-core party supporters. But Mr Juppé is a more unifying moderate. With Marine Le Pen of the extreme-right National Front likely to be in next spring’s run-off, Mr Juppé has even won support among voters on the left—many of whom assume the Socialist incumbent, François Hollande, has no chance at all"

All polls shows that the National Front will be running against a Republican nominee and that the Republican nominee will win. The socialist have barely 0% chance to win the election. If Francois Hollande runs, he won't even qualify for the second round according to many polls. However, Francois hollande is not even sure to win the socialist primary first as Arnaud Montebourg could win (50/50 according to polls). In the event Montebourg was to win the socialist primary, and that the republican nominee would be Nicolas Sarkozy, the center left candidate Emmanuel Macron (former socialist which will run under his own party ""En Marche"") could eventually create a surprise and make it to the second round against the national front (If the center right candidate François Bayrou do not run or make a deal with him). In that case, the chances to win for Emmanuel Macron would be of 80% against the national front. An even biggest surprise would be the election of Marine Le Pen (National front) if she was to run against a non republican. Given the above, the only important prediction to be made here is about the republican nominee that has 95% chances to win afterwards. The latest polls suggest that Alain Juppe will win (56/44 %). However, the former president Nicolas Sarkozy has generated a dynamic around him and his catching up against his competitor and former minister Alain Juppe. My prediction is that given the latest events in France (Paris and Nice Attacks, Syrian refugees, high unemployment rate), Nicolas Sarkozy which runs a campaign further to the right than Alain Juppe, should win the republican nomination (51/49) and win the presidential election against Marin Le Pen (65/35)."

However, media has speculated that the Socialist Party will nominate a different candidate, due to Hollande's low approval ratings. Hollande has suggested that he may not stand for re-election if he fails to reduce the French unemployment rate by the end of his term. He stated this point again in February 2015, saying that ""if after five years, a President cannot meet the objective that he had when he got elected, he cannot be once more a candidate for the highest office in the country"". In June 2016 it was announced that the Socialist Party would choose their candidate in an open primary, as happened in 201. I see Valls as a good opponent to Hollande, and of course Macron. 4.

To lose the Republicans would need to choose a very poor candidate or really screw up the campaign. As in many elections now (for the US President for example) voters vote against the candidate they hate as much as for the candidate they want. The NF seems to have strong support in 27% to 39% range, for the first round but in a second round the only candidate that would risk losing to Le Pen would be Hollande. Hollande seems so unpopular that unless the Republicans pick a really poor candidate he would not get into the second round. It appears that the NF are extremely likely to get the second round. So the logical thing for each of the other parties to do would be to choose the candidate that can most certainly beat her. The socialists will find it difficult to find such a candidate, the Republicans have several who appear to be likely to beat Le Pen; Juppe seems to be more popular (or less unpopular) than Sarkozy. There is a chance that Macron could win, but the opinion polls that suggested he would do well assumed that he would be a candidate for the Socialists, he has now said he hopes to stand for a centerist party. Political parties in France seem to be much more like the personal team of a politician and rise and fall with their leaders, than the more institutional permanent political parties in most other countries. (The politicians are bigger than the parties in France.) So its not clear if breaking with the unpopular PS of Hollande would befit or harm Macron. Maybe he is too new to have as many voters hate him as hate the other candidates."
