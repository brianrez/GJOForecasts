He could be prepared to feed the President to the Democrats in Congress, should he be fired (the rumor mill reports that this is close Mulvaney's own take on the matter). Alternately, he could be being set up as the fall guy for the Ukraine scandal.

Trump loves this sort of blind loyalty and may want to keep Mulvaney happy if he knows anything really bad about Trump--I am sure he does. On the other hand, Trump has no loyalty to others, unless there is something in it for him, and he still does not seem to like or have much faith in Mulvaney's ability."

63835,2019-11-12T23:16:02Z,4,[78.0],[-6.0],"I'm going to be an odd-man-out and continue to keep the chance of dismissal/resignation high. Mick initially tried to split the baby by initiating a judicial review that would determine that he didn't have to appear before committee - contradicting the President's order to simply not appear. Then he tried to join Charles Kupperman's existing suit testing immunity to subpoena, and was rebuffed by that Plaintiff and the judge at a hearing last night. He then indicated to the judge he'd pursue a separate suit. Today his lawyers announce he'll do what he's told to do by the WH, and cease pursuing any suit on the matter, and simply not appear before committee. Cipollone has always wanted Mulvaney off the team, opining that Mulvaney has been at best ineffective, and at worst decidedly counterproductive to the President's interest, and now to his defense. An example of the former was MM's October news conference - Mick has since developed an allergy to podiums. An example of the latter is this attempt at judicial review - had Mulvaney pursued and lost, this would have established the matter into law. Further WH resistance to subpoena would be patently illegal - thus adding a possible Article for obstruction should the WH continue to resist subpoenas. Without a judicial determination - the matter remains in the domain of speculation, and is consistent with the WH effort to run out the clock on the country's interest. Near term - things are such that rather than scapegoating him out the door - Trump will keep him close - in the WH. And yet - I feel there's something behind this now-aborted legal maneuvering that infers that Mick is aware of dire consequences for himself. If true - he may have to decide his best bet to save himself is to resign, and to ""come in"" and sing."
