At the moment, each of the big name forecasters (Cook, Inside Elections, and Sabato) all have this rated as a tossup. The prediction markets favor Michels (R) and the polls (as modeled by 538) favor Evers. In the end, this all averages out to about 55-45, Michels, but with a large enough deviation to swing it either way. Nothing in the news at the moment is convincing me to put my thumb on the scale, so 55-45 Michels it is."
