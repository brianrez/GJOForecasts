Almost all share a ""lower than the median standing"" , hence relative success in relation to the ""crowd"" (where I'm inching back towards, after getting lazy with updates and the world cascading over me). Intriguingly that doesn't mean they all agree with each other and in fact many differ widely in the bets I see them making. One, in particular, is @Wildwood2000 . He has an intriguing style of consistently making heavy heavy BOLD bets (lots (mostly) of 0's and 100's), and he's consistently kept up one of the lower Brier scores over the last few years."

Recent announcements have not downgraded Italy but have provided a negative outlook That said, according to https://countryeconomy.com/ratings/italy Italy has not had a long term credit rating revision by Moodys or S&P for 2 years. Which is a particularly long time (See history on website above) Moody conducted a review into Italy last year and the report was made in February, where the was no change. However their weekly credit outlook from Moody has reads: Business conditions deteriorating in US, Europe, Australia; activity resuming in China"

3897,2020-03-30T16:28:01Z,1,[34.0],[34.0],"Contra the crowd I am skeptical a downgrade will come this quickly. For Moody's a rating downgrade would put Italy in junk territory & I think it will take a while longer for them to do this, even if it really does seems super likely within the next few years. Fitch aren't due to review within this timeframe. S & P are the most likely to downgrade within our time frame, especially if load of Italian banks need bailouts and the resultant lack of credit causes a severe downgrade of Italy's already dubious growth prospects. But again I think it might take a bit longer to see the full effects of this, and my general impression of ratings agencies is that they tend to be reactive rather than ahead of the game."

The current ratings from the 3 credit rating agencies for Italy are as follows: S&P: BBB (negative outlook) Moody's: Baa3 (stable outlook) Fitch: BBB (negative outlook) So S&P and Fitch both rate Italy two notches above sub-investment grade (or junk) with a negative outlook, while Moody's have them a notch lower.
