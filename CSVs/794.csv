Relations are low at he moment given tit-for-tat detaining of journalists based in each other’s countries and China’s face-saving reaction to Australia’s request for a study into the origin of Covid-19. A Dirk van der Kley form the China Matters* think tank based in Canberra has advocated the hiring of a ‘Foreign Interference Commissioner” to be based at the Australian Human Rights Commission. Given the title of the think tank, there is only one foreign country they are thinking about, but the Human rights angle seems odd. Such a position/department would possibly monitor the situation without handing out accuations. Cyber attacks can be used anonymously or to send a message without the collateral damage, but not necessary to raise the diplomatic temperature. My proposal is that accusations will have little value at this time and have reduced the likelihood accordingly."

Additionally, Australian journalists are being held in China for reasons not released to the public. The TikTok app has also been topical and related to China. This tension could contribute to the Australian government mentioning China as the source however, there may be more of a restriction to specifically name the Chinese government. Lifting the likelihood of any reports directly naming the China government was the recent change to Australia’s extradition treaty with Hong Kong in response to fears over a new national security law imposed by China. The Chinese Government urged the Australian government to immediately stop involving themselves in these issues, with a threatening style quote deriving from the Chinese Embassy: “…otherwise it will lead to nothing but lifting a rock only to hit its own feet"". Because of the length of time since PM Morrison reported this to media (June 2020) and the growing tensions between China and Australia, there is an increased chance someone in the Australian Government will identify the Chinese Government as responsible for the attack. In contrast, the clandestine nature in which ASD operate, and the number of escalating factors involved, there may be an increased level of caution in identifying the Chinese Government for fears of an ongoing feud and retribution (so the probability must be below 50%), however if there is significant evidence, Australia is unlikely to hold back. It is likely Australia will only use estimative language in any accusations against the Chinese Government. In this sense of the question, they will not directly accuse China (and provide 0% chance) but there have been examples in the past where Australia has stated: “China is likely behind the sustained cyber attack” and “One expert says there has been increased espionage activity looking to extract material related to COVID-19”. This increases the probability of this scenario occurring."

Whether or not the Australian Government name China as the source of the cyber-attack depends on the level of tension between Australia and China and the pressure by the international community concerning Covid-19, Hong Kong, Spratly Islands, Indian border etc. It is conceivable that given the vocal potential of Australian Senators that China could be named in Parliament that force the Government into clarifying their position. The Australian Government has joined others in naming Russia in hacking Covid-19 researchers in the west. Therefore, with backing from its allies, Australia could name China directly. I propose a 40% chance of the Australian Government naming China directly by 26 December 2020."
