Under Zelensky, Razumkov said, Ukraine would continue aspiring to join the European Union and NATO, but it would hold a referendum on the issues only when the chance of doing so was realistic. There are currently 4 countries looking to join NATO; Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, the Republic of North Macedonia, and Ukraine. While Ukraine is in the midst of an election, both the incumbent Poroshenko and his leading opponent Zalensky have expressed a desire to join NATO, although no specific timeline has been given, and Zalensky, who recently won a run-off election, has stated that he would wait until the time is right. So while an actual timeline is up in the air, it seems likely that whomever wins the presidential election will seek to hold ascension talks with NATO as well as MAP, due to Poroshenko meeting with NATO this past December, in which NATO reaffirmed support for Ukraine against Russian aggression. NATO announced at a meeting in December 2018 that it is prepared to accept the submission of an ANP by Bosnia and Herzegovina. While some members of the presidency welcomed this new development and expressed hope that state institutions would begin developing an ANP, the leader of the Serb nationaalists in the presidency has repeatedly been against NATO membership. It’s clear that any closer movement by Bosnia and Herzegovina will be contingent on dealing with conflict amongst its different ethnic groups. Due to the ongoing situation in Ukraine, I find it doubtful that Georgia will make any serious moves to join NATO before April 1st. Allowing Georgia to go further along in the membership process would place pressure on Russia that could impede negotiations over the Ukrainian conflict and impede NATO operations in other areas, so both Georgia and NATO are better served maintaining their current cooperative relationship. The Republic of North Macedonia formally signed a letter for ascension in February, and will likely be a full member by the end of the year. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/03/zelensky-face-poroshenko-ukraine-run-exit-poll-190331171422240.html https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49212.htm https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/2671315-poroshenko-we-will-either-reaffirm-course-for-eu-nato-or-return-to-2013.html https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49127.htm https://www.rferl.org/a/nato-gives-bosnia-green-light-to-move-toward-membership/29639709.html https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/world/europe/north-macedonia-nato-russia.html"

First, the process almost always takes more than 5 years, due to the need for ratification by every existing member and the need for the country wishing to access to NATO to conform its armed forces to a certain degree of interoperability before being allowed to move forward. Secondly, As we can see from the most recent two NATO members, Albania and Croatia, even when all requirements are met formal accession does not usually occur by independent nations, as NATO seems to have a tendency to ""group"" countries together and have multiple formally become members at the same time. Given this, I would rate the likelihood of the only reasonable candidate for NATO accession, N. Macedonia, as unlikely before the date required, as such an event would constitute a shift in procedure for NATO which generally is a very procedural institution."

Many individuals who have posted on this question give strong indications that Macedonia will formally become a part of NATO, and I agree, I just don't have full confidence that it will happen within the month. The main obstacle for Macedonia's accession was due to a dispute with Greece based on the country's name. After a formal name change to Northern Macedonia has been approved by Greece, Northern Macedonia is acting as a NATO invitee. Reuters projects that Macedonia will join NATO mid-2020, there is also concern of Russia's “malign influence” in Macedonia which could undermine government efforts to join the EU and NATO. https://www.voanews.com/a/greece-to-ratify-macedonia-s-nato-membership-this-week/4773298.html https://www.wsj.com/articles/greece-approves-macedonias-nato-membership-bid-11549657953 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-macedonia-nato-usa/u-s-sees-macedonia-in-nato-in-mid-2020-after-name-change-deal-idUSKBN1O31ZU"

There is zero chance that either country will advance in the progression in the time frame in this question. Politics also plays in the Bosnia case. The question of how to deal with the Serbian armament in Bosnia (the so-called immovable defense properties) is intractable, especially within the short time frame, and therefore, zero chance. Name-change is the last hurdle for Macedonia to join NATO. With the name-change referendum (passed with over 90% of the votes, but invalid due to low turnout) out of the way, the parliament is working on the name-change by legislation.

However, the recent failure of the referendum on Macedonia's name change (https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/failed-macedonian-referendum-181001185416308.html) further confirms the already apparent difficulties in getting though even this first condition required to begin the formal accession process as laid out in July when the NATO Secretary General announced NATO's invitation to the government in Skopje to begin talks (https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_157315.htm).

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called on Macedonians at the end of September to vote in a referendum to embrace a deal on its name with neighboring Greece and join the defense alliance. However, Macedonians have rejected an attempt to change the name of their nation to North Macedonia, which could mean their country will remain outside the regional power blocs of NATO and the European Union."

However, the internal politics of the aforementioned states are not likely to let the governments make a commitment to NATO their priorities in the nearest future. When it comes to Georgia, the new government is currently preoccupied with eradicating corruption and their domestic situation as a whole. Making international commitments as big as joining NATO are not likely to be in the cards for Georgia for at least another year. However, once the internal overhaul is over, Georgia is likely to be the next country of the Eastern block to join NATO. Given Macedonia's recent referendum vote on the name change of the state and a very low turn out, it is obvious that Macedonia is likely to be preoccupied with internal challenges for the nearest future. In particular, the challenge is to accommodate for the needs and repair relations between the majority population and Serb minorities.

They currently have a slim majority expected to agree to the name change deal agreed upon withe the gov of Greece, but they need 50% of people to actually go out and vote to make. Probability is probably 85% there, I would guess, especially since ethnic Albanians make up 25% of the Macedonian population and largely support the measure. For the 30-40% of the rest of Macedonia to turn out for the vote, even if mostly from the younger or middle generations, seems, seems likely. However, the president has remained firm in opposition and is boycotting the vote out of country (maybe wise), and Russia is still pumping money into campaigning locally against it, as are many Western countries. If it passes but does't have the voter turnout necessary to ratify, then I think they'll reschedule again shortly after the New Year. But it sounds like enough people are grudgingly or significantly motivated by economic and security benefits that they'll go with it for now. Might be a sticky point later. Still, if it passes, it has to be ratified by the Macedonian parliament (likely if it passes) and then be voted on in Greece as well, and ultimate, I think, Greece would have to agree with the Nato accession step. At least they've been the roadblock for the last 3 decades. But I imagine NATO is leaning hard on them, and Greece doesn't really have a lot of public or political power to stand alone against their European allies in this and probably have agreed enough to (grudgingly) move forward if Macedonia ends up agreeing."

(https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/finland_and_sweden_sign_defence_pact_in_turku/10295347) The previous few months (let's say 6) there's been a wide discussion on the NATO topic here in Finland. The president of Finland, Sauli Niinistö, still requires plebiscite on this matter. Even though in my point of view the security matters are probably not the best ones in security topics. My grandparents don't know what the heck NATO is. Why does it matter to this topic? There has been discussion if Sweden joins NATO that's the time when Finland needs to join as well or the door will be closed for good. So with a small chance on this time frame I'd say that if the other side will join NATO, so will the other."

If Macedonia were to receive an invitation by NATO at the summit this week that would be an added incentive. When it comes to the timeline after that, supposedly, it would take time for talks to begin. At the talks, Macedonia would have to ""establish that the preconditions for membership have been met"" so there is probably some prep work that might take time. The next question therefore is about the historical base rates for how long it takes for a country to begin talks following an invitation. I have more research to do. For now I am leaning toward 0 since a number of things would have to happen for talks to begin by April and these processes are usually slow."

Each of the former nations do not meet portions of the general criteria or have disputes with current NATO members.
