Some responding companies had only cancelled ""most"" and not ""all"" trips. So the question in context may be, for some, when will your policy against ""most"" international travel change -- not ""when will you resume any international travel whatsoever""? Of course, the language ""all"" international travel makes this question potentially confusing, since it might suggest, to some, that they need to resume ""all"" international travel to answer yes (though I am not saying this would be a majority interpretation). And the multiple choice options are really designed to push respondents to say ""no"" unless they really have an actual, concrete plan. There are three options for non-yes responses, including ""no definite plans,"" ""do not plan,"" and ""not sure."" As others have noted, the universe of respondents change as some companies exit the pool, having developed concrete plans in earlier months, leaving a smaller and qualitatively different pool of respondents."

Vaccinated business travels will be resistent to it, and so they will travel. If you are vaccinated then you may travel. Countries opening their borders will be the issue. Overcoming the politics of opening borders might be problematic. There is also a chance that the prediction the virus has run its evolutionary course is wrong.

Many companies have determined it necessary to keep remote work [at least] an option in the US through the end of the ""summer"", so I find 20% a reachable goal, but perhaps unlikely at this point. Even if the US continues its vaccination program going as is, and the UK and Israel continue their efforts, there will be many countries that can't keep up.

Plus are employers going out on a limb and force their workfore to travel and make themselves gettting sued? I believe the composition of the membership of GBTA - havent found anything unfortunately - is essential as well. No asian countries are members where the pandemic seems to be handled better and cross border business travel resumed earlier which would make the number jumb acrouss the hurdle easily. Europe especially Germany is not getting a hold on the pandemic and domestic and international travel is restricted severly with quarantines in place etc. Which makes it less likely again. My hope is to kickstart the economy but a realistic perception is, that this aint happening anytime soon in Europe. Is the part of members and those taking part in the survey in the US , where vaccination is more successful sufficient to get it above the necessary 20 % threshold larger than in the US? There is one document by the GBTA https://www.gbta.org/Portals/0/Documents/gbta-poll-results-031821.pdf on Page 4 where the people taking part in the March edition of the poll are asked if they planning non-essential international business travel and 39 % - twice as much as required in the question - state that in the second half of 2021 they will do.

Plus question 21 in the above mentioned document refers to the near future longer than 3 month so something 3 to 9 month which partyl would cover the time until September.

It seems the majority of members should be from wealthy (OECD) countries that should have higher rates of vaccination, and the bulk of their travel should be within wealthy countries, which should be rated as safer for travel. This also means vaccine passports will be influential in the prevalence of travel. With the EU aiming to have passports in effect by summer (June 21) and a target of 70% vaccination by end of summer, it seems reasonable to assume the US will be targeting a similar (or more aggressive) timeline. Even a delay in this program could mean it being implemented by fall, which fits wit a 1-3 month horizon (ie. resuming travel by late Nov). With this in mind, barring a significant mutation that is resistant to current vaccinations, it seems highly probably that 20% international travel intentions will occur before Sept. 2021"

Therefore, I assume a majority proportion of GBTA's membership are US-based companies. The latest estimates (mid-Feb) for vaccine roll-out in the US are for a majority of Americans to be vaccinated by the end of summer, with ~20% of US adults having received at least one dose as at 27 Feb. ~80% of GBTA members are very or somewhat comfortable travelling for business after being vaccinated. On the other hand, vaccine roll-out has been slower than expected in the US and travel restrictions may remain in place in many western countries throughout the northern hemisphere summer - e.g. Visit UK is forecasting only 29% of inbound travelers for 2021 relative to 2019 as at Jan 2021, citing Covid variants as a risk to travel resumption. That said, it seems significantly more likely than not that the proportion of business in the travel industry who are planning to resume travel in the next 3 months will rise by 13 percentage points by late summer."

Nearly, every person I know who travelled more than 25%+ with their job pre-pandemic does not expect to travel at all within the next 6 months."
