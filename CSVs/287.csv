15045,2021-12-08T16:22:29Z,2,[60.0],[10.0],Increasing my forecast due to Australia joining in the boycott and some gentle pressure from the US ambassador:

Of those countries, Canada has arguably the best record on Human Rights.

Probability will increase the more other countries join like Australia - but- the UK is consistent in saying they don't boycott sporting events (repeated by Boris J in PMQT today) and I think Canada will probably follow a similar tack.

I think the US government will weigh in behind the scenes and encourage them to do so, while China will threaten and cajole them on the matter. I think ultimately they will follow the US lead, knowing Trudeau's showiness on issues of human rights and equality. It would probably take a much-heavier-handed approach by Beijing with aggressive threats of economic sanctions to compel their attendance. Indeed, such an approach may backfire and only convince Her Majesty's government in Canada that they cannot let China bribe and blackmail its way to acquiescence."
