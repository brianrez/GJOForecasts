Felony is a 'serious crime' (vs. misdemeanor), so presumably that meets the test of 'criminal charges'. It's really ambiguous though what 'face criminal charges' means. Does that mean 'be convicted of' or 'charged with'? I'd say that 'face criminal charges' covers the broader 'charged with'. But since there is a bit of ambiguity, it would be nice to get a clarification. The other fatal accidents all involved the driver who was ostensibly 'in control of the vehicle' so I don't know how the firm could be charged.

I judge that ignoring this case, the chances of an accident for which criminal charges is then brought is extremely low - i.e. around 5%. However, it is possible that Vasquez faces charges for the 2018 incident (the Arizona prosecutor has ruled out charging Uber) and frustratingly, there's very little public information to determine this likelihood.
