Between the 2012 and 2016 presidential races, Trump received only 721 more votes than Romney. Similarly, between the 2014 and 2018 Wisconsin governor races, votes for Walker only ranged by around 40,000. Contrast this to the Democratic turnout: Obama received more than 230,000 more votes in 2012 than Clinton did in 2016; and Evers received around 200,000 more votes in 2018 than Burke did in 2014. This may signal that the Republican turnout is about the same, but that if Biden can get the Democrats to show up for him, he will win Wisconsin. Further, 2016 polls indicated a higher projected turnout for “other,” whereas current polls have “other” at much lower percentages. This may signal that the “other” from 2016 may be leaning Democrat. With current racial tensions going on throughout the state, it may prompt more Democrats in larger cities to turn out."

Further, Hillary Clinton lost by less than a percent in 2016, whereas Gary Johnson took home more than 3 percent. The rhetoric around Joe Biden seems less divisive among Democrats, particularly very progressive Democrats that voted Johnson over Clinton in 2016, so I believe there will be more of a vote split between the two candidates versus between three. Further, recent racial tensions spurred by the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha may encourage a larger turnout of Democrats (though it could also encourage a hearty turnout of Trump supporters, which is why I don't think a Biden win is guaranteed)."
