United States Fish and Wildlife Service concerns the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (FWS) designation of private land in Louisiana as critical habitat for the dusky gopher frog. Under the Endangered Species Act, property owners of critical habitat are barred from most uses of the property. In this case, the FWS designation requires the property owners to uproot trees and replace them with different species; halt timber management activities; and allow the land to be populated with frogs. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling that deferred to the FWS habitat designation. The Supreme Court's decision could turn on the degree of deference afforded the FWS, and what constitutes agency discretion."

The link below is to a podcast about this case. Richard A. Epstein of NYU is a guest. He's brilliant! I very much agree with his opinions about the proper approach to interpret law. In this case Epstein thinks that the Court is tasked with answering the wrong question. Anyway, I think the correct answer is 'yes,"" and that it is likely that the Court will get it right. However, there is a chance that the split (without Kavanaugh) will be 4-4, so 15% chance wrong decision or no decision this term"

While the Court seems to be divided along the natural fault line, the questions and answers aren't easy to read, since there are many interruptions. But in the end, I believe the Court, will side with Weyerhaeuser, especially when later, Judge Kavanaugh will be confirmed and join the Court. I could even see Justice Breyer concur with the majority, but writing his own opinion. (EDIT: but perhaps he could use what the government lawyer suggested to him, that since the conservation is in line with current usage, the designation of ""critical habitat"" isn't outlandish. In that case, he will side with the liberal Justices)."
