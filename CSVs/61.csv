Both are well-educated white men running in a moderate-Democrat blue collar region. Neither one seems to have any unique positions that don't align with their parties policies. However, the reason I have put more faith in the Democrat (Chris Deluzio) is because he is a veteran, and in American politics and society military service is a revered sign of status that goes a long way for most people. Furthermore, the Republican candidate (Jeremy Shaffer) has not received an endorsement from Donald Trump. While Trump's endorsement does not count for as much as it used to, in Virginia voters saw it as a contributing factor to Republican-Glenn Youngkin's victory in a purple state. While Shaffer has expressed his desire for an endorsement from the former President, if he does not receive formal support from Trump I don't think he can garner enough support from the party to come out on top."
