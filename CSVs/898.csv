The S&P would have to drop over 223 points this week to be at or below +15% and while this week may be close to that there still seems to be a good deal of hope of a return to near normal in the summer."

Now obviously that is no guarantee, but considering how strong the economy was before COVID-19 pandemic, it is my opinion that much of the drop was due to overpricing in the market before hand. With so much uncertaintly, investors will react positively to good news, which as of 4/8/20 (the writing of this post), there has not been much of. With that said, the S&P 500 is already up to 2700 (~10% above that 2400 mark). There has been a ton of volatility, so this will likely drop back down at some point, but I feel confident that it will be above or around that 2400 mark by June 19th."

A 15 percent increase puts the index at 2760. Covid 19 should be in remission with trepidation about winter return. Oil prices will still be below 40 dollars since inventories are filling quickly. Air travel will stil be in the toilet. Consumer spending may be up with the free mkney but that won't last long. Fed may raise rates but they are so low financials will still return little. Real estate may shine and health care too. So i expect a quick rebound but not too spetacular.
