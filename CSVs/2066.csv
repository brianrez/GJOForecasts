1450,2015-12-30T20:56:52Z,1,[91.0],[91.0],"I put the base rate of compliance with international agreements as pretty high, 95%. This is politically sensitive, though reducing the likelihood. However, to overcome this would require one of two conditions: Iran to not comply and the EU to retaliate, or the US to decide to comply with the JCPOA. Iranian hardliners decide to hold back (overriding the Supreme Leader, 10%), they either declare this (low probablity-5%) or are detected (slightly higher-25%), EU retaliates (75%). This = .09 US option: Republicans decide to block the agreement during election year (50%, some would like to, but this is risky in an election year), they are able to build a coalition strong enough to override Presidential veto (10%). =5%. This would require a lot of collective gumption and risk acceptance. There is also a wild card option of something destabilizing the US-Iran-EU relationship. This is a non-trivial chance given the general instability in the region (say Iranian-backed Shia militias unilaterally attack US bases in Baghdad for example). push this down to 85% overall Iran's shipment of their Uranium stocks to Russia increases the likelihood of overall compliance-push back up to 91%"

Provided that Adoption Day occurs as soon as 16 October (as speculated in the Iranian press) that leaves 9 1/2 months for all of the residual issues to be addressed and resolved. While this appears to be a generous time frame, one must always remember that all generally does not go according to Hoyle. OTOH, there is every incentive for the Iranians to cooperate and reduce the timeline as much as practible to Implimentation Day. Even Rouhani has gone optimistic as @cmeinel has noted previously, stating that he expects the full lifting of sanctions to occur within 2 months of Adoption Day. In balance, a 9 1/2 month timeframe may sound reasonable for resolution, but I think not. There are a number of political components to achieving this resolution process, so I am going to back off the general consensus a bit and recalibrate as necessary. @walt gives it a 1 in 3 probability, I will go at 2 in 3."

68,2015-09-15T08:23:26Z,1,[95.0],[95.0],"This is probably the first financial restriction Iran will want lifted, even more than the return of its own money currently frozen overseas. Iran will do everything needed to expedite this. From what I can make out, the earliest this can happen is six months from late October, so there are a further three months to deal with hitches along the way. Unless there are serious and unexpected disagreements between the parties as to interpretation of some clauses of the Agreement, this is almost certain."
38,2015-09-15T04:50:12Z,1,[90.0],[90.0],"I need to read more about this, but isn't the lifting of these restrictions at the top of Iran's wishlist?"
43,2015-09-15T03:23:25Z,2,[90.0],[-5.0],"Backing off a bit, given that ""Implementation Day"" when SWIFT will readmit Iranian banks is not totally under Iranian control. However, the news story below indicated it should not take longer than nine months. Given the importance to Iran, to the extent that Iran can control the timeline, it should be sooner."
43,2015-09-15T03:07:33Z,1,[95.0],[95.0],The Iran nuclear deal going through implies SWIFT reintegration to high likelihood. Currently Iran and North Korea are the only nations banned from SWIFT. So it beggars belief to imagine that SWIFT sanctions would remain against Iran as soon as the new nuclear deal is finalized. Wildcard: Iranian hardliners succeed in scuttling the deal. I will raise probability as soon as that hurdle is past.
182,2015-09-15T02:46:31Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],"In order for the Iranian economy to fully reintegrate, they must have SWIFT access. If they are cooperative then it will happen within this timeframe. It is to everyone's advantage that the Iranians reintegrate except for the Iranian leadership. Once sanctions are lifted and the economy begins to improve there will be no one but the government to blame if the lives of average Iranians does not improve. I wonder if Tehran has considered this as an unintended consequence of the deal?"

""SWIFT is putting the onus on the EU to assume the burden of the decision of whether Iran will be reintegrated into its system. So, upon “Implementation Day” — when the International Atomic Energy Agency verifies that Iran has fulfilled the implementation of specified nuclear measures — the EU will be obliged to order SWIFT to readmit Iran’s banks."" http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/07/17/it-just-got-easier-for-iran-to-fund-terrorism-swift-bank/ Implementation day should be in 1H of 2016: http://www.ecfr.eu/article/iran_explainer3070"

There are numerous provisions that Iran will need to meet, and it seems likely that every possible violation of the requirements will be thoroughly investigated, delays should be expected. Iran will work to remove sanctions as quickly as possible, but all of the deals opponents will make the final removal of sanctions as complicated as possible."
20,2015-09-14T22:58:25Z,1,[65.0],[65.0],"Lawfare article gives the list of what Iran and IAEA have to do before this sanction gets lifted.
