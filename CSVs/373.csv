The main argument I’ve seen for why this would be is related to the spatial and social compartmentalization of the US, and the need for the virus to “jump” into new sub-populations before it can continue to spread. This process would cause some delay in the onset/growth rate of the wave that would make a bin #2 outcome pretty difficult to achieve (only 2 weeks left), given today’s case counts."

In favor of 200k by the end of the year (bin 2): * Omicron is spreading widely, and Delta + Omicron cases may actually reach >> 200k/day. * Many locations have little to no restrictions in place. * People aren't changing their behaviors much and still don't anticipate the speed of exponential spread. In favor of bin 3 instead: * Testing and reporting go way down during the holidays. Reported cases fell 25% over Thanksgiving, despite actual cases rising. Last year, reported cases fell 18% over Christmas and New Year's, despite actual cases rising. * Perhaps related to the point above, could testing capabilities become saturated in some locations? * Locations could put substantial restrictions in place. * Omicron may not be as widespread as I think it likely is."

I think bin 3 is extremely likely as Omicron spreads faster than people can imagine. It looks to be almost as contagious as chickenpox. But so many people have already made up their minds that they're not going to take Covid seriously, and I suspect a lot of states/counties/etc. aren't going to put restrictions in place, including some with leaders who would be inclined to do so but won't for political reasons. So, I fear that very little existing immunity + winter + Omicron being just slightly less contagious than chickenpox = huge spread. I fear mitigations won't come until things are way out of control, because that will likely happen very quickly. It is interesting to me that the crowd currently assigns 29% probability to 200k cases being reached between Jan 1 and Feb 28; I don't see how it will be avoided.

This will be the first winter season with most restrictions lifted, but with vaccines available. As summer cases were higher in 2021 than summer 2020 (after governments lifted restrictions), COVID is widely in circulation, and more infectious than the flu, I predict reaching 200,000 cases in December for the 7 day moving average is likely.

If 100 cases were present in the US as of 11/27/21 and the doubling time is 5 days (one current estimate is 4.8d), then we could see ~100k cases/day by the end of January. But I don't rule out Delta putting us over 200k cases/day by the end of the year. I also don't think Omicron is the only variant that may spread well in the US. For example, it's possible that Omicron could turn out to escape nearly all neutralizing antibody immunity but be barely more transmissible than the ancestral variant, while some other variant (B.1.1.640? Others?) could turn out to escape some intermediate portion of existing antibody immunity but be more transmissible than Omicron. Which would spread more quickly in the US (and elsewhere), and how much would they spread? And what restrictions would be put in place to limit their spread (probably not much)?"

A commonly encountered interpretation of this observation is that there is 1) a lull in testing / strong incentive to delay seeking medical treatment until directly after the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays while families are gathered; 2) significantly increased chances for new infections driven by large numbers of people traveling together in confined spaces and gathering indoors for festivities with trusted family members. This explains the apparent dip in cases coinciding with the specific holiday dates and the strong rebound in cases beyond previous highs thereafter."

The two ""compound"" peaks observed so far are 6-7 months apart. - The current new infection rate during the ongoing ""compound peak"" (Sep21) is now at ~150k/day, although this value has been stagnant for a while now.

Moreover, Delta is making its way through the population at the moment, and will likely cause a much smaller peak of cases this winter as population immunity reaches levels >90%. In addition, one or more new variants capable of taking Delta's place have not clearly emerged. In short, I don't see a strong case for >200k in bin 2, but it's possible. If one or more new variants emerge, perhaps even sublineages of Delta, then bins 2 or 3 could be possible, although a variant that substantially escapes existing immunity would be required imo. We're in uncharted territory here. Will cases start to settle down once nearly everyone in the US has some form of immunity? As for bin 1, I don't think we'll see >200k before Nov. 1 because I think the Delta wave will generally be winding downwards between now and Oct. 31 (with perhaps an additional, lower peak between now and then). I think bin 4 would require a variant with extreme immune escape."
