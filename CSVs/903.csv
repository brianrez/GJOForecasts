The militarization of Iran’s public health efforts demonstrates how Khamenei and his allies have shrewdly used the outbreak to sideline the government of President Hassan Rouhani and increase their grip over the country’s population ... Iran’s leadership initially minimized the contagion’s risks and severity to avoid jeopardizing voter turnout during the country’s parliamentary elections, and Khamenei’s surrogates refused to restrict access to high-traffic religious shrines ... According to Iran’s constitution, the supreme leader has a lifetime appointment as the highest political and religious power in the land, controlling the armed forces and the security apparatus, and sitting above the president, who serves a four-year term, and the Majlis, having the ability to quash policies not in line with the ideological goals of the theocracy."" https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/05/27/irans-strategy-fighting-covid-19-could-backfire/"

Yet, President Hassan Rouhani's government has been widely criticized for responding appropriately to the COVID-19 emergency (https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/israeli-government-warns-fatalities-virus-numbers-rise-69658922). Signalling lack of faith in the Rouhani government, Khamenei ordered the military to take charge of the situation. Rouhani refused to accept the change, and a standoff has ensued, with the military outright ignoring his orders (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/world/middleeast/coronavirus-iran-rouhani.html).

Preventing large groups meeting is a textbook authoritarian tactic for preventing conspiracy to overthrow a leader. The virus also gives an excuse for extraordinary measures to be taken under the guise of public health. The drop in oil prices does put a strain on finances, and thus opens an opportunity for change, though the next leader would not have any easier of a time paying off his inner circle. So, a popular uprising seems very unlikely, but an internal coup could be possible, at least as an outside chance which I will put at 1 in 25, split evenly among all yes's. That takes care of the ""Yes, both..."" cases. One-year mortality is about 6.2% for Khamenei and 2.7% for Rouhani. Those pro-rate to 5% and 2%, rounded to the nearest percent. If Khamenei dies, I'll give a 50% chance to Rouhani succeeding him."

Khamenei is an old man and two of his aids tested positive for coronavirus. Rouhani is 70 so vulnerable as well. Khamenei has put Rouhani and the Army in charge of the coronavirus fight. If that does not go well he could be tossed under the bus. I see movement in Iran asking the IMF for money. That would not happen without Khamenei’s approval. Khamenei may gave to be more cooperative with the West to save his economy and job. Rouhani could indeed be a scapegoat. Reassess in a month.
