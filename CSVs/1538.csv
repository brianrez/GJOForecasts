First, you have a pretty bipartisan agreement that there should being something done about bump stocks. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿At the same however, in terms of how to go about banning bump stocks has been less compromising. The Democratic party has introduced a bill back in October that would completely and efficiently ban bump stocks and the language involved in the bill is pretty straightforward and carefully crafted where the law wouldn't apply to other weaponry thus ""taming"" adherent 2nd Amendment supports. The Republican Party, with the statement from Speaker Ryan, propose that such banning action take place under the jurisdiction of Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). As mentioned in the link to the Washington Post article, this move could do the Republican platform and firearm ideology more harm than good. Very recently in March, Trump signed an executive order that instructed the Attorney General to regulate the devices. In conclusion, my answer to this question is at a 12% yes because I consider the question to include Congressional legislature governance. I think there is a good chance for such a bill to pass because of the recent momentum the debate of gun control has erupted in. http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/03/23/what-are-bump-stocks-how-work-and-why-trump-wants-them-banned.html https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/10/doj-moves-outlaw-bump-stocks-making-them-illegal-own-sell/413237002/"

If you want a fully automatic weapon submit the necessary paperwork and purchase one. I've personally used the bump stock on several occasions and even though its marketed as a novelty and doesn't always function correctly its main purpose is to put as much lead downrange in as little time as possible. The NRA is feeling some pressure from the usual sources and needs to back up sensible bills that in all reality need to be laws. Violence committed using guns will never stop regardless but I think they would actually gain followers by backing the ban on bump stocks.

Its a very complex problem. Taking action to reduce mass shooting is not complex (reducing the availability of guns, especially to high risk categories of people, works in other countries so there is no reason to believe it would not reduce mass shootings in the US). The complex problem is working out why so many Americans choose to believe that it is better to have lax gun controls at a cost of frequent mass shootings, rather than more effective gun control and less shootings. But then why do Trump and his supporters choose to believe that trade wars are a good thing and easily won, when the evidence suggests otherwise? And (to correct any anti-American bias) why do Brexiteers in the UK believe the UK will gain from leaving the EU when all the evidence suggest the opposite? Why do they continue to believe the EU is only motivated by economic rationality (so the EU will give the UK a good trade deal because a bad trade deal would cost the UK economy a lot, and the EU economy a little) when the Brexiteers are not themselves motivated by economic rationality (if they were they would not be want to leave the EU, Single Market and Customs Union). Clearly the age of rationality has not yet arrived. Maybe the legal system and commerce will eventually solve the problem. A state has a duty of care to its citizens. Citizens have a right to life and a right to not fear for their safety. If the state fails to take reasonable steps to care for its citizens, citizens should have legal redress. Like wise businesses have a duty to not harm citizens, if a business invests in, makes or sells products that damage citizens it has a duty to take reasonable steps to mitigate the risk of that damage."
