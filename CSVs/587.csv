An alternative referendum route exists for approving constitutional reforms, but reforms affecting government revenue and spending are not be eligible.

Mexico would appear to be in a mess. Economically Mexico was in recession prior to the Covid pandemic that has further deepened the economy by 18.9% by the second quarter. The handling of the pandemic has resulted in 133,000 deaths – one of the world’s highest. In 2019 there were 34,500 reported homicides with 2020 even worse. Mexico is ranked 130 out of 198 in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) President López Obrador has possibly seen a possible distraction from his fall in popularity and the countries woes by using the expose by the discredited ex-head of Pemex (National Oil Company) Emilio Lozoya of implicating previous Presidents, including aides and lawmakers, Felipe Calderón – president from 2006 until 2012 – and Carlos Salinas – from 1988 to 1994 of corruption, cronyism and increasing the concentration of wealth for themselves and families. Lopez has stated that five former presidents, Carlos Salinas, Ernesto Zedillo, Vicente Fox, Felipe Calderon and Enrique Pena Nieto should stand trial for corruption, concentration of wealth etc. and that the Mexican people should decide. Mexico’s Supreme court have approved Lopez’s plan to hold a referendum on whether the previous presidents should be held to account, without naming them. Referendums are considered to be dangerous by the political class as it places decision(s) in the hands of the populace, but Lopez might see this as a distraction to bolster his anti-corruption credentials. 50% for the distraction, 50% as he is unpopular"

Only major issue would be COVID [3] and the very high number of deaths. So, reasons for this could be to condition the results of the midterm elections to his personal charisma (his party, Morena, doesn't seem to be doing too bad, and no other party seems to be closing the gap [1]) or first step to change his six year term [4].
