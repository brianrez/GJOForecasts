My approach was to average between 538 and bettings odds. The betting odds were closer to the eventual truth than 538 and thus I was my Brier is better than somebody who followed 538. Still, that wasn't enough to beat the GJO median. This is in contrast to the FIFA question where following 538 actually led to better-than-median scores. Perhaps this question was an outlier because of the small number of forecasters. Or perhaps one should avoid sports questions if it is hard to consistently beat the median on those due to perhaps the ready availability of great sources like 538."
