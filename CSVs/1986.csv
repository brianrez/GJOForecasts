As I reevaluate this question I started out at 7% owing my low forecast to FARC culture and their symbols of cultural identity which ultimately brought me to a no ""final"" peace deal would be signed. But then an announcement of President Obama and Sec Kerry would be visiting Cuba a couple days before the FARC/Columbia self imposed deadline for a ""final peace deal"" and I could not ignore the significance of this visit. I really thought this could be accomplished and a final peace deal would be signed. I over estimated two of the four (DIME) powers of American power; Diplomacy and Economics. We still have time left on this GJ question...not ruling out some kind of a deal but there will not be a ""final deal""."

Examples of other government-rebel peace discussions that missed deadlines do not provide distinct trends for the length of negotiations after a missed deadline. Additionally, commentators on the FARC peace negotiations range in their belief that the sides will come to agreement, with some saying as early as June and others saying by the end of 2016. Additionally, it is not clear how often negotiations are being held at this time or what the announcement of the ELN talks will do to the FARC discussions. Despite that, the length of the negotiations thus far, and the outstanding issues including still getting a ceasefire agreement, provide little reassurance that they will be completed within the timeline of the question."

It is unlikely that a negotiation strategy by the Colombian government will take two paths for each rebel/guerilla contestation. The negotiations in fact will become more complicated and protracted in that the negotiations will need to take account for the demands & concessions of three parties. Conflict between FACR and ELN has a long history along with their cooperation with the Colombian government over time. A final negotiated solution would require a meeting of minds in compromise as well as a stabilized demobilization plan (which is currently the most difficult of all issues). Demands by any side would have to renegotiated where agreement has previously reached. The larger the size of the negotiation group, the larger the number of interactions are required to get to a signed peace accord. May 2016 might still be too early to reach a settlement among the parties."

I was a real optimist a while ago, but I think it will take longer.offcourse any thing is possible in Colombia but It seems the leaders may delay final agreement. I think in South America we are a bit more relaxed and dates usually get delayed any ways . Importance is reaching the agreement not a set date. It may take a bit longer. Pledges are for publicity and a line in the sand. A fitting date would be the international workers day on May 1. So possible as far as the symbolism but unlikely in reality. Those are my thoughts currently ."

Peace will not be finalized if the issue of amnesty and extradition remains open. It will take a while for the Colombian Congress to draft legislation that would legalize such measures within the transitional courts. It should be noted that the Santos Government would have simple majority support if it decides to push for amnesty and non-extradition and a simple majority is all that is required to pass such legislation. Also, 8 FARC members were just arrested, and I believe this will hinder progress more than help it. (Unless those arrested are high ranking enough to be used as bargaining chips to draw major concessions from the FARC. Initial reports don't indicate this to be the case though)"

The statement comes after Santos admitted for the first time on Wednesday that the talks will not wrap up before March 23 and that the government is not willing to sign a deal prematurely just in order to meet the deadline. . . . ""But despite the progress, the much anticipated March 23 deadline, whose hype was amped up by the planned visit by U.S. President Barack Obama in Colombia from March 20 to 22, has been deemed impossible. The U.S. has long financed Colombia's counterinsurgency strategy against the FARC. No new date has been set publicly for when Colombia can now expect to announce the end of five decades of civil war and the beginning of peace.""

The gov. is still facing the left-wing ELN and strong right-wing rebelgroups and needs it resources for them. Therefore that approach may be too risky. Furthermore, Santos political 'destiny' seems to be pretty much bound to the conclusion of a peace deal by now. He is facing a strong opposition and harsh criticism for these talks.

It seems that Santos is often criticized for strong-arming whatever he wants through the legislature, so the plebiscite is a gesture to public opinion. The other issue is the United States' list of terrorist organizations and threats to extradite about 50 FARC members wanted on drug trafficking charges. Santos has prevented extradition in the past, but it's unclear if he will be able to get a blanket commitment from the US not to pursue it. US has said that FARC will not be removed from terrorist list until after they give up arms, so the order in which things need to be done may be an obstacle. Even so, if Santos can get some promises from the US, and the FARC negotiators trust him, there could be an agreement before May."

So, the government will take some time to delineate the agreeement (and have it reviewed by judicial authorities), align it with las Farc leadership, organise and perform the referendum, make results public and (in case las Farc does not raise any complaints) proceed with the transitional program. That is a lot of work to get done in a 2.5 months time window."

Leading negotiators for FARC have indicated publicly in Cuba during its recent negotiations with the Colombian ruling government that its (government) of a March deadline to complete all outstanding issues in the negotiations is naive, unreasonable and illusive. A significant component yet to negotiated is the creating and establishment (which all agree would take at least a decade or more) of a sustainable economy in the FARC controlled territory among the landless, peasants and other classes. Its illusive tasks are made difficult in that it needs to find an economy that can sustain and surpass the economic benefits of a narcoterrorist economy (cocaine). With the additional two month requirement established by this question (beyond March) does not make an agreement more possible; beside agreement substantively differs from signing an agreement. The Colombian government is still beset with problems of regarding the ELN (a major guerilla organization) with whom it has no history of negotiations. This dispels the fantasy that ongoing conflict interactions between it and the government, it and FARC could present significantly more dangers to a peace process, were it to be achieved. So the question remains, given the status quo, or a move to FARC agreement and military integration, and the creation of an economy that is able to sustain a large population of FARC supporters and members in its territory, will peace move Colombia into an abyss much more aggressive than it current status. At this posting, escalation in military conflict continues between the government and the ELN."

However, I think a survey of history would suggest that an agreement of this magnitude slips even further. I tried to find some analysis on analogous situations (e.g., Northern Ireland), but didn’t discover. Therefore, I don’t have data to evaluate my hypothesis, but I’m willing to let it inform my forecast nonetheless. I think a peace agreement will be reached sometime this year, but given the comments and reactions since December, I think this is likely to go past May 1. Deadlines can harden positions as much as they can encourage resolution, and I think typically deadlines encourage resolution when a powerful third party is establishing them. There are a number of interested external parties, the US foremost among them, but I don't know if the Obama Administration has the bandwidth to midwife this peace agreement by May 1."

The three remaining points are the treatment of victims, the end of conflict (including the standing down of both FARC soldiers and paramilitary groups) and finally implementation. These points are tricky and may be very difficult to manage."
