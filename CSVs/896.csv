There will be more hesitation to go as hard fighting the outbreak with something like a stay at home-order. I am on the other hand doubtful because of the revenue that coachella brings. i might be over studying this. https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2020.20224 https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/10/10/515

You´re right about that too (I got a nice accuracy score in the question about the Olympics for exactly that strategy, but that one was the other way around: I could start with high percentages and later reduce them if necessary (which wasn´t) without fear of early resolution). Will go higher up, anything else is gambling. But I still believe, that there is a 50:50 chance for a partial event, so not too high (80% is just ""risk management"" for averaging the forecasts of the last weeks), hoping to go down from that later…"

By the way: a first (although very small) online music festival has already happened here in Germany. And I´ve participated in business training online a week ago. There were five times more participants to it than usually travelled to the original event in Munich. And there´s a chance for a live event too. Life will be better then. Give Coachella a chance. I will attend online, if they offer it there :-) Risking all the scores of the past: going down to 10% on this one just for the fun of it."

It's also possible we just take the L and give up completely on trying to stop it, but I also don't see that as very likely."

It can also be reduced to a controllable version (the question asks for a full cancellation). Nobody needs to attend at Coachella, it can be done and marketed over the internet.

Furthermore, to what degree will a) would-be concert goers and b) the local populace want to congregate en masse with other travelers and tourists? If this gets worse before the situation improves, there may not be much of a market for festival tickets. Of course, if they are smart, a plan b could be to host a ""broadcast only"" festival. For the time being, my gut is cautiously expecting the world to look quite different in October."
