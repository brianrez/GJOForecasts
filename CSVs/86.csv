While Bennet may be facing a galvanized moderate Republican candidate in what will likely be a tough election cycle for Democrats, he previously eked out at slim victory in the disastrous (for Democrats) 2010 midterm elections. Democrats have also won 4 out of the last 5 Senate races in Colorado and the state has gone for a Democratic candidate in every Presidential election since 2008 (https://www.270towin.com/states/Colorado). Given Colorado’s move toward the left and his previous electoral successes, I put Bennet’s probability of reelection at 90%."

But I am in skeptic mode because @MrLittleTexas says, ""Bennet has never won with more than 50% of the vote, and the GOP candidate is a moderate pro choice businessman without any Trump or Jan 6 baggage."" In addition, polls across the country has seen an increase in confidence of the Republican Party to handle key issues while confidence in the Democratic Party has gone down. The Senate elections as a whole is more uncertain than the House elections. But I remain on the Democratic bias because my forecast for the US Senate winning a majority leans more toward the Democratic Party."
