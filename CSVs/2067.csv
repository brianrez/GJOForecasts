Biden is therefore raising this moot, dead issue for some kind of political purpose. Why now? Why this issue? Because it draws a contrast between the VP and the then-Secretary of State. That would be Hillary Clinton. 3. What is that contrast? Biden deliberately leaves the actual decision in a gray area, repeatedly framing it as ""49 [% vs.] 51 [%]"". The only real difference between his view and those of the other cabinet officials is their _relationship to the president_. Biden was in a superior, more intimate, more powerful and influential position than any other Cabibet member. 4. Biden explicitly says that his motivation was to support the president."

Evidence: Biden is the only U.S. senator who has never accumulated a fortune; never sought or received a lucrative private equity/investment or consulting or lobbying position; never sought to cash in on his fame via five- or six-figure lectures or million-dollar book royalties, or any other profit-seeking venture. He is 100% a political animal, perhaps the last remaining such figure in our national political life. 2. He has plenty of time to win: the notion that it's too late to enter and win is unsupported by logic or evidence. First, Biden's campaign apparatus can easily and rapidly raise money, and in any case his name recognition is already high enough that he needs less advertising spend than any other candidate, in either party. Secondly, it is the Democratic Party's superdelegates, not the Party rank-and-file voters, who determine the nominee. These are ruthlessly pragmatic professionals who simply want to win the presidency. Most have no particular loyalty to the Clintons. More than a few are intensely loyal to Obama, and still harbor bitter feelings over the 2008 race. These superdelegates would gladly switch to Obama's most loyal ally (and his likely designated heir). 3. Biden's model here is Bobby Kennedy (RFK), another high-profile executive branch figure who jumped into the race in March 1968 and quickly vaulted to the forefront - even though Kennedy was a far more divisive and controversial figure. Like Biden, RFK had zero interest in money and was motivated instead by lifelong, burning ambition, stoked in part by personal resentment of a Democratic rival. Biden probably does not resent the Clintons to anywhere near the degree that RFK hated Lyndon Johnson, but he is a politician through and through. Biden knows that he is a far better politician than Hillary Clinton and that he was the force behind most of the major achievements of the Obama administration (including the extraordinarily successful rescue of GM, the prevention of financial collapse, and the passage of the stimulus bill in the face of Republican obstructionism). The party's superdelegates also know that Hillary is a weak candidate with no better than a 50-50 chance of defeating Rubio or Bush, both of whom Biden would easily defeat through a combination of very high African-American turnout and white working-class support across Ohio, the rest of the industrial heartland and the other battleground states. Biden wants the presidency, and he will announce well before Thanksgiving. 75% odds that he announces by noontime ET Monday Nov. 2."

So unless she has a stroke before Thanksgiving the only reason for him to get in the race is personal (""win one for Beau"")."

Do we believe Hillary can overcome the FBI investigation on the server and any fallout from CGI? Will she be vindicated and will the controversy be dropped or buried? She can appear on stage and smile, perform a decent debate, campaign. (what happens to her when she appears in the homes in Iowa and New Hampshire?). IF we believe she will overcome and rise to the surface unscathed, Joe *need not* run. IF we believe she will fall on her sword in the Benghazi questioning, be indicted or at least dragged down by the FBI investigations then the Dem. party may find that Joe *needs* to run. I say she falls on her sword, FBI finds she broke the law. I may be partisan but those are moving targets that may prove to become facts. Raising 10% to 69% that Joe (Dem Party) will find it necessary to run. Not that he's perfect, but he has a nice family :)"

The debate did everyone who was on the stage, other than Clinton and Sanders, no good at all. Webb, Chafee and O'Malley will join Perry and Walker sooner rather than later. Clinton was her usual prepared self, and Sanders didn't implode. As much as I hate to say it, this race has ended, though Sanders may stick around to get convention time. Saying the nomination is hers to lose, however, does leave an opening for someone else. Someone who could step in should disaster (political or otherwise) strike. That's Biden. He doesn't need to lift a finger to keep that position, and would probably lose it if he did."

I still think there's a chance he'll declare, because he's always wanted to be President, and he won't get another shot at it. Moreover, it's clear that none of the other Democrats in the race are even remotely credible as candidates. Biden's best shot is to go after Hillary on emails, Benghazi, conflicts of interest, etc., because even if the Democrats won't go after her (and they didn't) the Republicans will. So her vulnerabilities remain, but are masked until the general election. This is not good for the Democratic party. It's better that she address these questions now, rather than wait for (probably) Ted Cruz to bring them up next year. If Biden enters, calls her on her vulnerabilities, and Hillary can't come up with satisfactory answers, Biden gets the nomination. I might add that this works for anybody, for example Warren, but the question is about Biden."

He could only repeat their positions in a different manner. Hillary still has a hearing before Gowdy's committee later this month, but that whole thing looks like it's starting to fall apart what with staffers toasting their ""Glacial Pace"" and all.

But I had no access other than tips to other participant comments, links and forecast numbers. So what I've learned so far this year, is I tend to throw caution to the wind and forecast either super high or super low, compared to superforecasters. I kind of think in terms of ""yes"" or ""no"". I believe this is called being a hedgehog. All the self-identified superforecasters (that's right, I'm following you all, and I'm following all the people you follow, at least for now.) Anyway, all of the superforecasters DO NOT DO THIS. They all seem to start much closer to the middle and then gradually move to either side. So I am going to moderate my forecast down. I am learning! I think this means I will probably no longer have the big hits, but my overall performance over long term will be more even and improve in accuracy. Please correct me if I'm wrong. Back to this forecast. I am feeling super ambivalent here. I originally thought Biden would declare by the first debate, and otherwise it could wait till after Christmas or longer. Now, I see by austerity's link that he is not expected to debate, and is not preparing for it. So, why am I not drastically lowering my forecast like I originally intended? 1. the writer states Biden will declare if he is running in the last half of October. (Not clear why author thinks that time frame.) 2. Clinton faces the committee on Oct 22, and also we still haven't seen the final aftermath of the email scandal, the results of which may further weaken her race, and potentially strengthen Biden's. If she tanks, the Dems will have to have another strong candidate. Part of me thinks her polls are the the counterweight to Biden not running. If she sinks, he will rise. 3. His friends are still 50/50 whether he will run or not, there has been no shift, no strong indication either way 4. In Biden's Sept 17 interview, I heard for the first time an indication he may run when Biden said, ""So, no matter what we do, all of us, as a family, are going to stay engaged and work on those things that Beau inspired people to care about. And so — in doing that in public, quite frankly, is the best way to avoid what we all feel self­conscious about. We feel self­conscious about the focus on us. I don’t want anybody feeling sorry for me, or the families. Again, so many people have gone through so much more, with so much less support, yet they get up every morning, father, and you saw it. They put one foot in front of the other, and they move on. My dad used to have an expression. Whenever you got knocked down, whether it was a football field, or you got turned down for the date, or you didn’t win the prize, or something bad happened to you, he’d say two things: “Joey, where’s it written that life owes you a living?” And the next one was, “Just get up, pal. Get up.” And that’s what Beau wants us to do. That’s what Beau expects his father to do. So we’re just getting up and moving on. We’re going to do good things, in his name."" to me, that sounds like he is starting to rally, and considering his next moves, and I also remember that Beau wanted him to run for president. 5. If Biden was seriously NOT running, or more than 60% sure he was not running, wouldn't he have definitively put everyone out of their misery and supported Clinton by now? 6. Suspense and speculation at all time high, which means a boost for Biden now, but how long can the public can be strung along?"

Announcing at a time just to get in a debate could actually hurt him. He has postponed his announcement because of the pain from his son's death. He genuine about that. But if it appears for a moment that he was using his son's, playing politics with it - which he is absolutely NOT doing - it would ruin his campaign. He needs to be very careful and tactful about the timing of his announcement 2) He needs to appear to be the ""reluctant leader."" He can't appear to be rushing into the race, or look desperate. By continuing to postpone his entry in to the race, he's exuding confidence. When he enters, there will be no question he's in it for the good of the country, not just himself. Plus, right now he's still rising in the polls, so there's no advantage to jumping in. He's probably the most popular ""candidate"" right now - why fix what's not broken?

A politician changing his or her mind is not unusual.

The background noise, the telling signs of preparation, the support people and family ramping up… every indication, except from Biden himself, that he will run. The hopeful expectation is palpable. Just missing one personal epiphany for Biden. Changing my forecast to 98% for the next three weeks. Rationalization: the opportunity to participate in the first debate would be the only compelling reason to have to declare candidacy before Thanksgiving. If he is still waffling the way he is now and doesn’t declare by Oct. 11th, there is no compelling reason for him to rush the decision before Thanksgiving, and I will return to a low % forecast."

Biden presumably knows he can't get the nomination, and that the only way he can be a candidate is by attacking Clinton, there being no point in going after Sanders. The effect of this will be to weaken Clinton in the general, and I still think Uncle Joe is too good a party guy to wish this. Staying with the low number for now."

Then the word was floated with the idea of him running. But to keep him from running too soon, they had to come up with excuses for him not to run. If he stays out of the race for as long as possible he stays out of the cross hairs. The big question is whether or not he will announce before Thank giving.

Clinton Factor; I believe it's very intimidating for anyone to challenge her/machine.

I think the general public is only half aware that those emails WERE hacked by Guccifer, and if it ever really comes out, or some of the Wikileaks stuff about Monsanto, then I think she'll be buried and hopeless with her own base. I think there's some big questions about Biden's ability to win, more than Hillary's chance to win, which she is still perceived to have a stronger following, so once it becomes more clear that Hillary won't, or can't, then we'll see more movement on Biden.

Alcorn, contacted through Draft Biden, confirmed the breakfast with Torrey and said, “I can tell you that he wants to be very involved,” but could not remember whether he had compared him to Pritzker.

That's a complicated question, but the averaged polling data presented at Real Clear Politics shows that Hillary has been on a steady decline since mid July. The email scandal is gaining traction, and since its revelation her numbers on average have only gone up three times. If she continues this decline, at a 5-7% collapse each month, she'll be in the mid 30% by November. Part of that collapse means a movement of support towards the other candidates, most likely Sanders, which would mean that Biden's staff have to be wondering at what point her support becomes too low (and Sander's too high) for a Biden candidacy to be able to leap out of the gate and immediately get into the mid 30s as well. I think that cross-over point is going to appear in late October/early November, and so the decision will be made then to get in."

As was the case in 2007, however, Mrs. Clinton's campaign has managed to project inevitability as her primary strength. That is an unforgivable error, suggesting that the candidate (and her team) has a hard time learning the lessons of failure, an impression bolstered by her handling of e-mail while at the State Department. Is it any wonder that her support among educated white women, supposedly her true base, is slipping? ""Been there, done that."" With Sen. Sanders scooping up the portion of the [potential] Democratic electorate that propelled then-Sen. Obama to the forefront eight years ago, and a pox-on-both-houses buzz rising against another Clinton-Bush general election, an opening exists for a candidate who is both personally unconventional and of proven competence.

I think he honestly feels the intellectual and temperamental heir to Barack Obama. He is, objectively, the most experienced person in either party considering running. Whether he feels he is emotionally up to the challenge is very much the question. Based on what I saw on Colbert, I think he is honestly struggling very hard with the decision. Clinton's current wavering in the polls has got to be playing on his decision-making. This is very much a 50-50 proposition.

241,2015-09-15T02:18:31Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"Biden has run twice before and knows how difficult that will be. He's only going to do it if, to use a cliché, he feels he has fire in the belly. Based on his recent public appearances, I don't see that right now. Watch his interview with Stephen Colbert. Does he sound like a presidential candidate? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwmMPytjrK4 (skip to 3:20)."

I saw the interview and the man definitely connects. The email fiasco sandbagged Hillary early on and Bernie, although a great orator, maybe too far Left for most mainstream Democrats/Progressives. This maybe Biden's last shot and I think he'll take it."

830,2015-09-14T23:19:07Z,1,[95.0],[95.0],Although he may be hesitant getting older and very tired I think he will be reenergized soon #1 There is alot of weakness in the field of canidates. That will become more obvious #2 His son asked im to before he died. I was going to vote republican but would vote for him if he ran.
231,2015-09-14T23:13:05Z,1,[25.0],[25.0],Preparations are being made: http://www.kspr.com/news/politics/biden-advisers-eyeing-ballot-deadlines/21051736_35271186 But all signals from the man himself have been to indicate he's not running.
102,2015-09-14T22:32:49Z,2,[100.0],[5.0],"This one is too easy. Hillary's got a dent in her head, too much money from foreign lobbyists and too many emails to hide. There is no other credible Democratic contender. Uncle Joe is one of your more skilled used car salesmen.[1] It's him or Donald. Bernie Sanders is too Socialist for the mainstream. Donald is too much too much for he mainstream. I see Biden going the distance and winning."
2,2015-09-14T22:09:15Z,1,[65.0],[65.0],I think he's looking for a reason to. The insiders are trying to stop him from doing it.
20,2015-09-14T22:07:08Z,1,[60.0],[60.0],Nice link by Konstantin. Hard to see uncle Joe hanging it up after 40+ years in DC. But there are also good personal reasons. He would start out behind HRC and Bern too. A big challenge with a broken heart.

102,2015-09-14T20:49:37Z,1,[95.0],[95.0],Yes because of all the heartfelt TV moments where he's been crying about his son and wondering if he has the strength to go on. Plus Hillary's concept of private email for public officials would look shady for the village dogcatcher.
484,2015-09-14T20:42:53Z,1,[70.0],[70.0],"Even if the VP isn't ""all-in"" I'd guess that the Democrats would like to have a back-up to Hillary Clinton which isn't Bernie Sanders."
