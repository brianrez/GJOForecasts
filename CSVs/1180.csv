The last election was June 18, 2015 (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/18/denmark-election-result-too-close-to-call-as-exit-polls-suggest-no-clear-winner) which means that elections must be held before the same date of this year. Additionally, the election date would likely be set three weeks in advance (see above question). This means that the last theoretical day that it could be announced would be May 28. That gives 13 days for the ""After May 15th"" category for this to happen. As it is currently past April 1st, there is a 0% chance for that category. Lastly, we have the middle category. Unless Denmark announces their elections in the next 45 minutes, there are 35 days where the announcement could happen. There are five weekends in this time frame, so there are 25 days when this could happen on or before May 15th, and 9 days (2 weekends) for after May 15th. That being said, I believe it is also unlikely that the Danish Government would announce elections on a public holiday, and there are 4 holidays occurring on a weekday between now and the time when a date would likely need to be set (April 18, April 19, April 22, and May 17, from https://publicholidays.dk/2019-dates/). So now, there are 22 days before May 15th, and 8 days after. Simple math gives us that there are 22/30 probable days the Danish Government would announce for April 1-May 15, and 8/30 days for after May 15."

According to news journalists with inside knowledge a May 26th election is still the most likely option. An argument for this would be that Lars Løkke Rasmussen is more experienced in international and EU politics and he might want to use this to his advantage in the election campaign and in debates. Therefore having a national election close to the European might be very likely. He could still use this after the EU election so I'm increasing the probability of both the ""1st April-15th May"" option (from 50 to 60%) and the ""After May 15th"" (from 10 to 25%)."

The last 4 general elections were all announced 20-22 days before the election day (Wikipedia - only English source available). Thus, if announced before 01/04 it would be very likely the elections would take place at the end of April. Not only would Eastern (public holidays: 18/04-18/22) fall into this period, where many Danish people might be on vacation but there would be also a second campaign necessary right in the aftermath due to EU parliament elections between 23/05 - 26/5. This would challenge both financial and human resources for Rasmussen’s Venstre, and the blue block (as well for all the other parties). From Rasmussen’s perspective, who is responsible for calling out the elections (and thus can use this as a strategic tool) this double load would only make sense if he could secure its majority that way. However, its social democratic opponent Frederiksen is leading the polls at the moment, both in terms of party comparison (Venstre: 17% | Socialdemocrats 25.8%) and block comparison (blue block: 44.4% | red block: 51% (without the party Alternativet, which is also considered a red party)) (http://cphpost.dk/news/election-prospects-look-grim-for-government-in-latest-poll.html). This record low will hardly motivate Rasmussen for an early election move. It is furthermore regarded as rather unlikely by the forecast at hand that this trend will change in this short amount of time - without a drastic external shock."

Following that, it could be considered that the likelihood that in 2019 the same trend will be followed and the time frame will be similar is high. However, this year an additional factor is the EU election. Retrospectively, three times the Danish General Election occurred the same year as the EU election (1979, 1984, 1999) and none of these times, they were held together. Nevertheless, it can be explained by the distance between the elections (national general election were held in September-January while EU elections - in June). What is different, this year, considering the time, general election and EU election happen to be very close to each other. Therefore it can be expected that the decision will be made to arrange general election together with the EU (which is in May23-May26). Hence, it should be announced before the 15 of May. To be more precise, my guess is the beginning of May."

Seeing as the announcement must occur three weeks before the election day, and that one can assume that the conservative block would prefer a short campaign period (http://theconversation.com/time-to-learn-the-many-lessons-from-a-long-campaign-62048), it is my opinion that after the 15 May is not completely unlikely. As it would be favourable for the conservative block to have as short as possible campaign period, if their popularity continues to decline. However, announcing after the 15 May also seems unlikely, as this might be a too short time window for the campaign, which is why I land at 65% chance for between 1 April and 15 May 2019, as this will allow the conservative block to regain the popularity in the opinion polls, while at the same time allow for a somewhat short campaign period."

In that sense, acknowledging that the current opinion polls on the Danish government party hit particularly low figures, it is unlikely that Løkke Rasmussen will announce the elections date before the 1 April 2019. In other words, it is expected that Løkke Rasmussen will try not to precipitate the elections in the next weeks."

However, as trends poll show in institute such as Voxmeter, Megafon, Gallup and Norstat, the blue coalition does not have on average a majority of favorable voting intentions since May 2016, and the gap is growing more and more each month since this date, where since the end of October 2017 it is seen at the head of polls 6 times out of 69 studies, updated weekly.

Secondly, the last six general elections have had a campaign period of between 20-22 days (Altinget.dk). There is no reason to believe that Løkke desires a long campaigning period. In a bid to ensure high voter participation in both the European election and the Danish general election, it is likely that Løkke will hold both elections on the May 26th. A similar joining of votes occurred in 2009, when the European elections were held on the same day as the vote on the Succession Referendum. However, it is also worth noticing that a Danish general election has never been held on a Sunday and in doing so, Løkke would break with tradition (ft. dk)."
