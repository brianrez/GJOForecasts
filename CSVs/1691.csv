The consequences may well surprise him, as this would be nothing like those six bankruptcies of his various companies. If Trump were to hang tough, he may be even more surprised when more than the required 2/3 of the members of both the House and Senate vote to override his veto. One of the biggest problems of permitting Trump to push U.S. into a sovereign default and all that entails is that U.S. citizens and organizations hold the majority of these IOUs. Another -- how about a world-wide financial collapse that would beat the record of the Great Recession of 2008-2009? So, my forecast: high chances of a shutdown but Congress will gallop to the rescue before Dec. 1."

There has been recent reporting that Democrats may be trying to tie the debt ceiling vote to blocking tax cuts (https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-06-03/democrats-weigh-using-debt-ceiling-debate-to-thwart-gop-tax-cuts) and that the Freedom Caucus is looking to do the opposite with attaching spending cuts (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/01/trump-white-house-rejects-conservative-push-for-debt-ceiling-collision/?utm_term=.ae1ea6fbe5b3). However, like AHCA, I believe there will be enough political pressure for Republicans to pass the measure themselves, at least in the House. In the last 3 votes, Democrats have contributed a large number of votes in raising the ceiling (see previous WP link), and I see some chance (10%) in them taking a significant stand, but again, with political pressure, I think both parties will be forced to raise/suspend it."

1639,2017-05-12T20:21:08Z,1,[90.0],[90.0],"For the moment, the Trump administration can implement “emergency measures” to stay under the debt limit, but it won’t be too long before we get to a major crisis point because the federal government is quickly running out of cash. Already, the U.S. Treasury has less cash on hand than Apple or Google, and that cash balance is going to keep on dropping until the debt ceiling is finally lifted. The Trump administration is pushing hard to get the debt ceiling raised, and this is a complete reversal from how Donald Trump felt about the debt ceiling back in 2013. As things get tighter and tighter, the Trump administration will become increasingly desperate to get the debt ceiling raised. The key for Trump is going to be finding 218 votes in the House of Representatives that will be willing to go along with him. You would think that since Republicans control the House that this should be easy, but the truth is that there are a lot of conservative Republicans that are not inclined to agree to a debt ceiling increase without substantial accompanying budget cuts. ____________________________ COMMENTS: Republicans are supposed to be the party of fiscal responsibility. If they raise the debt ceiling and continue adding more than a trillion dollars a year to the national debt, they will lose all credibility with conservative voters on fiscal issues. But if they try to force the federal government to start living within its means that is going to severely harm the economy in the short-term."

It is relatively new rule, a blunt instrument, and fiscally stupid. The debt ceiling will get lifted, quietly, shortly after appropriations get straightened out for the rest of this fiscal year. The Ds will use the vote to point and posture -- that's the sole point of the ceiling vote rule -- but it will pass. Probably last thing before a recess or under cover of some fresh chaos from Himself."

To do so would likely ensure many of the battleground seats in Congress are won by Democrats, thus crippling the administration's ability to achieve significant policy aims."
