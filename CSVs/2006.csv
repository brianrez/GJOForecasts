For instance, he got the constitution amended in order to run for a third time in office in 2006. Although western support is slowly deteriorating, if there are any changes to be seen in Ugandan democracy, we should probably wait a little bit in the future. Corruption remains a huge problem in Africa, and this is likely to favor ruling parties (given that democratic process is not likely to be transparent and power structures have incentives to maintain the status quo). Voters' apathy will be another mitigation for change, turnout has been decreasing consistently ever since 1996 and is likely to be lower this year, again, this favors ruling parties statistically. Moreover, a poll published in late 2015 showed that 45% of Ugandans don't believe electoral process can lead to a power change. I understand that Museveni has the army on his side, which is also a major advantage. History shows that leaders such as Museveni are separated of their charge with the use of violence and not by voting."

I then used the amounted he had garnered in polls earlier last year, and then updated that calculation with the 51% of 2685 people polled in January. Adding the extra for the lack of freedom, This gave me Museveni's probability to be elected."

Neither US nor EU nor OAU are motivated to pressure and place an election monitoring team. 6. Day after Besigye arrest, under Mousevini close supervision of military. My placed 2000-3000 troops out of South Sudan where the Ugandan army had performed peace keeping operations at request of US, UN, and OAU now AU. Army commander comments "" we retired in good order:. These soldiers are well paid and trained to be Mouseveni praetorian guard. 7.Uganda and Mousevini invited US army Africa command to assist in the decades long battle against Lords. Resistance Army a cult group of terrorism as genocida as ISIS and Boko Haram. Successful counter-terrorism operation as no Lord Resistance Army attacks for over a year. 8.Even in a free election, due to elimination of a threat like LRA.a greater feeling of peace and security, the development of Uganda,s oil proven reserves place No. 3 in Africa. Economic growth at historic levels. Mousevini would poll 60 %; anyway. Note that poll is 3 months old and not Real Clear politics. 9. M is closely cooperatino with U S Africa Command in fighting AL- Shabbab and I assume he is viewed favorably in Intel community. I guess stress guess that Mouseveni is on CIA payroll like Mobutu. Given Intel superstructure assets, Ethiopia Tigrean Ruling Elite and Mousevini and army are paid supported trained by US Army best. 10.Although youth unemployment is at 75%...pattern of U S support for Soft authoritarian regimes in Ethiopia, is replicated in Uganda. Given South Sudan Sudan, Libya. Somalia, US not actively pressuring for a free election. Hear no complaints from any Governments. Or press. Will supply links from voa, and wsj later."

The next thing I did, was to look at some data from a variety of sources. I decided to approach the situation by comparing the data between now and the last Ugandan elections, in the hope that this would give me a bit of an objective comparison, however this was quite difficult in many cases. The most interesting data that I found was: Transparency International has rated Uganda's public sector as one of the most corrupt in the world. In 2014, Uganda ranked 142nd worst out of 175 and had a score of 26 on a scale from 0 (perceived as most corrupt) to 100 (perceived as clean). GDP per capita has increased from 2.6% in 2012 to 4.8% in 2014. 2/3 of the work force work in agriculture. The main export is coffee. Oil has been found but will only start being produced locally in 2017: http://www.reuters.com/article/uganda-oil-idUSL6N0NV4AW20140509. Import partners: Kenya 18.3%, UAE 14.3%, India 12.8%, China 11.3%, Japan 4.4% (2014). Export Partners: Rwanda 10.1%, UAE 9.8%, Democratic Republic of the Congo 9.3%, Kenya 9.1%, Netherlands 6%, Germany 5.7%, Italy 5.5%, China 5.3% (2014). Uganda has soldiers deployed in the northern and eastern areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in the Central African Republic, Somalia, and South Sudan. The number of internally displaced persons is estimated at 1.4 million. Population of ca 37 million Ethnic Groups: 17.4% Baganda, 9.8% Banyankole, 8.4% Basoga, 7.0% Bakiga, 6.1% Iteso, 3.2% Langi, 4.8% Acholi, 4.1% Bagisu, 4.14% Lugbara, 33.3% others. The next research I did was on the incumbent, Yoweri Museveni, the strongman of Uganda. He has been in power since 1986. Despite the fact that he is a tough leader, with a questionable human rights record, he has massively boosted the Ugandan economy and defeated most of the rebels within his country. He has good control over the military: his son leads the special forces, a great deal of the military has been trained by US forces (at least those that have been deployed to Somalia) and most political, military and judiciary leaders are affiliated with him in some way. Museveni also controls the supreme court. Although the judges are elected by parliament, the supreme court judges are all chosen by Museveni. This has a great deal of importance because it is the supreme court that decides whether an election is invalidated or not (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4882594.stm). It should be noted that election fraud is quite common, and the supreme court has ruled in almost every election year in the past that there have been irregularities, however they have not annulled any of the election results, as they have stated that the fraud did not significantly affect the outcome of the elections (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-02-20/museveni-extends-25-year-rule-in-uganda-election-opponents-reject-result). Since taking over Uganda Museveni has massively improved the quality of life of the majority of his people (excluding some minorities and political opponents). To summarize: Museveni has control of a well trained Army, regularly participates in rigging elections (and is quite good at it), intimidates oponents (http://allafrica.com/stories/201512161117.html, http://www.geeskaafrika.com/uganda-violence-looms-large-in-campaigns/13978/) and seems to be genuinely quite popular (http://www.elections.co.ug/static/afro-barometer-poll). Most importantly, the majority of people in Uganda don’t really have that much of an incentive to not vote for Museveni - he has literally pulled his country out of the ashes. This leads me to ask the question: what could happen that would cause the incumbent to lose the election? I think there are three ways that he could lose the election. The first, is that more people simply vote for one of the contenders. The second option, is that there is some kind of armed revolution that would lead to Museveni being toppled AND the elections still taking place. Finally, I think a likely possibility is that Museveni dies before the election. For one of the other candidates to be elected, it would have to mean that they have widespread support among the people that is so high, that it overcomes any election rigging, while not being so high that Museveni cancels the election. Currently, I do not think that any of the alternative candidates have the popular support required to have a significant enough impact to achieve this. Added to this, with such an ethnically divided country it would be very difficult to get widespread support in such a short time. If a candidate had this support, I think it would already be more clearly reflected in the polls and in the media. I think it is possible that another candidate may be able to mobilise the younger generations of ugandans (who now can register to vote online http://pctechmag.com/2015/08/uganda-electoral-commission-introduces-online-voter-verification-ahead-of-2016-polls/). However, I have not found any evidence that any of the candidates has an especially large or relevant grassroots movement amongst young Ugandans (and all of the front runners are part of the “old” establishment, so probably not particularly motivating to young ugandans). On the other hand, the Ugandan Electoral system is a two round system, so if Museveni gets less than 50% of the vote, he will run off against the second place candidate. This means that in theory, all voters could go against Museveni, giving the other candidate the majority of the vote. I doubt this will happen, on the one hand, because Museveni would ensure that the elections are rigged in his favour, on the other, because the incumbent would make sure to trade favours for support in a run off, and finally, I do not think Museveni will get less than 50%, based on the polls and his past support. His largest contender is Kizza Besigye, who has already lost several times in a row. The current polls do not seem to indicate that this will change. Besigye threatened violence and revolution after his last loss, however even his own party and affiliated MPs did not support him, which pushes my theory that the general sentiment of the people and politicians in Uganda is to keep making the most of the rather good status quo. The new runner in the race is Amama Mbabazi, former Prime Minister and confidant of Museveni. I think that Mbabazis chances are even lower. He does not even breach the 5% mark in the polls, and is running as an independent with no loyal party base to push him forward. Additionally, he just disbanded a large part of his electiont team: http://allafrica.com/stories/201512161307.html The second reason he could lose the election, is if there is some kind of armed revolt, but the elections still take place. I think that this is very unlikely. I’m a big fan of the greed vs. grievance model put forward by Paul Collier and Anke Hoeffler. Museveni has managed to ensure that fighting against the status quo has a very high opportunity cost. Obviously, there is the possibility that some oppressed minority or the large population of IDPs pick up arms and start a revolution. However, even if this did occur, I think it may even help Museveni, as it would give him an opportunity to show strength. Also, the timeframe and probability of a revolt taking place, for Museveni to be overthrown and the elections to still take place, is quite unrealistic in my opinion. Finally, Museveni has good relations with many of his neighbours, with the African Union, with the US and Russia (although he also has bad relations with other neighbours). I cannot identify any external players who is proactively pushing for a revolution or for Museveni to lose the election. The final reason he may lose the election, is if he dies. I think an assassination attempt is not unlikely, especially by one of his enemies (Besigye has threatened violence on numerous occasions). However, the presidential guard is extremely loyal, lead by his son and very well trained. I think if Museveni has survived the last 30 years of leadership (and, as a quick google search shows, several assassination attempts), he will be able to survive until the election. Additionally, I am sure that there will be increased security in the run up to the election. On the other hand Museveni has done publicity stunts in the past where he is extremely exposed, such as driving himself to polling stations. The other reason he may die, is simply because he is an old man. I have not found much about his health status, but at over 70 years old he is already above the average Ugandan life expectancy (not unusual, as he probably has above average doctors and access to medical care). Nonetheless, it isn't a risk that can be ignored. However, if he does die by assassination or old age, I do not think that Mbabazi or Besigye would win. Instead I think that Musevenis son, who is allegedly being groomed to take his place (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-uganda-politics-idUSBRE94J0F420130520?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews) will take his father's place on the ballot. For this to happen, Museveni would have to die soon, the election committee (I assume also controlled by Museveni's family) and Supreme Court (controlled by Museveni) would have to allow Museveni's son to take his father's place on the ballot. It is also possible, that Museveni dies, and Mbabazi comes back into the fold and takes Museveni's place as the head of the NRM, and then takes his votes. All of these events are quite unlikely, although not completely impossible. I think it is a higher possibility that in the event of Museveni's death there is a coup, the army takes control, or some type of internal power struggle occurs, causing the elections to be postponed or delayed."

He is also in good companionship with neighboring country presidents, who are sticking to their power, and ca't imagine others will do a better job. Further argumentations are the distribution of ethnic and religious %. all in all i judge the likely hood as big YM will stay in power.
