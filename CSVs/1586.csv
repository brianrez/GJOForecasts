A commitment of 450 troops [2], the presumed equivalent of what Qatar had on the border, would itself not be a challenge to China's vast army, but in this situation it would represent a considerable stretch. It was just late September that Chinese troops stationed in Djibouti had their first live-fire exercise[3] and their airfield lacks the length required for fixed-wing aircraft that would perform air-support of troops on the ground.[4] China will likely use this naval base in Djibouti for it's intended use [5] before using the base as support for ground operations and pivoting toward more tricky displays of commitment to the African region."

If either country would agree to China sending peacekeepers remains unclear (https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/dangerous-gulf-horn-how-inter-arab-crisis-fuelling-regional-tensions). Currently, neither the UNSC nor the AU Peace and Security Council seem to have scheduled deliberations about the situation in the Djibouti-Eritrea border region for this month, suggesting that the current situation is not perceived as urgent by the two bodies. Before authorizing a peace keeping mission, it also seems likely that IOs would use all other means at their hands to deescalate the situation. This would take time. And even if the situation deteriorated rapidly, given the decision-making procedures at least in the UNSC (I don't know much about the AU), a deployment of a peacekeeping mission by the end of the year seems highly unlikely."

854,2017-09-18T23:35:02Z,1,[18.0],[18.0],"This is a very rough forecast, because there is a lot of information that is hard to get. China offered to deploy troops in July on three conditions: 1. A request from the AU; 2. Agreement from both parties; 3. UN authorization. I haven't seen anything public from the AU, so I think the request from the AU is probably being debated behind closed doors. This may be a topic of discussion in the margins of the UNGA, among African and non-African nations, and in the absence of any specific information on the discussion I estimate a 25% chance that the AU will request China's involvement soon after the end of the UNGA, with a 50% chance that it will be followed by UN authorization and agreement by Djibouti and Eritrea by the end of the year. That makes a 12.5% chance overall. I add to that a 5% chance that violence will break out on the border and the decision will be expedited. Rounding off, that makes 18%. If no request comes from the AU by the end of September, I'll drop that to 5%."

8205,2017-09-14T20:14:38Z,1,[92.0],[92.0],"The South China Morning Post reported the following: China opened its first overseas naval base in Djibouti in August 2017. China has presented the facility as a support base to run anti-piracy operations in waters along Africa’s east coast as well as peacekeeping and humanitarian missions in the region. China's state news agency Xinhua did not disclose how many military personnel would be stationed at the facility or when it would become fully operational. But previous mainland reports have put the size of the deployment at 10,000. The lease runs for a decade with China paying US$20 million a year. But given it sits at the shipping choke point of the Gulf of Aden which opens to the Suez Canal and beyond, China’s regional neighbors including Japan, India and Vietnam were likely to view the deployment with alarm, mainland experts said. Djibouti already hosts several foreign military bases, including one each from the US and Japan, two strategic rivals to Beijing. A base by Saudi Arabia is also under construction in Djibouti. My thinking is based on the report that at least 10,000 Chinese troops will be sent to support the new naval base compared to the 4,000 U. S. troops at its base. Sending in even more Chinese troops would fit into President Xi Jinping's expansion desires plus give China better control of the Bab al-Mandab Strait. From China's perspective, It makes sense to have more troops there. At this point, China needs to influence the two countries in conflict and the African Union, who has sent in an investigative body and the UN. The only body that needs to be courted somewhat is Eritrea, which seems very doable."
