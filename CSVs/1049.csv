The protestors have decreased since the Bouteflika resignation, however, they keep taking the streets every week, and they show themselves committed with a real change, and against the 12 December elections. So, i assign a 20% chance of the election being cancelled due to the protests. This would be higher if in the next weeks we see an increase of violence, but for the moment the protestors have been pacific. -Logistic problems. The last elections were scheduled in july, but they were cancelled because no candidate was presented (although it is said that the real reason was the lack of logistic capability to organise the election). This time, however, the army chief Gaid Salah has been very clear about his intention to hold the election, and the Algerian Press Service has announced 137 candidate petitions so i think there is no more than a 5% chance. -Elite breakdown. The political elite in Algeria is not completely united. Although Gaid Salah is the visible face, there is some factions that are not very happy to hold the election. However, they know now is not the best moment to start a conflict between themselves, so i think there is a 3% chance for the internal power struggle to happen."
