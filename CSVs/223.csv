The forecasters are split between toss-up and lean Democrat in this R+1 district, but 538 favors Kildee (D) over Junge (R) by an almost 4-1 margin. At a superficial glance Kildee would appear to be in trouble, given that it's a midterm and the national tide seems to be turning in favor of the Republicans. However, Kildee is an established politician with a local brand name and no glaring liabilities that I'm aware of. I expect that Republicans across the board will continue to either close the gap or extend their leads up to election night, but I also think that Kildee is relatively safe. Emphasis on relatively."
