Indeed, to keep public budgets stable, the Russian government is forced to raise taxes and extend the retirement age in the years to come. As long as the standard of living was rising, the vast majority of Russian refrained from active participation in politics. But then from 2014 to 2018, real incomes fell for five years running. Kremlin could now be facing a crisis of legitimacy – and that in a phase of uncertainty about a possible shift of power after Putin’s last term of office (2018–2024). Putin has said he wants to raise living standards and improve social care in Russia, and a cut to military spending is one way to make funds available for such projects this. Further, the reform proposed by the former Minister of Finance Alexei Kudrin recommends increasing spending on infrastructure, education, and health care, and decreasing spending on defense, security, and a number of subsidies. Against this backdrop, Kremlin will less likely reduce its defense budget since the Russian arms industry employs around two million workers, whose support for the Kremlin regime is essential. Also, cutting the defense budget contradicts the Kremlin’s current political priorities by glorifying the success of the military buildup. As it concerns Syria and Ukraine: According to estimates, the direct costs of Russian military operations in Syria and Ukraine make up just a few percents of the Russian defense budget, which amounted to around €43.3 billion in 2017. The necessary expenditures could thus be covered entirely through reallocations, for instance from the budget for military exercises, without any added burden on the budget. Again, it is less likely that Kremlin will cut DB or even less likely that it will increase DB beyond 4.4%. Probably it will remain the same or bwn 4.0 and 4.2%"

The percentage decreased by 23% between 2016 and 2017 and by 5% between 2017 and 2018. This shows two trends: first, military spending is rarely above 4.4% of GDP and it has been decreasing since 2016. Russian military spending has only been equal or above 4.4% of GDP four times in that time period and the spending drop between 2016 and 2017 is the largest since the period between 1997 and 1998, when military spending as a percentage of GDP decreased by 32.5%. The largest increases were 25.8% between 2008 and 2009, 19.5% between 2014 and 2015, and 14.8% between 1998 and 1999 while the majority of increases were between 2 and 9% of GDP. An increase to 4.4% of GDP from the current level of 3.9% would be an overall increase of 12.8, which has not happened during this time period: the closest was that 14.8% increase between 1998 and 1999.

Russian military spending, both in Rouble and GDP %, was increasing since Putin took back the Russian presidency in 2012 but, as the effects of both economic sanctions and the downturn of the Russian economic in 2014, has decreased since 2017.

Russia faces serious domestic economic concerns (i.e. degraded infrastructure, over reliance on energy exports, rising poverty) that will curb its ability to devote more resources to its military. This, however, does not necessarily suggest the long term degradation of Russia military power. Russia's military relies on conscripts, which means that outside of the money needed to provide initial training, it does not necessarily need to devote as much money to funding year round readiness, or invest as heavily in training like its Western competitors with more professional armed services. Instead, it devotes more of its defense budget to R&D, procurement, and modernization. While all of these initiatives have significant up front expenses, their true costs can be spread out over a longer time horizon. This helps Russia keep its military spending low. Finally, Russia is undoubtedly itching to find a way to withdraw its military forces from Syria. Although the intervention has been hugely successful for Putin, and it has considerably raised his domestic and international standing, he knows that once events ""go South"" (i.e. Russian death toll increases in country) these gains will erode. Therefore, Putin will most likely seek a way to extricate Russia/himself from a hard military presence in Syria, thereby further decreasing Russian military spending in 2019."

First, what I found was that 2016 was an outlier year. It was the only percentage to break 5% in this period. Second, the upper limit was 4.9% (excluding the 2016, the outlier, of course) with a lower limit of 3.0%. The median was 3.9%, while the mean was 4.0%, and the upper quartile was 4.3%, which goes to show how typically low the budget is. In all fairness, it is important to note that from 2014 to 2017 (the most recent data available) the expenditure percentage was higher than the mean, but only 2015 and 2016 broke even a 4.4% expenditure. As a result of all of this, I am very doubtful of another outlier year, and expect 2019 to be less than 4.9%. Given that the budget has only broken 4.4% five times in the 26 years we have data for, I am going with 75% ""less than 4.4%"" and 25% ""4.4% to 4.9%"", which is percentage that Russia has exceeded 4.4% in the past, plus a 5% bump due to ongoing conflicts that Russia is involved in."

However, domestic turmoil is more likely to reduce (or maintain) Russia's overall expenditure from 2017's level of 4.3%.

Second, the dollar (or ruble) amount of spending should really be seen as a real life set of assets and people being mobilized. Defense % of GDP is not a dial to turn based on geopolitical events. The amount of spending is not very easy to change. Thus, I used the average of the last three years as a base rate (Putin would have been of a different mind before 2015). It quickly showed that 2016 was an abnormal year. So I ignored 2016 and assumed the previous year ruble amount (not % GDP) plus some growth on the 2017 ruble GDP, using the latest assumed GDP growth rate of 1.9% (August)."

I'd expected a drop back in my original forecast, although this is just under my preferred bucket at the moment. Consider it possible that the current increase in oil revenues could encourage some extra spending above this rate, SIPRI themselves note that oil exporters have cut generally in 2017 - so I'm not over-reacting and sticking with the 4.4 - 4.9 bucket mainly - also Kremlin plan was reported to be to drop and then ease back into the milex budget towards 2020. I also note upwards revisions for 2016 which could happen again, however feel even more so now that expenditure much over 5% is not sustainable in the long term. Doesn't necessarily mean that 2019 won't be another exceptional year, so keeping something in the higher buckets, just in case I need to make later revisions. Need to do more consideration of possible GDP growth."

These are absolutely bizarre figures that cannot withstand any comparison with the secret parts of budgets in developed economies. At the same time, a significant proportion of the “secret expenses” most likely does not go to military purposes but simply remains in someone’s pocket. In contrast, military spending rose from 2 trillion, 141 billion in 2013 to 3.775 trillion in 2016. In 2017 it fell to 2.778 trillion, and it will decline further in 2018 to 2.771 trillion, but will grow again afterward, to 2.808 trillion in 2020. It should be borne in mind that the actual military spending in Russia is much higher than the planned figures. Traditionally, additional budget revenues, if any, are allocated to this sector. Moreover, some military expenditures are concealed under other civilian items, primarily under the “national economy.” Police spending rose from 1 trillion, 487 billion in 2013 to 1.898 trillion in 2016, 1.977 trillion in 2017, 2.108 trillion in 2018, and 2.140 trillion in 2020.
