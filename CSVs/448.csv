I assume the IC would change their assessment at that point, though there may be lag time of a few weeks to verify and disseminate the information.

But a large portion of US voters dislike or even hate brown skinned Muslims, so this isn't bothering them. The downsides of publicly stating that a Chinese lab accident is more probable than not are: (1) Asian Americans already are being increasingly targeted by hate groups on account of the pandemic. This would make it much worse. Indeed, some might be tortured and killed and their businesses damaged on account of such an announcement. These people also vote. (2) This would harm US/China relations without providing any benefit. If the US is serious about pressuring China to ease up on the Uighurs or behave better in the South China Sea, Biden’s foreign policy advisors probably are begging him to prevent any such announcement.

Dr.Bloom the researcher in Seattle and many others are continuing to trace the genetic origins of the virus. I am increasing to 3 percent because it appears plausible that this genetic detective work may find the most probable source stored somewhere on a cloud database. I am personally convinced that the Wuhan lab through some gain of function research or exposure of personnel to bat corona virus in situ. The fact that PRC ordered the early Sequences deleted and required all research papers approved before release supports an inference that a lab accident is the source. But it would be a real stretch to state this hypothesis is more or less probable. Seen enough to strongly support imposition of rigorous safety protocols for this type of research in US .

The Chinese have not shown any willingness to assist or comply with any investigation having the (unexpected?) bonus of supplying the third world with their vaccine and the associated soft power and gratitude of the poorer countries. From a human and pragmatic perspective, the BBC reports that due to the high death toll of 3.5 million, it is important to ascertain the origin of the virus to avoid such disasters that might involve how scientific studies are carried out or the study animals from the wild and the processes there.

99943,2021-06-12T03:09:46Z,1,[2.0],[2.0],"First of all, what is a ""laboratory accident""? So many people conflate ""laboratory accident"" with genetic engineering. The virus could have been released as a result of research activities at any point from sample collection to actual research to waste disposal. If a research worker in the field got Covid by walking into a bat cave to collect bats with insufficient PPE, or when obtaining virus samples from bats outside a bat cave with insufficient PPE or precautions, would either of those be a laboratory accident? Zoonoses and research accidents are not mutually exclusive events, and the concept of ""laboratory accident"" is vague and poorly defined and is used by very many people to mean many different things. But suppose we say that a laboratory accident means that a sample of the virus was in a laboratory and was released from that laboratory by accident, regardless of whether it was being stored or studied intentionally or whether its presence was incidental to some other work. How would we know whether the virus was released as a result of an accident? We'd know it was released in a lab accident if 1) someone finds a sample of it in a freezer, or 2) the intelligence community finds communications or data showing that someone had it in their freezer (and the only way they'd know that is if they had sequenced it). (Many early sequences were not released publicly, and many early patient samples were ordered destroyed; China was and is not eager to explore this possibility.) A variety of other information would offer supporting evidence, such as if any lab personnel had positive antibody test results very early on (supposedly they didn't, but those tests aren't perfect). There is no ""smoking gun"" signature of genetic engineering. Furin cleavage sites occur naturally. Moreover, if gain-of-function work was occurring, it would have been done at at least BSL3 if not BSL4, and I would expect that they would know what they are doing. Researchers who work at BSL3 and BSL4 are serious about what they do; accidents do happen but are uncommon. I think the most likely lab accident scenario would be from work characterizing bat coronavirus samples at BSL2, ironically most likely with the goal of understanding and mitigating their pandemic potential. It is also more plausible that BSL2 work could have been done sloppily or that there could have been a mistake. It would be much easier for a high-risk pathogen (that should be handled at BSL4) to escape BSL2 than BSL3 or BSL4. And we know that thousands of bat coronavirus samples were being studied at BSL2 at 2 institutes in Wuhan."
