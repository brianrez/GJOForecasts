I am very skeptical that any forecasting by Japanese new sources offer a realistic forecast. I also am skeptical of the fact that over half of Japanese are undecided. Despite an uptick in popularity of Abe due to his response to the North Korean missile launches, I don't think that North Korea could launch enough missiles to mitigate the damage of his scandal laden administration and recent Regional elections. More accurate indications of a potential loss of seats for the LDP would be the recent bellwether election in Tokyo which saw an historic loss for the scandalized leader, Abe, of the LDP losing in an historic defeat to Koike her allies and her Tomin First no Kai regional party. This does not bode well for the LDP as Keiko formed a national party, Kibo no To, drawing from the DP, LDP and gaining support from Komeito. Ideologically Keiko is just as terrifying as Abe and embraces the Japanese nationalism of Nippon Kaigi that has allowed the LDP to become popular and form a governing coalition. Additionally Keiko was a former minister of Defense of the fourth most power military in the world (yes, Japan) supports amending the constitution to support (I gotta say the f word) fascism and wants to turn Tokyo into Anime Land! She's got it all."
