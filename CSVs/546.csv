Looking at the one month trajectory from 1 Feb until now, Dogecoin is clearly in a downward trajectory that is unlikely to reverse unless something significant intervenes. Will continue to monitor for activity, however it is highly unlikely Dogecoin will end higher in March than its spike in February.

Due to the lack of popular momentum, I suspect that Dogecoin will continue to plummet in value and will most likely not reach its former height of price as seen on February 15th."
