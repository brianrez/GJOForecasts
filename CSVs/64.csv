Tinubu is a seasoned politician, has a lot of money and boasts a vast patronage network. This combined with his party's control over the levers of government should help him eke out a win. I'm not willing to give him more than a 55% chance though because he does not appear to have the full support of the president (whom it is said engineered the currency situation to frustrate him) and new technology would make rigging more difficult. Furthermore, he faces persistent questions about his health and source of wealth.

Nevertheless, it is important to take into account the fact that Obi has garnered a significant amount of the young vote. However, only 34% of voters voted in the 2019 election, and this was likely older members of the community, who currently favor Tinubu.

While there are three candidates in the running, I believe the true race is between the All Progressives Congress candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and the surprise candidate (from the Labour Party), Peter Obi. Tinubu is currently backed by several large powers in Nigeria, including a multimillionaire former governor of Lagos, and claims to have brought the current APC leader, Muhammadu Buhari to power. Obi is a surprising candidate in the running who has garnered the support of many young voters, which I think will put him at a significant advantage as technology will be used to ensure voter identity and send election results. Finally, the Peoples Democratic Party candidate, Atiku Abubaker, has run for the presidency five times since 1993 and the 2023 election will be his last shot, but there is little data that it will be a promising one. I think a major influence in this election will be the incumbent's support for the APC, but it's possible that Nigerians believe they are in need of a leadership change with over 60 percent of people live in poverty and the country faces security crises daily. These statistics are something Mr. Obi has been keen to point out during his campaign."

Increased fractionalization in the APC party a week before the elections will impact Tinubu's chances as support for Obi will increase.
