President Donald Trump has also stated that the treaty should by renegotiated to include China since they have risen to become a major economic, political, and military power. This is not the first time that the United States has accused Russia of being in violation of the treaty and Russian officials are under the impression that they are remaining compliant with the accord. Since the United States wants to include China in a ""future"" treaty I find it highly unlikely that all parties will be in agreement and there will not be discussions held prior to 1 October 2019. However, there is a small possibility that there can be formal discussions to address the issue."

While both sides have expressed interest in reopening negotiations, there has not been any tangible evidence to suggest the scales are tipping in that direction. Instead, over the last month, both countries have continued to test previously banned weapons. Consider the Russian's Skyfall, Poseidon, Dagger, Avengard and the United States' ""Low Yield"" tactical warheads (https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ne8nkw/all-the-absurd-new-weapons-russia-is-building-in-the-new-nuclear-arms-race)"

If this was something that was close to being formally started, it would likely have already been talked about in the news. The second reason I say that there is a 0% chance of this happening before October 1 is because of egos. Both Putin and Trump are the most egotistical world leaders I've ever heard of. Regardless of what they say, neither of them wants to give up any of their power or percieved power so the idea of getting either of them to the table to talk about controlling nuclear arms is a little far fetched."

67423,2019-06-13T19:12:11Z,6,[5.0],[-5.0],"Update: Last week, at an economic forum in St. Petersburg, Putin commented on the lack of development in the START negotiations. Arguing that Russia has been pushing for the nuclear arms treaty talks to begin, the US, in contrast, have been stalling and made no moves to move negotiations along. Consequently, Putin said that Russia will just not extent the treaty, if the US is not interested in beginning talks. Putin speaking so bluntly on the topic seems to underline Russia's dwindling desire to pursue these negotiations. In combination with recent remarks on Russia's arms production abilities, Putin seems to be emphasizing Russia's position as a leading military power and as such, a country that does not need treaties. Just around the same time, leading democrats send a letter to Trump urging him to engage with negotiations and seek an extension on the START treaty, as they feared the potential consequences of a lack of treaty. Trump has not responded this query, and does not seem interested in prioritizing this issue. This current situation seems a long way away from any formal negotiations to commence, and I adjust my forecast accordingly.

67625,2019-06-09T10:14:16Z,3,[5.0],[-35.0],"Update (9/06/19) In my frst forecast, I adopted a rational approach to the possibilities US and Russia have in the renewal/non renewal of an arms control treaty. In this update I decided to drastically change my approach as well as my forecast, considering mainly two articles I recently happened to read (https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/04/25/nuclear-security-arms-control-and-the-us-russia-relationship/ and https://www.rferl.org/a/putin-says-russia-prepared-to-drop-arms-control-treaty-if-u-s-not-interested-in-renewal/29984790.html). First of all, looking at the history of the arms control treaty between the two superpowers, it is noticeable how the first efforts generally begun from the US part, followed by a Russian side showing less interest in drafting a treaty to enhance their bargaining power. Apparently with the Trump administration, which will most likely still stand in October, thearm control barganining changed: the US are showing less interest in re-arranging the situation, even if facing the incoming end of the New START. Putin obviously can't show weakness, instead he has to show diplomatic muscles by saying that Russian security can be assured even without an arm control treaty. At this point it is not very likely that Trump and Putin will show signs of backstepping from their positions - thsi consideration relies purely from the consideration of the leaders' personality and constructed role in international politics. Moreover, ""U.S. and Russian officials in the past have held strategic stability talks to take a broad look at developments that affect their strategic relationship. Such talks are useful, particularly when new developments, such as those in the cyber and space domains, emerge and when Russian nuclear doctrine has provoked concern in Washington and led to changes in the U.S. nuclear posture. Even if strategic stability talks do not spin off specific negotiations, they provide a venue for the sides to exchange views and better understand the concerns of the other. During the Trump administration, a one-day session of strategic stability talks took place in September 2017. As of March 2019, it has not agreed to a second meeting"". If a new treaty or the extension of the New Start will happen, it will probably happen with the new US administration. In a few months I will know if my previous approach would have been more accurate than this new one. I think this one relies more on the diplomatic history in arms control between US and Russia, but the psychological and contextual variables can be unpredictable."
67429,2019-06-08T12:26:11Z,6,[3.0],[0.0],"Update: President Putin has said Russia is prepared to drop a nuclear treaty with the United States. He accused Washington of showing little genuine interest in commencing negotiations to extent the New START treaty. With no negotiation process having been arranged, and an apparent willingness by both parties to 'ignore' it, the likelihood of negotiations beginning within the next four months seems low. The forecast remains the same."

USA wants to have the option to dislocate nuclear weapons in space to counter Russian hypersonic weapons, at least till the US will have developed similar systems Russia did.

The result will be, that rather sooner then later we will have nucler armed satelites hoving over our heads."

Russia claims it still supports the prospect of new negotiations, however, it is not in favor of US’ plan to extend these negotiations, and the subsequent treaty, to include China. Yet, tri-lateral negotiations seem to be the desired way forward for the Trump administration. This seriously compromises any hope of a new negotiations to initiate in just 4 months, because as of now, neither Russia nor China is interested in the prospect of this configuration for the deal. China has significantly fewer of the warheads in question than US and Russia. Moreover, Russia has expressed their wish for any negotiations to center solely around a bilateral agreement between themselves and the US. Hence, as of now, it seems increasingly unlikely that formal negotiations should commence before October 1st. Consequently, I adjust my probability to 10 %."

According to Executive Director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association Daryl Kimball, this is an important first step. During a press conference in relation to the visit Pompeo stated that the two states will continue their discussion on New START, which makes me believe that formal talks about a new nuclear arms control treaty or an extension/modification of the existing nuclear arms control treaty could begin before 1 October 2019. However, with that being said, October is still far away, and the situation could drastically change before then. It is also evident that the relationship is still strained, and that the two states disagree on many subjects, therefore the formal talks could not occur before 1. October, or not happen at all. Therefore 60% chance of it occurring.

There is a small chance of this all being upended though by events outside the influence of both countries so i have allowed a small percentage probability for extension/modification of the existing treaty."

I think Trump wants to be able to negotiate with Putin but Putin just wants power over the US, and Trump's willingness to try and work a deal may be seen as weakness. Putin needs to assert his skill and finesse as a leader and establish dominance to stay in power beyond term limits. If he does go into formal negotiations it will just be a chess move."

Trump has a tendency to pull out of Obama negotiated deals but is never eager to renegotiate them, i.e. the Iran Nuclear deal and Paris Climate accords. Furthermore, these negotiations require a fair bit of political maneuvering and intent signaling before formal negotiations begin. As of now there has been none of this. Pulling out of the INF could've been a way to increase pressure to bring Russia to the table and increase the US's bargaining position. However, neither side yet to show a willingness to renegotiate. Also I find it more than likely that Trump would prefer to let Obama's START deal lapse, rather than extend it, based on his previous handling of Obama deals and his criticism of START. If both side are keen to negotiate a new Nuclear deal then I predict it'll take more time for them to cool off over pulling out of the INF and then there will have to be months of maneuvering and signaling before talks can be made on when and where negotiation could happen. I find this to be a process that'll take longer than 6 months and therefore find it unlikely, but not impossible that formal nuclear negotiations could begin before October 1st 2019."

Ironically, he is far more concerned about countries with far less developed nuclear programs (N.Korea and Iran), though it is also driven by other outlying factors, more than just nuclear research alone. His propensity to gush over the Russian leader as well as his business ties to this nation basically guarantees an amicable relationship with the Russian heads of state. This underscores his lack of focus when it comes to Russia's constant violation of the previous Nuclear Treaty which was suspended recently. It could also be that his adoration of the American Army's capabilities (because being American means loving America's guns) is a sign that he may even welcome this deployment of research for nuclear development. Beyond him however, the two countries are involved in a bunch of proxy wars which could potentially slide into dire situations that potentially exposes them to necessitate talks to prevent use of nuclear warfare, because that possibility will always exist, hence the 3%. However, it's more likely that the two nations might become embroiled in a new age nuclear arms race, joined possibly by a third nation, China. This scenario will definitely result in some form of nuclear arm control treaty though very doubtful that it would occur before Oct. 1, 2019."

66755,2019-04-03T02:31:30Z,1,[50.0],[50.0],"There are currently 12 agreements, as of February 1st, that the Trump administration has in some way altered by either renegotiating or pulling out https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/01/politics/nuclear-treaty-trump/index.html. Of these, 6 are treaties or broader multinational agreements (KORUS, INF, NAFTA, JCPOA, TPP, Paris), and of those, 3 are either in the process of being renegotiated (NAFTA, KORUS) or an offer of renegotiation has been put on the table with the threat of pulling out (INF). Making a judgement based on multiple examples, the President by way of tweeting and otherwise likes to take credit for things or upend a process/agreement just to renegotiate and claim credit (Devos and Special Olympics, Government Shutdown). Since the Administration is pulling out of INF if the Russians do not come to the table, I leave a large chance that the President is willing to renegotiate on terms his administration feels are the most advantageous, and the Russians (https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/12/27/is-there-a-glimmer-of-hope-for-the-inf-treaty/) have shown support of continuing the treaty."
67428,2019-04-02T16:47:53Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"- There will be an extension/a new treaty I think that is very likely that Russia and the US will implement a new treaty or will introduce some modifications to the text because both of them they have recently increased their military capacity and updated their technologies. To be more clear, I compare the current New START to the previous one, the START treaty negotiated in the ‘80s. At that time the tensions between the two superpowers was higher than today, and so was the fear of the capabilities and intentions of the other: that treaty reflected the suspicion and the uncertainty of those years, including strict limits on nuclear proliferation. Instead, the New START has been stipulated in 2009 and “does not contain layers of limits and sublimits; each side can determine its own mix of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and heavy bombers.”. It doesn’t forbid the states to modernize strategic nuclear forces, even if the goal of predictability and transparency of their intention is still present. This fact has allowed Russia and US to develop their offensive nuclear technologies, so will be necessary to modernize the treaty too. I would also add that Russia is currently in a bad economic situation, and I can’t imagine as a brilliant idea from Putin put himself in the position of raising the military expenditure in absence of an agreement with the US: this would mean more taxes and more dissatisfaction among the population. Another reason, is the necessity of an agreement between the two powerful state about army proliferation. Indeed, after reciprocal accusations about not respecting the INF, both the State withdraw from it. So, now it is fundamental keeping at least another agreement alive and concrete, both to avoid the risk of proliferation and to not damage even more the historically troubled relations between Russia and US. In addition, a renovation of this treaty would be an occasion to contrast the rise of China: indeed it has established a cooperation with European countries and is investing an impressive flow of money in infrastructure to control the markets in a not so far future (ex. The construction of BRI). In front of such a plan and because of the recent trade war that Trump has engaged with China, the US have better to keep Russia on its side at least in this field. In addition, I argue that China is also developing its nuclear arms, which could be interpreted in two ways: as the reason why continuing having bilateral agreement between Russia and US is useless, because other big countries instead are becoming more aggressive, or as the reason why is necessary at least maintaining the order and pursuing cooperation, also signing bilateral agreements like this or even include the “enemy” (China) in order to control it."

Due to the high degree of uncertainty in terms of the current US administration’s international policies, and the discrepancy to former US government’s policies, the forecast excludes the time prior Trump’s election- even though there were already withdrawals prior, such as the US withdrawal from the Treaty on the Limitation of Missile Defence Systems (ABM Treaty). Following withdrawals were detected: On January 23, 2017, Trump signed an executive order to renegotiate NAFTA, with the intention of obtaining a more favorable deal for American workers. Eventually, Canada, Mexico and the US agreed upon on replacing NAFTA with the USMCA treaty on September 30, 2017 after formal renegotiations (http://www.wongfleming.com/trump-updates-2018-trumps-treatment-of-international-treaties-immigrants-and-refugees/). On January 23, 2017, Trump withdrew the US from the TPP Agreement, promoting closer economic cooperation between the signing states, without formal re-negotiations (Ibid.). On January 23, 2017, Trump formally abandoned the TTIP negations for a free transatlantic economic zone and declared an “end to the era of multinational trade agreements.” (Ibid.) In August 2017, Trump announced that the US would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement with the possibility of rejoining “if the terms improved for the United States.” Two formal negotiation sessions have taken place since then but only pro forma since the US cannot withdraw officially before three years after the agreement entered into force (Ibid.). On October 12, 2017, the US notified the UN's culture and education body, UNESCO of their. decision to withdraw from the organization and to seek to establish a permanent observer mission to UNESCO instead. The United States has walked out of UNESCO once before under ex-president Ronald Reagan, who quit in 1984 over alleged financial mismanagement and claims of anti-US bias in some of its policies (https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/10/274748.htm). On May 8, 2018 the US administration officially withdrew from the JCPOA Deal that in a nutshell aimed to block Iran from building nuclear weapons in exchange for the abolishment off a variety of sanctions. No formal re-negotiations have taken place since then. Instead, the US administration pressures its western partners and companies to abolish Iran-related business (https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2018/05/281938.htm). On June 19, 2018 the US left the UN Human Rights Council, “an organization that is not worthy of its name.” No formal re-negotiations have taken place since then (https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2018/06/283341.htm) . This record of withdrawals from international treaties and organizations since 2017 stresses the attitude of the current US administration towards these regimes. Only in one out of the 7 cases (14%), real negotiations have taken place - considered the fact that those in the context of the Paris Climate Accord were just formal procedure. Particular meaningful for the question to be answered is the US’ withdrawal from the JCPOA and the US’ efforts to undermine other states’ efforts to uphold it without the US."

James Acton, from the Carnegie Nuclear Policy Program, has said: ‘Russia, I think, would agree to extending New START even if the US withdraws from INF. The problem is that it’s increasingly clear that this administration doesn’t want to extend New START’ (Mehta, Defence News 23 Oct 2018)."

Putin has declared that Russia will not take the initiative for further negotiations on disarmament in response to the US move of withdrawing first. Moreover, since the allegations against Russia are supported by the NATO State members e.g France, I believe that this strengthens the reasons for Putin not to engage the discussion (first) of any time soon. Hence, if Pompeo declared that Washington was open for further negotiations with Moscow, I believe that the ball is in Trump’s administration’s court. I find highly unlikely that we will witness a new arm race in the following months. Instead, I find very likely that Trump will engage in new negotiations, but when? Trump made a point of honour that during his presidency, he will be the man who succeeded in bringing Washington and Moscow closer together, and in particular on the crucial question of nuclear power. Thus, despite the dissent and strategic benefits (from a realistic point of view in IR) of the current situation — e.g deterrence towards China — I find most likely that Trump will seek to re-discuss with Moscow. However, we could expect Trump’s administration to leave the 6 months of withdrawal for Moscow to change rifle of shoulder and convince Washington of its goodwill. In that sense, I believe that what will happen in the following months will determine the future perspectives on the New START treaty. Nevertheless, considering Trump’s doctrine (opposing Obama's works), it is very probable that Trump is seeking to create a new treaty with Moscow and — from a strategic point of view — we could expect such move to occur closer to 2020 if Trump wants to present for presidency again."

B) In the event that US and Russia decide to sign a new deal for nuclear arms control, they could 3: open formal negotiations before the 1 October 2019 4: open formal negotiations in the proximity of the New Start deadline (after 1 October 2019).

Here it is requested to assign a probability to the event 2 and 3 considered together: while 2 is not much likely, 3 is actually probable. Now the question becomes which one between A) and B) is more probable. Given the recent developments, I would say that a new deal (B) is slightly more probable than the maintainment of the New START - even if drawing a new deal in such delicate issue is not a lighl decision to do.

Given the actual deadline 0f 2021, I’m going to guess that formal negotiations would more likely start in 2020 because starting too early allows the negotiations to drag on."

The U.S. President, however, has repeatedly noted that he wants to increase U.S.-Russian relations, and negotiations over the treaty would be a catalyst to achieving that agenda. With elections in 2020, President Trump should be considering what foreign policies will make voters like him more, and working on a nuclear arms treaty would be to his advantage. It is unlikely, however, because both parties have accused the other of breaking the treaty on a number of occasions, which has lead to a distrust in each other as well as the efficacy of treaties and negotiations, and both presidents have a history of preferring hard power over signing a treaty."

This even stringent NEW TREATY set aggregate limits on the numbers of deployed ICBM to seven hundred, slashed the number of nuclear warheads on deployed ICBMs to 1550, and halve the combining number of launchers and heavy bombers allowed to eight hundred."

It's hard to say what Trump has or hasn't agreed on, but it does seem possible that even with general disapproval, skepticism, or criticism from the people who actually have to ratify any treat negotiated or signed by President Trump's team, a formal negotiation may very easily be started. Given the timeline, I'm willing to keep it higher than 0-2%, but especially since Trump's ADHD method of political focus tends to shift quickly when he's bored or unhappy, and this seems to be something that would be good strategically for Russia (negotiate a treaty they haven't been following and don't plan to follow, but which the US will dither over violating as it would justify a bigger public reaction from Russia if the US did violate it even in any reasonable way), and I wouldn't put it above Putin to suggest opening negotiations, nor would I expect Trump to ignore Putin or respond negatively if Putin did reachd out. By itself, I don't think it's the kind of thing Trump would lay plans for or care much about without prompting; it doesn't have any particular popular support nor connect to any prestige associations Trump would otherwise value, and it seems that pretty much no one with any power or sensibility thinks it would be useful to continue: the military is moving away already because they have to plan for the actual future that's presenting itself, and the attitude here and abroad is very much shaping up to building arsenals and strengthening world partners or partisans (except the US and Europe, it seems)."

However, President Trump has shown himself to be much more likely to be less concerned and more lenient toward Russian than the average American or US politician. So I suppose it's possible.
