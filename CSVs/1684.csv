At that time, the State Dept.'s spokeswoman said the administration would start to resume a push for the UN Security Council to impose a global arms ban against South Sudan. Less than a month ago, the UN Security Council adopted a US-drafted resolution that didn't impose an arms embargo but, “expresses its intention to consider all measures, including an arms embargo, as appropriate, to deprive the parties of the means to continue fighting and to prevent violations” of the December cease-fire agreement. Given recent development, as well as horrific media reports that have gotten attention recently that 40 officials may be individually responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity in South Sudan, I predict a 65% chance of a global arms embargo on South Sudan by October 1st."

International support would be more difficult in a situation of armed conflict, and there should not be much interest to add another armed crisis to the international political situation. Therefore I believe there will be international interest in an arms embargo. Currently the US are promoting an arms embargo but could not yet get the necessary majority, with eight abstentions in a December vote (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4444798/US-pushes-UN-consider-arms-embargo-South-Sudan.html). It appears that resistance was posed by Russia, China, Japan and Egypt, and though I can immagine the Russian and Chinese interest, and possibly those of Egypt, I do not see why Japan should not favor an embargo. The timeframe to October should be sufficiently large even for a slow moving giant like the UN to come to a resolution. Overall I thus believe there is good reason but no certainty. A 60% thus would be a good guess. However, I do would like to be in the top of the scoring for a question at least once! And on a black or white question like this one there is no chance to get there with a well argumented good and realistic percentage but only by a yes or no answer: therefore I put a 100%, against my better knowledge (with the hope to give the masterminds of how to measure forecasting capacities with the brier score does still have a significant weakness when applied to yes or no questions)."
