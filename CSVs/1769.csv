However, the Falcons have demonstrated an ability to succeed on offense - in the 2016 regular season their average points per game was 33.8 compared to the Patriots who only put up 27.6. This is not the only factor that wins games - defense is an important part. In this aspect, the Patriots far surpassed the Falcons (15.6 ppg let up to 25.4 respectively). This, no doubt, let the Patriots record be one of the best in the league, 14-2. Compare this to the Falcons' record of 11-5 and the importance of a good defense cannot be understated. Going into the Superbowl, the ability to shut down the opposing offense is going to be of utmost importance for both teams, and the Patriots have the edge here. Experience must be factored into this as well; the duo of Tom Brady and Bill Belichick have won four Super Bowls together. The largest detractor for the Patriots is the loss of their number one TE, Robert Gronkowski who averaged 16.3 yards per game, 4.5 receptions per game and 0.7 touchdowns per game in the 2015 season. This may hurt the Patriots, which is why I have opted to have the odds as close as they are."
