Gallup Pakistan prediction/polling was positive for PML-N in 2013 election (their predictions were right). In election 2013 PML-N had not 6 seats for majority with 32.77% (they had 166 seats), but now they have 38%. It has enhanced by 5% - approximately 8 potential seats, and there may be majority. 2) Pakistan people will elect candidates from PML-N, but they will not elect Nawaz Sharif 3) Nawaz Sharif scandal was in 2017, but opinion of Pakistan people about him is not very bad now. Nawaz had falls and rises before - 1993, 2008, 2013. In several sources it said that it was unfair about corruption scandal with Nawaz. 4) Wife’s memoirs about Imran Khan 5) Culture differences from Europe and USA. Corruption scandals are disastrous for the political forces of Europe and the US, but in Pakistan not so 6) The Economist Intelligence Unit expect the PML-N to be reelected on the back of a strong showing in Punjab, the most populous province 7) Low number of forecasters for that question in GJO 8) There is good news from dunyanews (local source of information) for PML-N"
