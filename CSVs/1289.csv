First, polling indicates that Gillum has an average lead over Ron DeSantis (R) by 4.4 percentage points in major polling. (https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2018/governor/fl/florida_governor_desantis_vs_gillum-6518.html) Second, Trump's approval rating in the state has fallen 20 percentage points since his inauguration (https://morningconsult.com/tracking-trump/). Trump holds only a slight favorability rating in the state, and his approval rating is on the decline. Polling out of Quinnipiac demonstrate that his approval rating may be as low as 44 percent, compared to an unfavorable rating of 54 percent. (https://poll.qu.edu/florida/release-detail?ReleaseID=2572) Third, RonDeSantis has a significant degree of controversy surrounding him. He has made statements that were deemed to be racist in debates against Gillum and has accepted the support of white supremacists. (https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/25/18022094/gillum-desantis-florida-governor-debate-racists) Lastly, young voters in Florida and others are energized to rally behind the March for Our Lives movement to elect politicians who will not take money from the NRA and will support comprehensive gun control reform (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/us/politics/march-for-our-lives-gun-control.html). Thus, the candidate who aligns most with this position is Andrew Gillum."

However, I am estimating that Andrew Gillum will win the Florida Governor's race with a 60% margin of the votes. As recently as today an NBC poll shows Andrew Gillum winning the election. Although Florida went red in the 2016 election, I believe Ron DeSantis is too strong of Trump supporter for Florida voters. He defended Trump's policy of separating families - a very contentious stand, especially in Southern Florida. This would be the first time in nearly two decades a Democrat has held the governor's seat. As a result, Andrew Gillum has monuments support from Democrats - most recently Obama campaigned for the governor. It is for these reasons I believe​ Andrew Gillum will win the seat."

A St. Pete Polls survey had Gillum slightly ahead 47-45 (2.0 percentage point margin of error). A Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy had the two about even, at 45 percent for Gillum and 44 percent for DeSantis (3.5 percentage point margin of error). A Strategic Research Associates poll also had the two about even at 44 percent for Gillum and 43 percent for DeSantis (3.5 percentage point margin of error). These new polls, which were conducted in late September, showed a tighter race than earlier polls. The race saw several major endorsements as well. Former President Barack Obama (D) and Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló (D) endorsed Gillum. DeSantis was endorsed by the Florida Police Benevolent Association (PBA), which backed now-U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist (D) over incumbent Rick Scott (R) in the 2014 gubernatorial election."

DeSantis supports open carry on college campuses and while FL has an enormous amount of guns rights supporters this is also the state of Parkland High school, the seed of the youth of the Never Again movement.
