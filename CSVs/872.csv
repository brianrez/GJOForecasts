Georgia has 912 confirmed deaths, but due to the nearly linear nature of the current spread I think it will fall just shy of 1000 cases, unless there's a small spike, which is possible. Maryland has 910 confirmed deaths, and has been rising rapidly (>50 deaths a day) for the past few days, so that will likely top 1000 by May 1st. Indiana has also seen a climb towards 1000, and I prjoct it will be very close to 1000 on May 1st. It's nearly a coin toss on whether it will cross the threshold. Other climbing states (Washington, Colorado, Texas) are too far removed from the threshold to cross it in the remaining four days, unless an unforeseen increase occurs. Therefore, I expect the total amount of states to be between 10 and 12. 10 I believe to be the likeliest number, followed by 11. 12 or higher will become increasingly unlikely."

These follow a little after initial outbreaks but because of the circumstances are often almost explosive. 1/3 to 1/2 a ward dies in days. Another factor is that the excessive deaths show an underreporting in probable covid deaths that is reduced when testing is increased like now is happening. There for chances are the number of deaths might increase. 9 states have reported more than 1000 deaths according to cdc. But Florida Texas and Connecticut have significant lower deaths to cases ratios so they might increase significantly in the coming week. The relaxation of lock down measures will have some effect, but it will take 2-4 weeks for people to start die, so that will not be measured within the timeframe."

Active cases in these states are all over 14,000. So another 500 deaths each is a 3.6% death rate on active cases (lower than the current rate of a little over 5%). 10 days is enough time for the unfortunately result. So this comes to 12 states. Then you have 4 states with around 10000 active cases (as of Apr 19) and close to 500 deaths to date. Two of the four would give us 14 states. There is some chance that we will not reach the 14 states in the remaining 10 days (which would be good news) and that is the reason I have not said 100% more than 13."

To project deaths in 2 weeks, I made several assumptions: 1) For states that report ventilated patients, I assumed that 70% will die in the next 2 weeks based on published estimates ranging between 55-80%. Also, average ICU length of stay is around 2-3 weeks. 2) For states that don't report vent stats, I estimated that the ICU mortality would be slightly lower (50%) since hospitals in most states are still below capacity and may still accept non-intubated patients in their ICUs. 3) For states that did not report ICU or vent stats, I estimated that the overall hospital mortality rate would be 10%, since these patients are moderately-severely ill. Using this algorithm, I identified an additional 3 states likely to exceed 1000 deaths: CA (1393-1674) CT (1164) PA (958-1180) Therefore, I am very confident that 9 states will exceed 1000 deaths within 14 days. There remains a small possibility that localized outbreaks may develop. Nursing homes are very vulnerable. WA showed us that deaths can escalate quickly in this population due to patient factors (age, chronic illness) and staffing (high ratios, staff working in other nursing homes). I took CDC data from 2014 about the number of nursing home beds and calculated the potential deaths assuming a statewide 1% mortality rate among all NH patients. An additional 5 states met the 1000-death threshold: FL (83k NH beds; 1500 proj), GA (40k beds, 1017 proj), IN (60k beds, 1077 proj), OH (91k beds, 1299 proj), and TX (136k NH beds, 1750 proj). But I think the chances are very low in the next 2 weeks this will happen."
