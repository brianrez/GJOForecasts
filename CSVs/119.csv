The expectation is that inflation will start to trend downward as spending decreases and output increases. However unemployment has remained low and home values have stayed relatively high which gives the Fed some extra room to continue to increase rates without significant downside. The high oil prices however make a recession a very likely and hard to balance risk that I think will keep the Fed raising rates incrementally in the 25 basis point range unless the current trends reverse. Unless they regularly continue with 50 basis point jumps then they will not exceed 3.25 and likely will stay below 2.25
