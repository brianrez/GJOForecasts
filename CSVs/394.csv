If she wants to become PM she also needs to look electable to the tory voters that are currently abstaining/voting lib dem in by-elections and I don't think being rash would help her case when she can instead wait it out for now by setting a later target date to resolve things. I also can't imagine the EU triggering article 16 in January as Maros Sefcovic said that he wants to be pragmatic and have a clear date to resolve issues, with January being an important month - not the words of someone about to trigger Article 16."

I don't see the EU agreeing to this (0%) but the EU might make some minor concessions (still seems highly unlikely 20% chance). The pressure from the UK might stop the EU from reaching internal agreement on ramping up the pressure on the UK. Not sure what the odds are but I do think it's possible the EU starts pushing back on the UK regardless for not implementing the protocol giving the UK government the excuse to axe the protocol or making it think the political wins favor them ditching the protocol (This outcome has some potential: 5$) Even without this happening Johnson may throw the dice anyway if he feels it's the only way he can secure his short term political survival when another self made crisis hits the UK (Christmas / Covid / Electricity / Fuel 2.0). 10% I feel I might be low here actually as there is an actual deadline, yet I do feel the idea is so incredibly stupid that I can struggle to belief the odds should be higher than this. https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/04/david-frost-issues-veiled-treat-to-ditch-northern-ireland-protocol-brexit"

After complaints from the all the relevant parties, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen backtracked on the same day, labelling the move as a mistake misjudgement blunder or mishap. So, the answer is that this event has happened (for one day). However, assuming the intention of the question is for the triggering to last more than one day, I will suggest the following: Article 16 does allow for unilateral action if there is ‘serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist, or to diversion of trade.’ The Union and the UK shall use ‘their best endeavours, in good faith and in full respect of their respective legal orders’ which I suggest is deliberately vague. The UK has threatened to pull out of the protocol over difficulties for the movement of chilled meats, medicines, pets and plants, among others. The EU have stated that cannot be renegotiation of the protocol. This suggests that a stalemate is in the offing with sabres being rattled. There are perhaps other issues at play here due to Brexit and the Belfast peace agreement. The protocol which is a result of Brexit created a border in the Irish Sea that has developed into political eruptions coming into play in N.I. The Conservative government cannot be seen to help break up the Union of the UK and can (will) not allow for arbitration with the European Court of Justice which would defeat the object of leaving the EU. The Eu has insisted on the full complement of customs inspections that are not used in other border jurisdictions suggesting a degree of intransigence and perhaps an attempt to split NI from the UK. Any negotiations with the EU tend to go to the wire. Perhaps realpolitik and pragmatism to forgo a threat to trade will prevail. Merkel is stepping down and Macron’s popularity is slumping with Presidential elections in April 2022, the chief antagonists against renegotiation of the protocol will be gone. https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/840230/Revised_Protocol_to_the_Withdrawal_Agreement.pdf"
