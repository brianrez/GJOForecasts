But Mr. Albright said “it is reasonable to skeptically accept that North Korea is working on some type of thermonuclear device, likely one aimed at using thermonuclear materials to significantly boost the yield of a fission device.” His institute has predicted that “in a worst-case assessment,” North Korea could field a crude thermonuclear weapon with a yield approaching 100 kilotons soon after 2020, or possibly sooner. North Korea’s claim came just days after it sent a ballistic missile over Japan, escalating recent tensions over its pursuit of nuclear missiles. Mr. Trump has threatened to unleash “fire and fury” on the North if it continues to threaten the United States with a nuclear weapon."" https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/02/world/asia/north-korea-hydrogen-bomb-missile.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fasia&_r=0 Bombastic threats......"

More frequent shows of ""strength"" via nuclear tests are therefore more likely to result as a last-ditch effort to solidify power on the international political stage.

Such a step , which must surely be based upon detailed intelligence, might usually be delivered behind the scenes through diplomatic channels. The use of chemical weapons requires tell-tale preparations such as the movement of particular units, the distribution of weapons to a base from which they can be delivered and so on, all capable of being picked up by US satellites or drones. The warning is clearly intended to forestall such an attack and to make it clear that if the Syrian regime again crosses this line - just as it did last April - the US will respond with force. This time though the context is very different. There is growing friction between the US and pro-Assad forces. A US strike now would risk Washington being drawn further into the conflict.

The new details about the exercises, which also involved Japanese warships, were disclosed as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis arrived in Singapore for a security conference during which concerns over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs are certain to be front and center. “This is about readiness,” said David F. Helvey, a senior adviser on Asian security issues to Mr. Mattis. “This demonstrates that the United States has military capabilities across the western Pacific, including in the Sea of Japan.” He added: “It sends a message of reassurance, and it does send a message of resolve.

In recent years, North Korea has shelled South Korean islands and sunk a Naval corvette, claiming dozens of lives, including civilians. To fund its weapons program, the regime produces narcotics, fake currency and uses cybercrime across the globe. However, the broader point is that North Korea, for all its many and egregious faults, is a state hell-bent on survival. It might have nuclear weapons, but the regime cannot use them without guaranteeing its own destruction. That’s how nuclear deterrents work. “Why are people panicking about North Korea?” asks Daniel Pinkston, an East Asia expert at South Korea's Troy University. “It’s secular, they want to survive and they are very cognizant of power balances. They are not suicidal.” Unfortunately, there is little chance the regime will voluntarily give up its nuclear weapons. Kim Jong Un is very aware of the fates of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi and Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, who were both toppled after abandoning their nuclear aspirations. He believes a nuclear bomb guarantees the security of his regime. And he might be right. North Korea already is a nuclear power. Its first nuclear test was over a decade ago, and analysts say it probably has enough material for a dozen bombs today. From the Soviet Union and China to India and Pakistan, each new member of the nuclear club has faced a frosty reception. There are few good reasons to welcome North Korea, not least the effect it would have on nuclear proliferation, most notable for Iran. But there are absolutely no good reasons to start another Korean War. http://time.com/4759066/north-korea-kim-jong-un-donald-trump-nuclear-weapons/"

North Korea should not think that it has once again broken through the pressure from the global community. If it continues to go its own way, sanctions from the international community will become more stringent and the US will seriously consider launching military strikes against it.

China unhappy with US plan to place THAAD in S. Korea in response to NK nuke & missile activities: DETAILS & LINKS http://newspaper.iran-daily.com/newspaper/page/5576/1/74496/0 China halts N. Korea coal imports after missile test (China) will temporarily stop its imports of coal from North Korea for the rest of this year (including coal for which customs applications have been made but not yet processed),” the Commerce Ministry said in a statement posted on its website. The statement said the suspension was in accordance with existing UN sanctions imposed on North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs and would come in to force today and remain until the end of the year. The decision came less than a week after North Korea’s latest missile test. North Korea’s launch came just after a conciliatory phone chat between US President Donald Trump and his counterpart Xi Jinping of China – the North’s only major ally. The United Nations Security Council, which includes China, sharply castigated Pyongyang last Monday for the missile test a day earlier, describing it as a “grave violation” of UN resolutions and threatening “further significant measures”. On Wednesday Pyongyang defended the launch and slammed the Security Council’s condemnation. The rocket launch was the first since Trump came to power. The US president has repeatedly called out China for doing too little to help stop North Korea’s nuclear program. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Friday used his first meeting with Chinese counterpart Wang Yi to urge Beijing “to use all available tools to moderate North Korea’s destabilizing behavior”. Pyongyang is barred under UN resolutions from carrying out ballistic missile launches or nuclear tests. North Korea blasted off a series of missiles and conducted two nuclear tests in 2016 in its quest to develop a weapons system capable of hitting the US mainland. The Security Council has imposed six sets of sanctions since Pyongyang first tested an atomic device in 2006. Beijing traditionally ensured that UN Security Council resolutions on sanctions against Pyongyang included humanitarian exemptions, and had continued to purchase huge amounts of North Korean coal – $101 million worth in October alone – a crucial source of foreign exchange for Pyongyang. But the latest resolution, passed in December, had no such clause and Beijing suspended purchases of coal from the North – for three weeks to December 31."

This suggests to me that the country is no longer using nuclear tests as a bargaining chip and instead using them to test new designs and equipment. Given the complexity of designing miniaturized nuclear weapons, this seems like something that the country would need to test every few months, even if just to make sure they are still on the right track. Since their last two tests were nine months apart, I think their next test will be somewhere around 9 months after their last test (not scientific but had to pick something) so sometime in the first half of this year. Plus I think they will want to set one off early in Trump's administration to test test him."

He needs to test to increase yield. He may have 29 bombs but they are only Hiroshima level That is consistent with miniaturization of war head require for center of weight in nose cone to make re:entry of nose-cone on a gps co:ordinated missile. But he may already have a triad mobile lauchers, submarine launchers and fiixed hardened ibm silos. So to bake the cake. 1.) production of fissile material: see 38 North facilities map: uranium mines, mills, thousands of centrifuges and both plutonium- uraniumvweapons grade sufficient for 20 fission bombs, Kim III also working on H-bomb and based on years of 6 successful tests, he needs more underground tests for fusion 2.) weaponization- a big part is precise minaturizaton for accuracy upon re:entry 3.) delivery systems: Musudan can hit Japan, ROK, Midway now and per 538 Kim III a long way from an ICBM"

I slightly raise July-Dec probability to take this into account. I still think it is unlikely to occur soon. Test timing is very important to the DPRK and I imagine they will wait until some key moment for Trump. My probabilities will go up dramatically if an ICBM test occurs. Until I remain lowish"

Beginning with a fourth underground nuclear detonation in January (claimed by the regime to be an H-bomb, but more likely a souped-up A-bomb) followed by a number of tests of the technologies behind nuclear-armed missiles, Pyongyang carried out a fifth nuclear explosion on September 9th. he North now boasts that it can make a warhead small enough to fit on the Nodong, something American and South Korean officials were already convinced they could. These missiles can reach targets in Japan and South Korea, including American bases There are also worrying signs of progress in the development of its longer-range missiles. Although three tests of an intermediate-range 4,000-kilometre (2,500-mile) Musadan missile failed in April, North Korean engineers learn from their mistakes, and further tests carried out in June were partially successful America needs worked-out plans to seize or destroy North Korea’s nuclear missiles before they can be used. China’s co-operation, or at least acquiescence, will be vital. So clear and present is the danger that even rivals who clash elsewhere in Asia must urgently find new ways to work together. http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/09/troubling-trajectory ------------------------------ COMMENTS: Raising the chances of another show as a show off to the new US President; After that Asia must find a way to work together against NK"

( this is a summary of a Stratfor interactive graphic from April) ( stratfor all rights reserved (c 2016) The underground facility near Hagap is similar to the underground facility near Kumchang-ri. Construction began at both sites around the same time, by the same engineering unit that had worked on the Yongbyon nuclear complex. While not as much is known about the Hagap facility, it would likely serve a similar purpose to the Kumchang-ri facility, possibly as a uranium enrichment facility.. YONGJO-RI URANIUM ENRICHMENT FACILITY The Yongjo-ri complex was initially thought to be just a missile base, but its hidden location in mountainous terrain makes it a potential site for clandestine activities. It has been suspected of being a uranium enrichment facility. CHEONMA-SAN URANIUM ENRICHMENT FACILITY According to South Korean media quoting an alleged Chinese intelligence report, North Korea operates a clandestine uranium enrichment plant at Cheonma-San; a large underground complex buried 2.5 kilometers into a mountain. The site allegedly houses several large chambers where uranium ore is processed into yellowcake. KUMNHO-CHIGU LIGHT WATER REACTOR The light-water reactor in Kumnho-chigu has no direct role in the North Korean nuclear weapons program as it does not produce fissile materials that can be used in a nuclear device. Therefore, it does not result in any expertise that has not already been achieved through other facilities. TAECHON GAS-COOLED REACTOR North Korea planned to build a 200MWe reactor at Taechon for the production of plutonium and electricity generation. Construction, however, was suspended indefinitely in return for oil deliveries to North Korea."

I'm mainly forecasting on the former which is consistent with earlier questions for me. I accept the expectation that the DPRK is not limited by resources (either fissile material or access to other important pieces). Would KJU test before the US elections and run the risk that one or other of the main candidates would go out on a limb to show ""resolve"" that might lead to a bad outcome? In some sense it might make more sense to just coast as an acknowledged nuclear power."

Now is the time to deploy THAAD. Although there was some political pushback to Ptesident Parks decision, everyone in Japan and Korea is under a real threat of a Hiroshima event in Hiroshima and throughout Japan and Korea. PRC leadership will not take sufficient steps as DPRK only ally and anything but pouring more sanctions on is not in Xi Ping playbook. PRC will not shut off petroleum or other necessities as fear of North Korean pouring 20 million people in Manchuria dominates. One more reason is that Beijing and other population centers are in range of DPRK. Is Kim III a master macchiavellian or a gangster. Makes no difference. I assume and past projections indicate that Kim III will keep manufacturing and testing until DPKR deterrent equals that of Pakistan. All this stems from the lab of Dr.A.Q.Khan."
