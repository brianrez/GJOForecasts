This sudden outbreak of vaping illnesses and death is intriguing and it points to possible links to recent changes in vaping products. There are indications that suggest chemicals (THC, Vitamin E acetate and others) added to vaping oil are potential causes [2], but it will take time for the CDC investigation to arrive at a conclusion, probably till May next year."
