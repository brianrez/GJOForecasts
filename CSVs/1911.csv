Will there be a new episode of mass killing in Pakistan before 1 January 2017?,2016-05-25T17:00:19Z,2016-12-31T18:00:41Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],784,654,195,237,"For more information on what constitutes an episode of mass killing, see the Early Warning Project’s Definitions Page. According to those criteria, Pakistan has an ongoing episode of mass killing perpetrated by the Lashkar-e-Jhangyi militant group (EWP). This question pertains to the risk of a new episode of mass killing. The Early Warning Project’s 2015 statistical risk assessments identified Pakistan as one of the 10 countries at greatest risk of an onset of a new episode of state-led mass killing (EWP).Those forecasts do not assess the risk of mass killing by non-state groups, which would also produce a “yes” answer to this question. This question will be resolved by the Early Warning Project, in consultation with subject matter experts, using publicly available secondary sources. If the project determines that a new episode of mass killing has occurred, relevant evidence will be summarized in a post on EWP's blog. Recommended Questions: Will Afghanistan's parliamentary elections be held as scheduled on 15 October 2016? Will there be a new episode of mass killing in Bangladesh before 1 January 2017? Will there be a new episode of mass killing in Zimbabwe before 1 January 2017? This question was closed as a ""no"" with an end date of 31 December 2016. The EWP did not find evidence of a new mass killing episode in Pakistan before the end of 2016 (Early Warning Project).

30163,2016-11-10T18:18:39Z,1,[35.0],[35.0],Statistically there have been the lowest number of incidemts since 2008 however Q1 / Q2 have seen increasing fatalities from individual incidents. An upward trend towards sectarian violence is also evident as splinter terrorist groups switch towards more extremist ideologies targeting ethnic and religious minorities. government security forces are at odds with political groups such as MQM with a largely Shia demographic and as such do not offer similar levels of protective security. Other factors such as increasing access to Internet across the region amongst well educated but unemployed youth create ideal conditions for self radicalisation towards extremist terrorist groups. Geopolitical tensions between Pakistan and India have also increased along the kashmir line of control and whilst both militaries exchange cross border mortar engagements militant groups outside of governmental control are likely to exasperated the conflict for their own means provoking and over reaction from one or both of the two military border forces.

Lodhi may be correct in suggesting that peace in Afghanistan is the essential next step, but unless Pakistan is prepared to do more than whitewash its ""alleged"" sponsorship of terrorist groups in Afghanistan, Kashmir and beyond, real peace just ain't gonna happen. Wikipedia lists eight distinct terrorist events for 2016 - so far - with at least 146 fatalities. These numbers almost certainly lag well behind honor killings in the same period, an ongoing episode of mass killing if ever there was one. Keeping my forecast low at this stage. There is a high probability of further terrorist attacks, but a low probability that there will be a surge from a group with no links to LJ - accounting could prove tricky. Balochistan is a bit iffy, although anti-state violence across Pakistan was at a seven year low last year and I don't yet see signs of this reversing. http://www.dawn.com/news/1249317"
