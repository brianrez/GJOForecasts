Summer slowdown of the financial markets further points against quick issuance. Recent political developments in US-Iran and Israel-Iran relationships are not conducive to foreign-denominated debt offering. On the other hand if oil price rises further there might be more interest in financing an oil-producing economy, but then again, the government debt might not be the most interesting market for global investors. There is a global appetite for yield and low-grade high-yield bonds might attract interest, but on the other hand yields on high-rated government debt have been rising lately which might reduce interest in low-rated issues. Main factor though is the short time-frame. Given how slow is the process of issuing rating, underwriting a new bond issue and securing initial sales I see it as very unlikely that anything will happen before November 1st, 2018, and definitely not before end of July."
