I expect CPI to break into double digits YoY over the next few months, and that was before neon supplies vanished (for chip production) as well as food/fertilizer/energy shortages.

The rate of increase needs to be above 2pts per month to be in the >15% band, above 1.5 to be in the >12% band, above 1 to be above 8 (below the current run rate).
