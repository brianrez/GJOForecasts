Therefore they even more likely rule to allow legal gun owners to use their guns in what is a common condition that is inherently safe, I.e. unloaded, not ready for fire and in transport. Further, a task that is needed for safety, practice as a shooting range, would certainly be allowed. To not allow practice at a firing range would endanger public safety - they would conclude. Therefore, the existing ban on transport to home or shooting range is unconstitutional."

If it is to be used up country or out of state, how can this be distinguished from transporting the weapon for purposes of trade, and what limits are there on the trading of weapons within and outside the city and state boundaries?

This morning the Supreme Court heard oral argument in a challenge to the constitutionality of a New York City rule that barred gun owners from taking their licensed guns outside the city. The gun owners argued that the rule violated their right to “keep and bear arms” under the Constitution’s Second Amendment. But it’s not clear that the justices will reach the merits of the gun owners’ complaint. Instead, it seemed possible (although far from certain) that they could throw out the case because the dispute is now moot – that is, no longer a live controversy – after the city repealed the rule last summer"
