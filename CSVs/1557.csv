The central question is if Beatriz Sanchez and her movement of 13 (!) different groups will endorse Alejandro Guillier and provide the necessary votes to give him a realistic chance. It's probable that already some of her voters will vote for Gullier but that won't be enough to present a real challenge for Pinera. Some groups have already decided to back Gullier while some have denied support. At the moment, however, Pinera is most likely the next president of Chile."
