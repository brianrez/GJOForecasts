It would be unprecedented for them to suffer such poor injury luck in two successive seasons, so it is safe to say that their star veterans will be back and playing well again. Add in their new star rookie Kyle Hamilton, and the Ravens will be a dominant force again under John Harbaugh's excellent coaching. The Bengals will surely be strong again, but they are likely to suffer a super bowl hangover, as usually happens. The duo of Jamarr Chase and Joe Burrow still gives them a strong chance despite the loss of several defensive starters. Without starting quarterback Deshaun Watson, who is suspended for 11 games, the Browns will struggle. The Steelers are easily the worst team in the division, heading into a rebuild behind famous darft-bust Mitchell Trubisky at quarterback."
