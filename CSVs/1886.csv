Who do you think voters want in charge of government to clean frack wells before they pollute the local water table and make their neighbor's land polluted? Many Suburbs must keep growing or die because their population density/tax revenue can't sustain their infrastructure ( example sewer lines a 1/4 of a mile in a city can easily service 10,000 in a suburb 2,000 may have to pay taxes for upkeep and replacement) you can't expand if the local farmland's water is polluted. Suburbs must grow and pass cost of replacement and maintence onto new residents."
