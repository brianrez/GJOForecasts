I have decided ot would not because who would pay to go through the arduous process of being selected as a volunteer? With all the requirements the cruise lines will need 60 days to prep to get the simulated cruise. Then they need a CDC approval. That is how the CDC will control the speed that this actually sets sail. The back and forth can delay sailing a long time. To me it makes sense, that the CDC capitulates to end the No Sail Order as Trump wanted, knowing it can still control based on its administartive requirements. If Trump loses Nov 3 then in effect the CDC will just ignore him till Biden takes office (call it Deep State or Fealities of Beuracracy). If Trimp wins then CDC delays until it can't no more."

Now, however, we are perhaps days away from reaching peak daily COVID numbers for the year, are back to 1000 people dying each day from the virus, and still have no mitigation or reactionary plans in place on a national level. Therefore, this question is no longer about what is right, but which is more powerful: the scientific community or the President of the United States?

And we are working with the CDC, we’ve got very smart people who’ve put a plan together to keep everybody safe and make sure that the fun is going to continue for you.” Unless you stay in your cabin with the port open, I don't see how this can be true. Eating dinner in your cabin can be loads of fun. An aersol below deck would appear to be a show stopper, will you sleep with a mask on? Will every passenger and crew be tested, that would appear to be a requirement - and how often. And likely no ""shore trips"". Call me old fashioned."

Carnival are selling a number of boats right now to sustain a prolonged market downturn. For this to happen (i.e. any cruise to depart in the US) two things need to happen: - a sustained reduction in covid cases to be observed. Right now we see a surge in cases, especially Florida which is a popular departure location. Such a reduction may occur in a month or two (October) or the autumn weather might even bring a second wave of pandemic, thus delaying the cruise industry restart. I assign 33% chance that October time brings a definitive reduction in covid cases in the US. - second condition is that other countries (Caribbean for southern departures or Canada, for Seattle departures) observe a similar improvement in covid cases, that allows them to open their ports. I assign the same probability to that. - finally, consumer confidence has to have returned to confining themselves in cruise ships. We are talking about relatively wealthy retirees. They will take their time to accept to take this risk. This means that with even a 40% capacity, the cruise ship is unlikely to be economic to sail. I assign a 50% chance to demand being there for at least one ship to sail, even when the 33% above has occurred. Overall, I think this bring the cumulative probability to about 17% for anything before January."

Given the current level of virus outbreak in those areas I am skeptical that they would go through. Also a fairly high change that the CDC extends the no-sail. Current evidence suggests most transmission is inside and there are unavoidably a lot of inside time in a cruise. I don't think testing capabilities will be ramped up sufficiently to test both staff and passengers. In October and November it seems more likely that cases in the south will decrease as weather moderates. Carnival CEO estimated that they have enough liquidity to last until next summer so it is not as dire to get revenue as it could be. It would likely do more damage to have a bad outbreak on a cruise ship than waiting longer. Politically it makes sense that incumbent politicians want to show life returning to normal before the election but pushing for cruises seems like a risky bet. Seems like the effort to open schools and restaurants will be a much safer bet.

In addition to what appears to be a second wave of Covid 19 in many countries, cruiselines that have restarted cruises have struggled to ensure the health of passengers. This appears to the case for Norwegian company Hurtigruten whose most recent cruise has had an outbreak of at least 41 cases of Covid 19 - see https://reut.rs/2XlFo9O. This is not likely to increase paying passengers confidence. Updated 20200731: Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings has suspended all cruises including subsidiaries, until 1 November 2020. (https://bit.ly/2PcIysa & https://bit.ly/2P9xgVy) There was a lot of bad publicity at the outset of the pandemic with boats full of people stuck at sea or quarantined in various harbours around the world. In spite of the desire by many to 'open the economy' or have the freedom to make their own choices, I suspect people that can afford cruise holidays are likely to be more careful with their health and hence potential exposure to risk of contracting the virus. Thus, they're likely to avoid cruising for a while. Much like shopping centres are being avoided. This appears to be confirmed by this article https://reut.rs/2P690Ui. In additon to the health concerns highlighted in this article, it clarifies the need for cruises operating out of contiental USA to comply with requirements of the ports of call intended and obtain approval from such ports. Hence, the no-sail order applicable to USA based ships is not the only criterion, albeit many companies has removed parts of the fleet from USA waters. Obtaining clearances from ports to be visited is also a requirement and that may not be forthcoming depending on pandemic or other conditions at thos ports. For example, in the Caribbean, the hurricane season may affect sailings as well."

There are destinations in the Caribbean where Americans can travel to, but would require screenings, fees, waivers etc, adding an additional negative hurdle to the experience. Carnival does operate cruises leaving from ports on the West coast, but Canada is closed to Americans, and cruise ships from Seattle to Alaska touch a Canadian port for most of the large carriers, additionally the peak season for cruises to Alaska season concludes in September for the major carriers. There are destination from San Diego in to Baja California. Covid cases in CA are increasing on an exponential trajectory; death rates in Baja California are increasing on an exponential trajectory. On the other hand, if by late fall, early winter, cases in California are decreasing, and cases in Mexico are decreasing given the lack of barrier to entry for an American passenger in to Mexico, that cruise could occur with masks and diminished capacity. Leadership in California has been more responsive to changes in the Covid situation while Leadership in Florida has...required blunt force to understand reality, leading to the 14% potential of a Carnival cruise leaving the mainland between 24 November 2020 and 15 January 2020."

I know sail dates have now been pushed to start in October for the U.S. so October / November is next best chance. Good news that the flu in the Southern Hemisphere is greatly reduced this year from past years may mean a late or weak flu season for Northern Hemisphere in the Oct/Nov period. That plus a slow down in the Corona virus should allow the first sailings for cruise ships since March.
