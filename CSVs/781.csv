I was also looking at past presidents and trying to figure out whether I should lean more one way or the other (basically gave them less weight as they arent as good of predictors). I will be bumping this up a little bit right now as Trump made an appearance today and he said 'it is what it is' about the death toll and I think that could bring his approval rating 1 point down. I will also be updating this tomorrow as I see how the website reacts to this piece of news

92817,2020-08-04T13:50:12Z,7,[15.0],[-15.0],"I'm lowering my forecast probability primarily because the expiration date is a bit under two days away (the percentage number used is taken on August 6). For the approval rating to be lower than 40.5% in approximately two days, it must drop by at least 0.9% from 41.3% to 40.4% (40.4% is the largest number which is less than 40.5% assuming 0.1% tick size). This implies two things: 1) The approval rating goes down - Given only two days, there most likely won't be much news, positive or negative, about Trump coming out, so I estimate this at ~50%. 2) The magnitude of the approval rating change within two days is at least 0.9% - My initial fair value for this is less than 30%, but I will estimate it at 30% because the approval rating moved a lot last week, and there are likely other factors I haven't thought of which would shift the probability up. I don't have too much knowledge on how much Trump's approval rating typically moves within two days on 538."

92805,2020-08-04T04:02:59Z,2,[45.0],[-10.0],"Trump's current approval rate is at 41.2%. Given that most of the coronavirus epidemic and race relation issues have been baked into the current approval rate, between now and the approval rate on August 5th, I believe the prediction will change based on noise and/or unexpected news. For example, something unexpected that happened was Trump forcing Tik Tok to sell its US division, which likely ticked his approval rating higher. While it was known that there was general suspicion about Tik Tok Data and being used by the Chinese government, it was quite unexpected that Trump would come up with such an order. Due to my knowledge that I had no prior information that would really give me and edge in predicting this, I stuck close to 50% with slight bias to the rating being down due to his administrations response to the coronavirus epidemic. I will adjust my prediction slightly lower given he is now .7% above the cutoff. This amount I believe is not significant enough to tilt my prediction on way, a it is not uncommon for the poll to fluctuate by around ~.5%, so I will adjust slightly, but maintain that mostly noise and unexpected news is in play, hence why I cannot really add additional confidence."

Treating Trump's approval rating as a random walk, I would ballpark the chance of Trump's approval rating being below 40.5% on August 5th as around 33%. Prior to the most recent polls, however, his approval rating hovered around 40.2%-40.5% for a few weeks, and there does not seem to be any recent major events that support a rise in his approval rating. This would indicate a higher than 33% chance, but as pointed out by several comments, Rasmussen polls are likely to be added to the 538 model soon, and those polls, which have significant weight in 538's model, have shown increasing approval ratings. This more than counterbalances the ""stickiness"" of Trump's previous approval ratings, so I assign my final probability as 30%, where I believe there is more volatility than the current crowd forecast of 25% seems to indicate, but assign a lower probability than I would have predicted before I updated on the information about Rasmussen polls."

Today (Aug 2nd) the approval rating is 41.2%, while just five days ago (Jul 28) it was 40.1%. The ability of the rating to fluctuate a considerable amount within the next three days makes my forecast air not too close to 0%, so I will settle in at 30% for now.

He has been trending upwards over the last three days, and the second stimulus check is coming out soon, which will boost everyone's morale. I think that it is more likely that his approval stays high given the success of technology companies on 7/30, and an increase in positive events this weekend; ex. NBA started, which will lead to generally happy people. However, there is definitely a chance something terrible occurs this weekend, and as an impulse reaction, we see a drop, especially given how close it is to 40.5%. Note: my interpretation is that a tie does not count as lower."

I would also put a slightly higher probability of moving down than up, given the severity of the coronavirus outbreak, the tumbling of the job market, the volatility of the stock market, and the push to open an economy with consumer dissuasion abound. This probability is only slight because Trump supporters have proven without fail their loyalty. I'll put this at 60% probability down versus up in the random walk. This is like going down 1/5 move per day plus variance, which is basically asking probability given std of 1*sqrt(7)= about 2.5 of being 2+7/5 = about 3.5 above.

This wasn't that useful, so I looked for indicators of Trump's approval among the population in the next few weeks. Based on my research, I think that the two key factors to pay attention to are the announcement of a potential covid vaccine and his poll numbers versus Biden. The first, while not directly related to him, has been a huge potential catalyst for his campaign that would be spun into a story about how he will curb the rising cases and reopen the economy, all good news for him. However, the chance of good news being released in the next week or so is low given all the information being released already. Second, his poll numbers have been steadily declining, which many of his followers openly remarking (both publicly in media and in polls) that his handling of covid is poor. However, it has been remarked that the 40% approval line is one that he's been defiantly above since early 2018, failing to fall below it since then, so it would take some major screw up for it to break through. Therefore, I'm not confident it will be below 40.5%, but it will be somewhat likely. (https://www.minnpost.com/eric-black-ink/2020/07/trumps-approval-ratings-are-dropping/)"

These factors, combined with his very stable approval rating, make it difficult to imagine it more likely that he gets a 0.4% boost. However, there are a lot of potential events that could help him. IT has been demonstrated that this floor is around 40%, and so by simple mean reversion, we see a possibility of a rise. He has embraced the realities of the pandemic, encouraging mask wearing and cancelling the republican convention, actions that are widely popular and may convince people on the fence about him. His fate is also tied to covid, and so any good news about vaccines or death rate could help his approval rating by proxy. Finally, events could be related to reducing Biden's support, such as his VP choice. This should happen soon, and an unpopular choice could easily lead to a 1% swing. There is also finally the reality that no presidential election has been this lopsided since Mondale, and presidential elections have had 2% gaps for the last 20 years.

92817,2020-07-27T13:25:21Z,4,[75.0],[20.0],"I'm updating my previous forecast of 55% to scale upward based on three factors: 1) Trump's approval rating is lower than it was during my last forecast. It is important to note, however, that the 538 approval rating can change by a couple of tenths of a percent each day, so an approval rating of 40.2% isn't too much lower than 40.5% as far as poll movement goes. 2) The time to the end of the forecast has decreased. Given that if the forecast settles to ""yes"" if it ends today, less time to expiry causes the probability of ""yes"" to increase. There are now only about 9 days before the end of the forecast. 3) Shuoyi's analysis on the aggregation of polls for the 538 approval rating. In particular, I just learned about the Monmouth poll, which comes out around the end of the month, and is weighted heavily in the 538 poll. The poll is typically lower than many others in approval for Trump (hence I can increase my priors for ""yes"" in advance), but given its large weight in the 538 aggregate, I will shift my forecast again after the poll is released,"

Currently, Donald Trump's approval rating is 40.2%, 0.3 percentage points lower than his rating on July 1, and been around there these last few days. The last few days of samples or so suggest that there's roughly a standard deviation of about 0.3% daily. Assuming random walk, on IID of 9 remaining days of samples, we might expect to see a total standard deviation of 3*0.3=0.9. Seeing an approval rating of >= 40.5% on August 5 is then approx 37%."

92813,2020-07-27T00:03:42Z,1,[85.0],[85.0],"As of 1 July 2020, Trump's approval rating 40.5%. From the relatively stable values of the approval and disapproval ratings over the past 4 years (start of Trump's presidency), it would seem like some mean reversion would occur and improve Trump's approval rating. However, as of July 26 (just 10 days out from the 5 Aug date), we are currently sitting at 40.2%. Given the linear trend since Covid occurred in rising disapproval and losing approval Trump has experienced due to the terribly inefficient administrative response to the virus outbreak, and since we're still in this phase with no immediate signs of turning the US outbreak around, the mean-reversion argument from before is much less important since the cause for the perhaps linear regime is still in place. However, it's also probably a good idea to weight the linear downward trend with the assumption that approval ratings also follow some sort of noisy random walk, given the patterns that are present in the graphs of previous presidents over time and accounting for massive news or global events that would sway approval in one way or another. On top of this, if we also assume just like in the previous 3 years there's an almost ""mental cap"" setting the lower floor at 40% approval rating (every time the approval rating has dipped below 40%, it has risen back over quickly), the random walk with downward linear drift between 40% and 40.5% can probably be some weighted average of simple random walk movement and approximating as (40.2-40)/(40.5-40) = 2/5 chance of hitting 40.5 first before the lower floor of 40 and weighted with some linear trend, we can say there's roughly a 60% + (100 - 60) * 3/4 = 90% that Trump's approval rating will be lower on 5 Aug. We can maybe further decrease a little bit since there are tail events that might occur, such as sudden vaccine news that would be reflected in the stock market and hence reflected in Trump's rating as well, or there could be an event of US handling covid better than expected in some end-of-month / beginning-of-month announcement in July, Aug. respectively that bolsters the ratings. However, the upside and probability of these are quite capped since it's more likely for people to respond negatively to something worse than expected than to respond positively to meeting or beating expectations, so we'll say final probability of 85%."

Could it have been his comments or was it more that he just quit talking? His rallies always seemed to energize him but not happening now. For me the question comes down to whether his pent up/no rallies energy spills out into his press briefings beyond today where he had a degree of discipline.

He lacks the ability to control what emerges from his mouth when he has an audience. Loose lips swing states, and Republicans didn't appreciate this the first time he did the briefings.

The most important driver of media coverage (and by extension Trump’s approval, though this is a complicated relationship worth exploring) would seem to be COVID news. Trump’s approval rating certainly lags COVID cases, deaths, and lockdown effects. His approval rating declined steadily as Americans were subject to lockdown and COVID cases and deaths rose. On the start date of this question, July 1, Trump was at his least popular in over a year, and lockdown restrictions were just beginning to be lifted. Since then, there has been a very large increase in new daily cases, but his approval rating has held steady (as of writing, it was 40.6%)."

Still, past instances of reversion (such as Dec 12, 2017-Feb 12, 2018) have taken multiple months so it may take longer than a few weeks. Looking at the specific circumstances of the current situation, Trump's rating has fallen consistently from a high of 45.8% on April 3. In the month of July the rating has stabilized in the low 40.x% range. This stabilization after 3 months of decline probably means Trump's response to the BLM protests and coronavirus have been factored in for the most part. Still, new information will come out in the next 2 weeks. First, the recent federal police crackdown in Oregon is the strongest action Trump has taken against the protests to date, but it is unclear if this will actually convert current approvers to disapprovers. Secondly, the second wave of the virus hasn't hurt Trump's ratings in July much but if death rates start increasing in response to the increase in case rates, his rating could fall further. Trump's rating was as low as 37% from July, 2017 to November 2017 indicating that he has not hit his all-time low yet. Thus, if the death rate spike occurs in areas with Trump approvers (where the first death wave did not) we could see his approval falling."

The president's approval rating is largely dependent on a couple broad categories 1) Stock Market Performance (we see large moves in the market correlate to swings in the stock market) 2) Domestic Issues 3) International issues. It's fair to say the biggest factors right now are the Coronavirus and the Black Lives Matter movement. As of 7/16, it's fair to say that Trump's stance on BLM has been factored into his July first approval rating. On the domestic front, Trump's re-election On the international front, the biggest issue is Trumps immigration policies and policy against China. I feel that in 2.5 weeks, the biggest issue that will determine the approval rating is the Coronavirus outbreak. I think a lot of the nation has realized his administration's mishandling of the pandemic and refusal to enforce medical advice has caused the disease to soar in certain parts of country. This is the main reason I see his approval rating dipping below. As more and more cases/death get reported, I expect for the approval to get down. It is a well known fact that there are supporters of Trump that under no condition withdraw their support, but I believe that number is lower than 40%. Due to the lag in COVID precautions and an decrease in deaths reported each days, eventhough precautions policies have been taken, I believe we will continue to see the death toll rise, and consequently, Trump's approval rating. I am only 55% confident however because throughout the epidemic it has maintained at this steady level with occasional bumps."

Instead, he is announcing to withdraw troops from Europe; however dumb this appears strategically, in POTUS's logic it may help him since this has always been a popular move in latest American history, especially among mothers of soldiers. He seems to seek support of veterans, and maybe get it: in his speech on the national mall on 4th of July, he put veterans first, even before doctors and nurses, which seems strange these days, but again, it has a certain pervert populist logic."

His approval/disapproval has been fairly steady... above 40% for most of his time in office with a few exceptions where it slipped into the 30's. Lately, it has slowly been creeping down to the 40.5% it is today. So, as we get closer to the election, things (polls) generally get tighter. August 5 will probably mean more US deaths and more people coming to the realization that there is no federal leadership which translates into... the US has the worst record in the entire world by far. Therefore, my initial guess is that approval will dip lower than 40.5% in the next month. But, the tricky part of this question is that we're talking about one day, August 5."
