The current offensive seems to been redirected towards cutting off the rebels' supply lines, rather than taking the remaining rebel positions in the city itself. It seems now that the city will only fall to government forces if the Rebels decide to pull out. Given that they are facing being surrounded, it could make sense for them to do this (hence a prediction above 0%); however, in similar situations elsewhere (Damascus for instance) rebel forces have preferred to fight it out, or to rely on negotiated settlements rather than make a tactical withdrawal. The chances of Syrian troops retaking Aleppo by tomorrow seem very slim indeed, therefore."

The Syrian approach seems to be taking a longer-term perspective, while the rebel approach is more short-term. The pro-Assad civilians in western Aleppo will be bearing the brunt of both strategies. Should the rebels break through, they might use that opportunity to skedaddle out of Aleppo altogether, which could happen quickly.

He and others suggested that Russia was providing close air support, including attack helicopters on the battlefield; high-precision strikes with missiles like the short-range Iskander; artillery support; special forces backup; intelligence; targeting; electronic warfare and, as seen recently in Palmyra, mine clearance. Although the bulk of the fighter jets flew home to great fanfare, they were replaced by attack helicopters that are less susceptible to the sandstorms that blow this time of year. Noting Russian news reports that private security contractors were replacing regular Russian troops in Syria, Aleksandr M. Golts, a veteran Russian military analyst and a visiting researcher at Upsala University in Sweden, speculated that the bulk of the force could become some kind of paramilitary organization not directly linked to the government — much like what Russia used to fight in southeastern Ukraine.""

Earlier this week, military sources said that the commanders of the Syrian Ground and Air Forces, their allies and the Russian military advisors, in a joint meeting, coordinated the last steps of a large-scale operation in the Northern province of Aleppo to liberate the terrorist-held territories as soon as possible."" ""The Large-scale operation to wipe out the militancy in Aleppo province is expected to start in the next 10 days,"" the sources said, adding, ""Fresh recruits in large groups are heading Aleppo from the coastal province of Lattakia."" Comments: Government forces are prepared for a major offensive in areas AROUND the city. Heavy resistance from IS and other rebel forces expected and progress will be slow. Less than 90 days remaining on this IFP. Incremental adjustment down."

Progress towards cutting off supply routes improves the chances of the regime to succeed with siege tactics which is what they are already exploring (http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/02/syria-aleppo-assad-russia/462231/). However, Aleppo is a rebel strong hold with several thousand opposition troops. The loss of the city would go a long way towards ending that dimension of the war in Syria (other than the fact that it might allow the government to redirect troops to the western part of the country the direct impact on ISIS will be limited) and as such it will not be given up easily. Allowing government forces to control all major urban centres in Syria legitimizes their role and strengthens their hand internationally as they would then be allied against ISIS with the wider international community. Any battle for complete control of Aleppo will be messy and likely prolonged."

Since Aleppo is important to maintaining Syrian control over its territory and that it currently maintains a normal civilian life and a state of destruction on the other side of the military divide. In addition, with Syrian isolation around what it consider rebel territory (along with partial territory controlled by IS), it would be able (in my assessment) to return Aleppo to territorial control by Syrian forces."

The Russians have indicated that they retain their interest in Syria that favors a victory for Assad. Aleppo, almost completely isolated from the surrounding rebel and terror forces is a primary strategic target for the Syrians and the Russians, as well as Hezbollah and Iran. With IS having lost 22% of their territory in the Caliphate, it now is concentrated in eastern Syria and western Iraq. This however does not imply a absence from other strategic areas it holds. Since IS is stepped in it's religious doctrine of prophesies of the 'end days' in the region of the Middle East, it holds an imperative (religiously) to maintain control and expansion in this part of the world. Must like the Crusades and the Ottoman's, it is sincerely committed to the extermination and eradication of religious traditions other than its own. However one can postulate that as degree of territorial control by IS in Syria/Iraq, we can expect increased spectacular acts of terror (that it envisions against the counter-terror forces in its military campaigns in Syria/Iraq. Consequently, counter-terror activity in the West should increase its deterrent and proactive activity in anticipation of what is to come. While the most recent campaigns of political violence in Dec, Jan, & February (2015-2016) might appear as disparate, the IS continues to emphasize in its recruitment and training programs (including the lone wolf activity in western countries as well as eastern states who oppose its advance, ie., South East Asia [Indonesia, Philippines, etc.]) that its focus should continue at the transnational (or international level) while simultaneously holding the current territories. Without territory to create a state (Caliphate), the IS project will be viewed by its actors as a failed project, thereby increasing the potential for exponential factionalism and spurning of more radicalized actors with greater determination to reach its objectives."

Iran has recently pulled out its regular army troops- which either means they are confident that Syria and Russia and the sectarian militias can do the work on their own.....or they think there will be a lull.

368,2016-03-01T21:55:03Z,1,[95.0],[95.0],"Based on media reports, with Aleppo territories controlled by terror networks, the Syrian regime is close to isolating the control of Aleppo by Jabhat al Nusra and ISIS (nonstate actors) with the assistance of Russia and Iran. It is reported that ""[t]he regime and its allies will likely retain their battlefield gains if there is no intervention by the United States, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, or the UAE."" While the military balance has been reset by Russia and Iran's support for the Syrian regime, escalation (despite the current cessation of hostilities which remain fragile) will continue, further improving the strategic military and territorial interests of the Syrian regime and its allied proxies (state actors). This observation provides a strong indicator of how close the Syrian regime is to containment, isolation and defeat of resistance terror networks (ISIS and Jabhat al Nusra ). If these types of conditions persist over the next three months (just short of the IFP closing) there is a high likelihood that the outcome for the IFP will be YES. The erosion of terror networks will also lead to strategic loses (in Aleppo) for them if the continued advances of the IRGC (Iran) and Russian forces on the ground persist. Since Aleppo is almost (but not completely) isolated militarily by the advances of the Syrian regime (and its allied proxies), we can expect a large degree of confidence that this outcome will occur. Since the conflict will also remain dynamic and ongoing for some time, despite the current (and short) cessation of hostilities, it is expected that the Syrian regime will continue its assault on Aleppo against Jabhat al Nusra and ISIS thereby shortening the current short term ceasefire."
