This was a huge step forward in regard to their relations. However, since only Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and President Park Geun-hye of South Korea were at the meeting, while China was represented by Prime Minister Li Keqiang (and NOT the Chinese President Xi Jinping), this question remains unresolved. There are no plausible indicators for a second meeting in such a short period of time - and time is runnig out: 0%."

She got a front row seat next to Putin who was next to Xi. Her prominent position was not by mistake. The last trilateral summit occurred before Xi became president. In the past the Chinese president has not attended, but Xi may not feel bound by how past summits have been handled, especially when his attendance can make a statement to the United States and North Korea. China’s relationship with the United States is more contentious now than it was in 2012. Also, think of the effect on Kim Jong-un (who has yet to visit China) if Xi chooses to go to South Korea for the summit. This question is one to watch and my forecast may turn out to be very wrong.

25,2015-09-02T13:11:54Z,2,[55.0],[20.0],"No indication yet whether this meeting will be with leaders or just ministers laying groundwork, but worth a bump in my opinion."
71,2015-09-02T11:42:44Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],Leaning towards no. No sign of great progress lately.
60,2015-09-02T11:36:46Z,1,[81.0],[81.0],"I'm really surprised to see all the pessimism for this IFP (or are we just calling them questions, now?)"
38,2015-09-02T07:33:54Z,1,[9.0],[9.0],"Abe has aggravated all his neighbors with his visits to Yasukuni & mealy-mouthed acknowledgement of Japan's WWII war crimes. Unless Kim does something that requires a unified regional response, I don't see this happening in the next 3 months."
67,2015-09-02T04:30:10Z,1,[45.0],[45.0],"I think all three parties have an interest in meeting, four months is a tighter, but not unrealistic time horizon for this to be announced and occur."
51,2015-09-02T02:02:35Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],Korea is pushing for it and Japan has always been willing as noted in GJDrew's good article link. It is notable that we don't seem to have much regarding China's position in that article. Chinese leadership is quite distracted for obvious reasons. And maybe China does not want to get in the middle of the latest North / South Korean drama until that situation has cooled off a bit more.
25,2015-09-02T01:51:07Z,1,[35.0],[35.0],"I agree with Darren's comment - 4 months in 2015, not a lot of time to coordinate a summit with these complicated parties. I'm under 50% at the moment but think there are compelling reasons this could happen."
42,2015-09-02T00:46:37Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],Not likely to happen. Xi has his hands full with China's economy and his political stability to worry about that.

34,2015-09-02T00:32:44Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"With only four months left in 2015, conditions don't seem to have improved the likelihood of such an event happening, which at an annualised rate of 30% seems to be a bit optimistic."
36,2015-09-02T00:29:28Z,1,[36.0],[36.0],Good link by GJDrew . As the Asia economic situation gets worse it might provide a positive reason to meet if it could head off a currency war.
26,2015-09-01T23:48:39Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],"Unlikely, these are very busy people ;)"
2,2015-09-01T20:00:29Z,1,[35.0],[35.0],Korea is looking for one.
