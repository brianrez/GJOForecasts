North Korea launched one ICBM on July 28th, 2017 and another on November 28th, 2017. Since 2017 there haven't been any specific North Korean missile tests since there hasn't been a missile test in almost ten months it seems unlikely that North Korea would test another land-based intercontinental ballistic missile. These developments seem to support the idea that North Korea has changed policy since the heightened tensions between the US and North Korea. Since the US announced a summit between the two powers, North Korea has promoted economic initiatives over military force. North Korea has also sought greater cooperation and unity from South Korea and appears to be dismantling rocket test sites. It's still uncertain if the peace talks will yield any results but with the possibility of a second summit, a laxation of the US embargo on the North Korean economy, and a lack of displaying any ICBMs at the DPRK's 70th anniversary it seems very unlikely that North Korea will launch another ICBM. If negotiations stall then North Korea may resume its test launches."

Additionally, North Korea did not display any ICBMs in a military parade held early September (see bbc link), which could be a positive result of the dialogue between the two leaders in the 2018 North Korea - United States summit."

All 3 DPRK ICBM tests occurred in 2017 - 0 so far in 2018, given Kim's other, ongoing political gains. But is it a stretch that after 3 tests in 2017 we'll see more in 2018, after the Singapore summit hubbub dies down? Some might claim this is even more likely to occur, several months after the summit, perhaps to bring an adversary back to the table. If 0 or 1 tests in second half of 2018, that's the 2-3 range, but seeing 2 subsequent tests may be more likely than we'd like to assume. Note the remaining DPRK holidays: Fatherland Victory Day 27 July, Liberation Day 15 Aug, founding day 9 Sept, not to mention New Year's Eve and the possibility of a test coinciding with a Xi speech, a Donald speech, US Nov midterms, etc. If not sooner than end of year, a ""Hwasong-16"" might be 2019 news."

No launches have taken place since last November, and since 2013, they have averaged a missile test (not necessarily ICBM) every 90 days or so. This means based on the time remaining, we'd expect about 2 additional launches given the overall trend. If we assume all launches will be ICBMs, which is not a slam dunk assumption - only 3 of the last 6 launches have been ICBMs - we'd expect the total to be 4 by the end of December. However, we'll take the more recent trend of about half of missile tests being ICBMs. Additionally, with the progress on peace talks on the peninsula, the risk of missile tests has become greater for North Korea, perhaps contributing to the lack of tests in 2018 so far."

Disappointing to have missed that just by lack of participation in the social media portion of predicting. A friendly reply just set me straight. Even when I don't mess it up like on this one the questions seem each year to almost never present opportunities to demonstrate actual strategic predictions, only chrono-based or numeric-based predictions among a known set of potential answers. A random choice of responses could probably score ok just by way of the potential answers being limited to a predetermined set of answers. Maybe I should make a cow pie bingo board for each question to make it at least more entertaining! I guess I feel I need a new type of challenge that has no scoring or ranked competition but instead asks for individually or group-derived predictions of events and conditions for potential events that are not yet on the media radar (i.e. what questions should we be asking now...in 6 months etc in this geographic region or globally etc). I'm not interested in or talented at reading all possible media and GJP thread posts and coalescing into a prediction among a known set...I and others are talented at using our experience and knowledge in specific geographic regions and in specific industries/ fields to predict the future developments that are simply not yet on the media radar or developed enough to form a questions with a set of known predetermined answers from which to choose a prediction. I guess they would serve two different purposes and both helpful but I am simply not interested in most of these GJP questions as stated anymore and feel they do not give any opportunity to use my knowledge of the world to make actual strategic predictions (i.e. Russia's role in middle east in last years...I and many others had many discussions about this in the GJP threads last year and even earlier, but we are just now seeing a lot of numeric/ chrono-based after-the-fact questions about the very events we were predicting in the thread discussions). The way the Russia challenge questions are now stated a monkey pulling answers out of a hat would literally have a decent chance at being a middle scorer."

It creates an incentive to play with fire, but the saber rattling is constrained by actual practices. In 1996, China launched the test missiles over Taipei, Taiwan, but it had no payload. The Clinton administration responded with two aircraft carriers into the region to deter any PLA mischief. By default, the North Koreans have become a virtual proxy for ""nuclear karma"" within the nearby Chinese strategic perimeter, and so the Chinese are free to pursue anti-access strategies in their ""near abroad"" with their own unsinkable aircraft carriers (islands) and one current aircraft carrier. North Korean missile tests are a highly convenient substitute for PLA tests over Taiwan, and the PLA can test the potential reactions of the American military under different scenarios."

Having established some level of credibility that NK is close to having the capability to deliver a nuclear bomb to the mainland USA, Kim has achieved the his first aim which was to get Trump's attention. It is probable that getting from ""close to"" to ""ready"" requires more testing, but if the object is not to start a nuclear war, but to look like a country that could possibly hit back with a nuclear bomb if provoked, then Kim might pause. It could be that the much tighter sanctions, and concerns of China and Russia are anyway making it more difficult to move the NK nuclear ICBM test forward. So maybe Kim thinks a change of tack is called for. For example on/off hints of visits to discuss talks at some undefined date in return for an easing of sanctions could allow his engineers to carry out work that does not require a full land based test. This could be dragged out for months (I recommend Kim use Mrs May's playbook; say that its clear what you want, in such a way that no one can figure out what you want, suggest some talks, but don't agree anything. Several years can be wasted this way.) Of course I could be completely wrong. It could be my cold medicine has affected my brain."

As far as the likely length and nature of NK-SK negotiations currently, NK is in a much better position now to influence negotiation terms in any eventual agreement with US via leveraging SK's desire for talks/ reconciliation / reopening Kaesong Ind Complex etc. The only terms consistently desired by NK seem to be an end to US-SK military exercises, an official end to Korean war and finally a US complete withdrawal from Korean peninsula. I don't see any hope for those all to happen this year, but I believe NK will convince SK to pause its participation in military exercises and in return hold back on launching any ICBM's...continuing as such as long as SK stays within the ""United Korea"" mindset (i.e. acting as buffer to US pressure). The Obama/ European agreement with Iran that left their missile development and arms procurement/ sales largely unlimited presents a very attractive model to Kim, and I believe Kim will engage SK, China and even the UN this year and take advantage of the widespread anti american views in the UN and the anti-Trump views of the press in order to paint NK as wanting peace and the US as bad actor who refuses to end military exercises or negotiate an official end to the war. As part of that I think NK ICBM launches will not restart until later this year if not next. NK has achieved its goal of showing it has the missile to hit the US so all that is left is verifying they actually have a warhead small enough to mount on an ICBM and that it can survive reentry. Even with those solved, NK isn't going to be able to match the US to achieve mutually assured destruction. So to me its more logical for NK to pause in launching ICBM's while they have gained in negotiating position and use that improved position to negotiate an end to US-SK military exercises as step 1 in the eventual removal of US from Korean peninsula. https://www.ft.com/content/f3280730-0f0e-11e8-8cb6-b9ccc4c4dbbb"

Web-searches and good discussion below indicates we are past the missile-launching season in North Korea for the year. There may be satellite rocket launches in winter. April to October appear to be the busy months for missile testing, based on Wiki data. Political initiatives and military action aside, assuming publicly-available data is accurate and not including Hwasong-12 testing, there has been one ICBM test to date in the time-frame, and possibly 0-3 more in 2018 may refine the technology: say 0-20% probability of one, 60-80% probability of 2-3, and 0-20% probability of >3 total over the time-frame. Also, there may be possibility of testing new missile designs, e.g., satellite rocket adaptions? Assuming military spending is limited, North Korea's spending priorities may be driven by other gaps in reaching its objectives, e.g., warhead development: lack of information would 'flatten out' estimates. How political initiatives and/or military action would affect these estimates is strongly linked to the question of probability that Mr. Kim will be around until the end of September, 2018: this uncertainty may increase the estimated number considerably."

North Korea is likely to launch the ICBM on the move before 9th of the month, the day it is established. According to the authorities, one ballistic missile produced by a weapons research institute dedicated to the production of North Korea's ICBM was found to be moving to the west of Hwanghae Island after being mounted on the 4th Mobile Launch Base (TEL) on the day after the 6th nuclear test. It is analyzed that the mobile launcher is moving at low speed mainly from the nighttime to avoid the eyes of the ROK intelligence authorities. The National Intelligence Service reported on the previous day that the possibility of launching the ICBM on the eve of the 9th day of the establishment of the regime was high. Therefore, it is estimated that a single ICBM moving westward of Hwanghae Island will be used as an additional ballistic missile launch by North Korea.

The Hwasong-12 is not itself an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), but it displayed all the technologies necessary to build a missile that can strike the United States. Its range is estimated to be about 4,500 km with a nuclear-weapon-sized payload (500 kg), falling short of the 5,500 km range that defines an ICBM. When North Korea tested an ICBM a few weeks later on July 4th, it used the same engine and underlying technologies first seen in the Hwasong-12. If we wish to understand North Korea's ICBM program, we must start with the Hwasong-12."

This will place some limit on the number of missiles they are willing to use for propaganda purposes."
