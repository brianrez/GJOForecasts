We have the commission on education debt relief, supreme court expansion, making DC a state. Joe Biden is so old school. This is how politicians used to kick the can down the road. Using adhoc bipartisian commisions to discuss items that can not be resolved by legislation. Although an executive order is possible there is no reason to use it. If the President wants to limit use of FRT it can be done by Agency heads. The customs and border control doesn't have to expand its current use of FRT. Biden can satisfy his base by having a really neat press release issued by Justice or DHS saying they are reviewing the use of FRT. Or the Justice Dept van investigate a ciry (pick any in USA) for the disparate impact of said city's use of FRT."
