It may be possible if they get a deal done that it comes in at less than $250bn of new money and reprograms existing funds from the CARES Act that are unspent. But a lot of high priority issues for both sides would be left out of any such deal which is why I believe there is a higher probability they kick it out to 2021 and make the provisions that expire on 12/31 apply retroactively (to the extent practical). Those expiring provisions are the only real pressure point to force a deal by this date and I just am not convinced they are enough.
