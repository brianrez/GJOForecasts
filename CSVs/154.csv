That's why I give them 98% chance of winning. Three factores seem to favor Caruso. 1 - Bass is a congresswoman and, for me, observing from Brazil, seems like more probably linked with the federal administration and the establishment of the Democratic Party. I don't know if she is actually of the party's ""inner circle"" or something of the kind, but her consistent record in the House of Representatives' elections (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Bass#Elections) indicates that she has got power and could be associated with the party's inner circles. As Biden's administration's approval has been deteriorating, as same as the Califronia governor's, this might damage Bass. 2 - Caruso seems to have a more conservative profile, been a billionaire, close the police (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Caruso), and so could appeal to Republican's turnout. An article on Los Angeles' recent change in the electoral rules has also given me the impression to have been more well received by conservatives, and has been criticized for possibly benefiting candidates with more access to funding (https://www.kcet.org/agenda/hoping-to-boost-dismal-turnouts-l-a-votes-to-change-election-dates). 3 - An article on the electoral scenery has highlighted Caruso's midiatic appeal with his proximity to Hollywood (https://www.latimes.com/california/newsletter/2022-04-02/la-on-the-record-newsletter-garcetti-factor-mayor-race-l-a-on-the-record), which apparently is in some way importante to the race. This is absolutely strange to me, so I don't give it much weight, but it is mentioned in a big newpaper's article, so it must mean something."
