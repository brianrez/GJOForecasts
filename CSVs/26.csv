So some other mechanism of removal is needed. It seems unlikely that he will resign, but with 6 criminal cases running against him, a tiny minority of Congress supporting him and mass protests, impeachment does seem quite likely."

108092,2022-11-14T18:50:59Z,1,[67.0],[67.0],Extremely conservative institutions provide limited support inside of Peru for Castillo. I am not more confident due to timeline and also possibility of other countries in the Americas providing support to his administration.

With the global economy also at risk of declining, I could see further pressure coming forth for Castillo. But I take caution because the closing date is still shy of the seven-year average. Only maintaining a 55% because the protests are already here."
