I think that is very likely given last minute flexible holiday hiring in several industries.

The downward trend of U3 since October 2010 will unlikely be affected, at least significantly, by recent, current, and ongoing developments until at least the first or second quarter, and even then, given the remarkable resilience of the US labour market despite the tumultuous geopolitical and economic climate. Finally, the fall and holiday season in the US will help maintain U3 if not push it slightly lower given seasonal consumption patterns. As such, I believe that U3 will remain below 4% and possibly even dip lower than the 3.7% of September and October 2018. Nonetheless, I have attributed small percentages to U3 both exceeding 4% as well as falling below 3.5% in the event of unforeseen circumstances and the recent volatility in the stock market, as well as the possibility that domestic firms are more confident in their economic outlook than the market suggests."
