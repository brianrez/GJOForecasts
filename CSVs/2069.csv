The motion stipulates that the Iranian administration should stop its voluntary activities and adopt reciprocal measures to restore the rights of the Iranian nation in case the other side violates the terms of the agreement, particularly on the Western sanctions. http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/10/four-ministers-warn-rouhani-economy.html?utm_source=Al-Monitor+Newsletter+%5BEnglish%5D&utm_campaign=94841768f4-October_06_2015&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_28264b27a0-94841768f4-102297633 The letter stated that there are eight reasons for the “rare decline” in Iran’s economy, such as sanctions and the drop in oil prices, but added that “uncoordinated decisions and policies” of various governmental agencies is the primary reason for the current economic situation. After the letter was published in the Iranian media, Teyebnia told Iranian television that upon receiving the letter, Rouhani had ordered officials “to review again the capital market situation and [state] of the economy and for new polices to be created when necessary.” Shargh daily asked why the four ministers would write to the president to address issues for which they themselves are responsible. According to experts who spoke with Shargh, the letter was meant to serve as a warning to Iranian parliamentarians to vote in favor of implementing the final nuclear agreement. Iranian officials opposed to the nuclear agreement, which would remove economic sanctions in return for reduced nuclear activity, have argued that Iran can pull itself out of its current economic situation by relying on domestic production rather than international markets."

Special Parliamentary Commission to Review the JPCOA member Massoud Pezeshkian said, “Not only are disputes a barrier to concluding [the report], but also if we want our views to be closer to one another, we [the Commission members] need more time and more scientific evidence.” Pezeshkian also criticized Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani’s comments on the JCPOA at an earlier commission meeting, stating, “As someone who has spent hours in the Supreme National Security Council and in the service of the Supreme Leader at meetings on the nuclear negotiations and the JCPOA, Larijani cannot have an unacceptable opinion about the JCPOA.” (YJC) ... Parliamentarian Hossein Sobhani Nia discussed Parliament’s review of the JCPOA and stated, “The ball is now in Iran’s court… The defensive, political, legal aspects [of the nuclear deal] in addition to the implementation of the Additional Protocol, sanctions, and snapback sanctions must be considered.” The National Security and Foreign Policy (NSFP) Parliamentary Commission member added, “Therefore, it is arranged that a double-emergency plan will be presented [to Parliament] which both permits the administration to implement the contents of the JCPOA and also considers the general interests of the political system.” (ICANA)"""

The reason for this is that this question is actually several questions and it is up to us forecasters to guess what the real question is in the minds of the scorers. I understand that IARPA has serious concerns about the need to decompose questions into their component parts, given how often GJP has developed problems with this given the current abilities of those who generate questions and refuse to give clarifications. My understanding is that only in the first two forecast seasons did the CIA provide questions. Sigh. If anyone knows otherwise, please correct me."

Unless the US congress manages to do something extremely stupid, I think the vote will occur before 1 Nov (the sooner Iran accepts the sooner sanctions go away from a practical perspective). I expect that opposition will be vocal, but it will pass the Parliament (alternative would be for a failure and and override just like the US is doing). So I weigh in at 80% yes for openers"
