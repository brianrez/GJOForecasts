With Jazz and Denver playing first round, this knocks down to either the Clippers winning vs. winner of Nuggets, Clippers. Recognize that the winner of this game will play each other, so once we reach the conference finals, we have at most 1 team to win it all. Naively assuming that each team has a 50% chance of winning, a first time champion would be .5*.5 = 25%, conditional on making to the conference finals. I would argue that Dallas has at least a 50% chance of taking the series against the clippers, which reduces the probability we would have a non-champion team in the western finals. Moreover, the individual strength of either the Nuggets or Jazz beating through the Western Finals and the NBA Finals against teams like the Clippers/Lakers/Bucks/Celtics is quite low, which also reduces my probability. Thus, my fair value is adjusted down to 10%, much of which is contingent on the Clippers. The clippers will most likely be facing either the Lakers or Rockets, both of which present mismatches to the playstyle. I favor the Lakers heavily over the Clippers, contingent on LBJ returning to playoff form and AD's health, and the Rockets v Clippers at least a coin flip since they split the regular season series. Bucks are also favored over Clippers, and thus halve my fair value to 5%."

Of the 11 first-time teams, only 9 (the Nets, Nuggets, Pacers, Clippers, Grizzlies, Pelicans, Magic, Suns, and Jazz) were invited into the bubble. With 22 teams total in the bubble, if every game were a toss-up you would expect a 9/22 chance a new team would win (41%). Now, 5 new teams have qualified already for the playoffs, with the Nets right on the edge of qualification. Assuming they make it, that means 6/16 teams in the playoffs could meet this criteria (37.5%). However, only 2 teams (the Pacers and Nuggets) are ranked in the top 3 in their division, with the average playoff bound team ranked at 5. Given that a 7-game series tends are prone to less upsets than 1-game matchups, this does not bode well for this prediction, so I am knocking a few more points off the forecast to 11%."

Though if the NBA does have a postseason it looks like it will be a 3 game series which greatly increases the chance for an upset compared to a 7 game series. Games will be played with no crowds and it is going to be a very strange atmosphere under these conditions which I think adds more uncertainty. Also 7 of the finals teams have never won the playoffs so I am adjusting the base rate of 27 up slightly to reflect the increased variance and the high amount first time teams.

In my experience it is a better estimation to take the strongest contenders -by far- according to betting odds as of today, which are Bucks, Lakers and Clippers. Clippers are the only ones from the never-won list. Because of the series format in NBA playoffs (3 out of 5 or 4 out of 7), some level of randomness is taken away from the opportunity of a new team to win (unlike NFL or other direct-elimination sports). So I will take the 1 team that has more chance out of the 11 never-won list and then adjust a little lower since the Bucks are really the favorite team to win this year."

Only three of those are actually title contenders (Nuggets, Clippers, Jazz). NBA playoffs have minimal upsets. The current favorites are Bucks and Lakers. Lakers vs. these three teams are 3-3 thus far. Bucks vs. these three teams are 3-2 thus far. Still too early in season to predict playoff matchups and order. ~50% chance one of the three first-time teams will have the chance to play against Lakers. Give them 25% chance of upset. Give another 25% chance of upset against Bucks. 0.5 * 0.25 * 0.25 = ~0.03. Initial prediction, 3% chance the NBA champions will be a first-time champion."
