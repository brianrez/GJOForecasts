""Markets have had a rollercoaster quarter due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, volatile commodities prices and the U.S. Federal Reserve starting to hike interest rates."" Inflation continues at record levels, but employment numbers are not disappointing, Fed Res hikes are on schedule, the pandemic is for now under control and most places in the US are in full reopening. The Biden admin plans to release millions of barrels of oil from its reserves to address hike in oil prices. So, what could go wrong in the next 2-3 weeks or what can keep propelling the S&P? An escalation caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine that would cause the war to spill outside Ukraine? Would seem that is something that is being actively prevented. A major cyber attack on the US or Europe? Vix indicators are more positive and the S&P has kept rising for the past 3 weeks. The index rose +216.99 (5.01%) in the past month so the question is if it can keep that up and then some for the next 3 weeks. Given the risks and uncertainty in geopolitical environment, I would err in the side of caution, for now, and assume it will be steady but will fall short of an all time high."
