North Korea has recently been pursuing better diplomatic strategies; South Korea would be an important first step."

Momentum is building in ROK and Kim III met Moon specs by stating ""denuclearization"" and stating no more missile wmd testing without requirement that US and ROK suspend exercises.....Moon's short term goal has been met. But the formula requires ""irreversible"" and ""verifiable"" removal of WMD capacity. AS we have seen with the Iran JCPOA meeting this benchmark with removal of fissile materials does not address ""miniaturization"" (Warheads) and delivery systems (icbms) (Kissinger Schultz critique of JCPOA) But it does allow Moon to make his flight to Pyongyang without risking any loss of face if a deal is not reached. Moon can now blame DPRK and US for the failure to engage in and complete talks. Short term: Kim III has succeeded in driving a wedge between ROK and US procedurally as there will now be 2 tracks Kim III -Moon on intra Korean issues ( family visits, Kaesong, reunification) and US-DPRK on denuclearization Us must ensure that any ROK concessions in Moon Summit are expressly conditioned on not just a suspension of testing but a US-DPRK agreement on complete and verifiable denuclearization"

So could go as far as agreeing to Moon Jae-in meeting Kim Jong-un. I would suspect they would want ""officials"" to hold meetings and get to some concrete negotiating position first, or at least clarification of what Kim has in mind. If sanctions are having an affect the longer SK can delay a meeting the better.

I see 2 things. 1. USA. Trump actually make this both easier and dicier. The stance against NK along with the crazy talks of war coming from the Trump administration put Moon into a situation where SK is at the highest risk if war comes but he is also at risk of breaking with the strongest ally of SK if he tries to prevent it via dialogue. Not a great position to be in. 2. Internal political groups that fear NK and Un. These groups are arguably the nearer influencers given Moon’s short term needs (being a politician). I think the games and yo Jong have done a good job so far building credibility for dialogue amount the public in general but there will always be detractors.

No invite for Trump will probably annoy Trump, but maybe Pence can get an invite as well. The problem for all concerned is that any solution to the NK problem needs talks, if the US refuses to agree that it is not unreasonable to start with a visit to NK by Moon Jae-in then the US looks like as if it standing in the way of a solution. Presumably Trump would want KIm to make a gesture (in order for Trump to save face) which Kim will not do (in order for Kim to save face). So I would say its not a done deal. It would seem to require some high quality diplomacy to move forward. I am not sure that Trump can be controlled enough to carry it off."

Moon has encouraged a meeting between him and Kim of the DPRK for some time now, and I believe they have a high chance of meeting between now and November due to yesterday's developments where Moon was invited by Kim's sister to visit the DPRK in the near future. According to reports coming out of the Blue House, Moon has ""practically accepted the invitation."" I believe it is only a matter of time before the two leaders meet to discuss a resolution to their decades-long conflict. However, the only thing that could stop their meeting from happening would be concerns expressed by the US which has flip-flopped on a lot of its issues regarding diplomatic interactions with the DPRK. As of now, it appears as if the US would not like the DPRK to engage diplomatically with South Korea unless it agreed to end or cut back on its nuclear program. I don't believe, however, that the US will stand in the way of these two nations meeting."

During the campaign that resulted in Moon's election, he stated that his first foreign visit would be to North Korea. That obviously didn't turn out to be the case but with the mini-thaw that is happening now and Moon's stated willingness it seems (somewhat) likely."
