Hamer is apparently meeting with Hoekstra (CDA) and Segers (CU) for further talks today, which suggests a continuation of the former coalition has become slightly more likely and could be the dominant strategy in the government formation now in order to achieve a quick resolution of a deadlock. With all the dirt that has come to light (new: https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2021/06/cda-confirms-publishing-millionaire-gave-e1m-to-election-campaign/ ) and the Omtzigt departure, the CDA lost support dramatically in recent polls and must be happy if they avoid a new election in the first place and if they are included in a new government. However, unless there's a miracle (see Rutte III cabinet = Rutte IV cabinet) immediately, a new government will not be sworn in before Friday this week. Thus, it looks like a demissionary government will attend the next European Council meeting next week. With respect to the government formation, Hoekstra and the CDA now must be considered as the most obstructive force, which is consistent with their lost parliamentary weight in the past 2021 election, probably a good deal of miscalculation and loss of reality and their fear of being marginalized in a new government, a factor that I have previously under-estimated. Lesson learned: be more critical of and constantly question your own assumptions. Two of my baisc assumptions (1. a new government will be needed for the ORD to be approved in parliament; 2. the government formation will be concluded before the June 2021 European Council meeting) have proven false, sadly. https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2021/06/hoekstra-omtzigt-exit-will-not-make-coalition-talks-more-difficult/ @bh4eh @Anneinak"

The need to form a government as quickly as possible is pressing. As @SE_Meyer pointed out, the next EU Council meeting is 24/25 June and as a founding member of the EU, it would not reflect well on Netherlands to have an empty seat at the table. Equally pressing is the need to approve the EU ORD amendment in order to release the NGEU covid recovery funds to the countries of the EU. Thus, albeit Sigrid Kaag of D66 commented that if she were Rutte, she would not continue seeking to form a coaltion around Rutte's winning vote in the light of this information, Rutte is an experienced and shrewd politician. As @tarun_b suggested to @Anneinak , Rutte knows how to get out of tricky situations. As indeed happened today with his escape from a vote of no confidence (https://bit.ly/3rLIZKL). That said, it is worth bearing in mind that Rutte's last government was forced to resign because of some rather underhand tactics by the tax office about child benefits (https://bit.ly/3mdRWeG) so one would not be remiss in questioning his honesty. Nonetheless, the Dutch voters gave him the most votes amongst many parties that stood in the election in March 2021. He must have some redeeming qualities."

I return to the fact that only 11 out the last 20 coalitions have taken less than 90 days, some factors involved in the longest formations are not present (eg last time irreconcilable differences between GroneLinks and the Christian parties; GroneLinks have not done well this time so unlikely to be involved) so I put the third bin down to only 2%; I think 90 days likely - but far from certain."

It's also interesting that even the Netherlands as a rather small, compact nation obviously have a rural - urban, likely old- young divide with respect to politics. This indicates that the D66 will want to play a much more important role in the upcoming government, which rocks the boat a bit, and it's pretty obvious there's no real way around the D66 for the VVD, unless they are about to forge a coalition of eight or so. On the other hand, D66 is not strong enough to lead a government themselves: even if they could forge a new movement of all other parties (and the one independent candidate) except for VVD, PVV, CDA, FvD and CU, they'd fail a majority with just 71 seats. D66 + CDA and six more parties would sum 77 seats, but even this is rather unrealistic at this point in time. The most viable solution seems to be a centrist government of VVD (34 seats), CDA (15; both conservative), D66 (24) plus either PvdA (9) or the green GroenLinks (8), which both seem to keep a balance of 2/3 conservative, 1/3 progressive - no hardliners and pragmatism before party politics -, which could in general achieve good results in terms of government projects and even reflect the will of electorate. I think it's rather a matter of details now, and 73 seats for the three most heavy weight-parties are a good precondition for a limited ambition of a fourth junior coalition partner that sees the necessity to support this mix of government politics."

The people will not be happy that in such a well-ordered country (apart from child payments) and a well-funded universal health care system, the organisation of the vaccine rollouts has been delayed due to its reliance on the EU. The riots over the lockdowns do not appear to be politically motivated (unlike those in the US) but a bored youth. This will annoy the general public into perhaps a more law and order vote, such as the PVV led by Gert Wilders who are second in the polls. The Netherlands has the most proportional representation of voting in the World which is meant to fairly show voting intentions across the country. Eighty-nine parties have registered for the 2021 election that will involve a lengthy period of negotiations to form a National government as in the 2017 election that resulted in 225 days of such discussions to gain agreement and determine the composition of the administration. If the same occurs in 2021 the negotiations will go on until September, possibly October. To study the polls where VVD (1st) has 26% and PVV (2nd) has 14% with the others trailing behind does not help in a determination of the final outcome given the complexity of the system. Given the diverse nature of the political parties, the negotiations could be arduous and lengthy, the odd one out being the PVV right wing anti-Islamic party of Geert Wilders, while being second in the polls will be shunned all the other parties who will refuse to negotiate with them, essentially taking 14% of the population out of the equation. The average time for resolution since WW2 has been 72 days, with a record of 7.5 months."
