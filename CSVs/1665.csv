An increase of that magnitude will only occur if there is a significant news event that triggers it, the most likely of which would be a higher than expected earnings report. Given that Apple does not report earnings again until January 30, it seems highly unlikely that the company will reach a market cap of $1 trillion by the first of next year."

This also applies to the domestic US investors at least those who are allowed by law to invest in to equities instead of bonds. So far I have been talking about the big guys the institutional investors. But wait for the retail chaps to enter the market and this alone could bring the market cap to 1 trillion level. Also any major disaser abroad like say Merkel loosing elections (seems unlikely but look at the Britain's late elections?!) would most certainly deteriorate confidence of investors globaly and thus send their capital to US market. On the flip side historicaly there has been I think only 1 company that reached a market cap of over a trilion $ (adjusted for inflation) i.e. Petro China.
