"Between 1 July 2017 and 30 June 2018, will an armed group from Myanmar engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Myanmar?",2017-06-30T17:00:37Z,2017-10-01T06:59:37Z,Yes,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],282,654,71,237,"The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (Early Warning Project). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 30 September 2017 and will be resolved in July 2018 after EWP assesses the situation in Myanmar from July 2017 through June 2018. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilian fatalities occur in one or more campaigns.

I spoke with Germans in Myanmar yesterday, the rally around the flag effect is immense and people in Myanmar don't pay too much attention to how this issue is being reported on outside their country. While Aung San Suu Kyi obv. will adress this issue in her speech, she will prob. continue to focus on other conflicts in Myanmar nontheless as also the population doesn't care too much about the fate of the Rohingya. I assume she will frame this issue as one of outside militias vs. the state of Myanmar against which people will have to unify. There are a lot of fake news out there (from both sides) and most people inside Myanmar probably believe that fleeing Rohingyas burned down their houses themselves to be able to accuse the government of ethnic cleansing and damage it's reputation. There are some video campaigns suggesting exactly that (although they are flawed as videos allegedly displaying residents burning down their own houses show the same man in multiply villages etc.). Meaning: There are militias in civilian clothing perpetrating atrocities & as the situation is developing right now, it is highly unlikely that the perpetrators will be held accountable.
