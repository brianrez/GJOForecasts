The Conservatives are likely to secure the most seats, and probably a majority: they lead Labour in the polls by an average of ten points. But that figure conceals a wide variation among pollsters, who put the Tories’ lead at anything between 15 percentage points (enough for a landslide) and just six (which might mean a hung parliament). The latter would be good news for Labour, because Mr Johnson, having promised a hard Brexit, would find it hard to woo other parties into coalition. Mr Corbyn, on the other hand, might be able to call on the support of the Scottish Nationalists, who will probably be the third-largest party, and perhaps the Liberal Democrats, the fourth.”"

Consequently, I have revised my forecast downwards, to 70:30. Having looked at all the polls, this time round, there is very little difference between MRP model conclusions and national average conclusions: a Tory majority is the most probable outcome, but a hung Parliament is possible. So what will happen? I go to first principles: what is the defining issue of the election and who wins on that issue, if anyone? The issue is easy to see: Brexit. In another era, ""NHS for Sale"" would cost the Tories the election, but Brexit is the big hairy beast that makes the slithering snake beside it look like a guardian angel. Furthermore, in terms of shifting votes, the Clinton-Trump election is instructive: for all his mendacity, Hillary Clinton had bigger trust issues than Donald Trump, precisely because people expected him to be duplicitous. ""NHS for Sale"" as an example of an issue that is not-Brexit, is not something that can really hurt the Tories because it is not a surprise. Who wins on the defining issue: the Tories, because they offer closure, whether you think Brexit is a historical triumph or the greatest self-inflicted geopolitical blunder of the last 6 or so decades. This does not mean a hung Parliament won't happen, I am simply explaining why a Tory majority is more likely. I will deny saying any of this when a hung Parliament emerges!"

I admit bias in that Economist view echos my own dislike for comrade Corbyn and the folly that is BoJo. “Next week British voters face their starkest choice of recent times, between Boris Johnson’s Conservatives and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party. Mr Johnson has ditched the Brexit deal negotiated by Theresa May and struck a worse one, and accelerated the shift from an economically and socially liberal party into an economically interventionist and culturally conservative one. Labour would attempt to deal with 21st-century problems using policies that failed in the 20th. That leaves a low bar for the Liberal Democrats, and they clear it. They have made an irresponsible promise to reverse Brexit unilaterally. But their economic approach is the most sensible of the main parties. They will not win, but there are two good reasons to back them. They would restrain whoever ends up in Downing Street. And a strong Lib Dem showing would signal to voters who favour open markets and a liberal society that the centre is alive.”"

The ruling Conservatives are ahead of Labour by some 13 points. But so far Labour might feel it has had the better of the contest. Polls suggest the Liberal Democrats, who threaten to take Remainer votes from Labour, are being squeezed as voters side with Boris Johnson, the prime minister, or Jeremy Corbyn of Labour. Meanwhile the Brexit Party, which will nab Tory votes, has said it will field a full slate of candidates, dashing Tory hopes of a non-aggression pact. Most significantly, the Conservatives face a higher electoral bar than Labour. Whereas Mr Corbyn could enter Downing Street with the support of the Scottish National Party, the friendless Tories need an outright majority. This remains Mr Johnson’s election to lose. But the race is tighter than the polls suggest, and seems to be tightening.“"

Despite the polling lead the Tories have at present, i do not think it is a cut and dried outcome that they will win the election. A lot will depend on the line taken by both Johnson and Corbyn. If Corbyn plays to the people and ignores his own instinct, he may offer an olive branch second referendum option (may, but probably won't). Johnson is playing a dangerous game by calling the election IMHO. He is already under scrutiny for conflict of interest issues, is not exactly trustworthy given his track record and has lost every motion/vote he has brought to the Commons so far. Labour could/should play on this to their advantage, and BJ may not be as teflon as he thinks. At this early stage I think a hung parliament is likely, with a Tory win more likely than a Labour win.
