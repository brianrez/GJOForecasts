There is talk in South Africa that this review implies 'junk status'; however, Moody's would have to move its rating down more than 1 level to reach junk status. @Pythagoras provides detailed links for news reports.

Currently South Africa has lost 30% of its currency value this year --- with more difficulties ahead as commodity markets weaken and growth in the global economy is slow. It's dependence on commodity exports along with severe depletion of its commodities (particularly in the gold sector) makes to irreversible trends."

The second problem is the timing. Moody's does not have an estimate for 2 months out readily available, so I make the assumption that the likelihood of downgrade increases with time linearly (they are more likely to get downgraded the further out in time we go), this is probably an oversimplification as the decrease in probability is most certainly not linearly based, but for purposes of simplicity this is what I have done."

In October Moody's were hinting that it did not expect to downgrade SA in the next year. In the last two weeks the world economy has been very volatile (e.g. further falls in oil prices and mineral prices). This is likely to cause money to move to the least risky countries (e.g. the USA) which could cause difficulties attracting funds for more risky economies (e.g. South Africa). Unlike similarly rated countries such as Spain, South Africa does not have a strong currency union standing behind it. Clearly what next month's budget brings is critical. The returned finance minister appears to know what needs doing and my guess is that the situation is bad enough for Zuma to allow him to do it even at the risk of political problems, however in the end I expect politics (the desire to win elections) will come ahead of good economics (long term benefits).

A significant effect on currency devaluation is external debt and external balance. The decline of growth among BRICs nations also has a significant effect of global growth in the global economy. Additionally, a sharp decline in commodity prices weaken trade balances, affecting external debt and external balances. Therefore, a relatively low rate of economic growth suggests that a country’s existing debt burden will become more problematic to service over time. Foreign indebtedness may become unsustainable over time."

I could not find evidence that a country as a whole has ever been downgraded 5 notches at once. Even though a downgrade by at least one notch seems likely and 2 even possible 5 seems to be very improbable. The ratings agencies in my opinion will not instill a 5 notch downgrade as it will reflect badly on themselves as well (for being behind the curve). I also suspect that the new minister of finance will keep government spending under control for as long as possible which should provide ratings agencies with at least some confidence.

So if anything, Moody's will only downgrade by a notch or two from Baa2, and a B rating is 5 notches away, unless there is implication that its economy deteriorates fast enough to warrant greater downgrades."
14318,2016-01-06T01:36:15Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"A second lowering this quickly after the December action is unlikely. Further, looking at the list of countries currently rated B or lower does not convince me that SA is quite in that company yet."
734,2016-01-06T01:35:24Z,1,[3.0],[3.0],Agree with @boz that the question is miscast. Very unlikely that such a precipitous drop would occur in the timeframe that has been given. Likely meant a non-prime rating rather than B status. It will be interesting to see if the question is reformulated in the next few days...
8170,2016-01-06T01:28:10Z,1,[2.0],[2.0],A multiple notch downgrade in such as short period of time would be very unlikely in such a short time frame.

Even with a biggest crisis ever, credit agencies can still lag behind and do not change SA rating. Credit agencies ratings usually are reactive to market prices, not predictive."

915,2016-01-05T21:02:42Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],B is pretty severe. SA is a basket case and will continue to be w/low commodity prices.....but B or lower is unlikely?
3363,2016-01-05T21:00:27Z,1,[7.0],[7.0],"I'd like to think that they meant to ask if South Africa would be downgraded to junk status (plausible, just 2 levels down) and mis-stated the question by asking about a B rating (five levels down). As several commenters noted below, the only way this happens is if the country pulls out of the ratings system or defaults on its debts. There is zero historic precedent for a country losing its rating this quickly unless it defaults."

1529,2016-01-05T20:26:26Z,1,[40.0],[40.0],"Moody's recently downgraded SA rating to Baa2, with a ""stable"" outlook based on referencing SA's commitment to bring forth greater budget constraints."
