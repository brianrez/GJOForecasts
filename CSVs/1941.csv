At times I do not post them all because they may be considered “way out there”. But here is a question I asked myself about the elections this year... Is it better to be a democrat trying to be more conservative or a republican trying to be more liberal? I am leaning towards a republican with liberal social views at present. https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/208704 We can't ignore social mood.

Ohio is a very close swing state, and if turnout from Democrats is high, as would be expected with Trump or Cruz as the Republican presidential nominee, it would seem that the Democrats would have a slight advantage. That said, Portman has some advantage as an incumbent, his approval ratings have been decent, though not great, and he has been very effective at raising money, which may be an indication of strength as a candidate. I give Portman the slight edge at this point as the incumbent."

Portman was recently thanked by the Ohio steel workers for protecting the industry from from foreign influence. Portman is now fighting to protect over 45K union pensions at the federal level. This is the story I will be following closely. Will Portman be able to save these pensions from cuts? I think he will considering his former federal government positions."
