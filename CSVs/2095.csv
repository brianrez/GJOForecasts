The exchange rate hasn't been below 6.3 since its big three day run up in August. Since then the RMB's biggest daily rise was from about 6.47 to a around 6.385 in early September. A quick scouring of the charts shows an average trading day movement since then has been less than a third of that open to close. There has been virtually no movement on any period from late afternoon on Fridays (EST) to Sunday afternoons (EST). Given that it is now 15:25 EST on a Friday there is little reason to think there will be much movement in the next day.

In 10 days, I am estimating that there is only a 11% chance it falls below 6.40. This is based on the (very) few things I know about the yuan / USD exchange rate, namely: (1) The yuan is a ""managed float"" currency. The exchange rate is largely controlled by the Chinese government, and is under-going a managed devaluation to stimulate export growth due to a weakening economy. (2) On Nov 30, the yuan entered the IMF's selective basket of reserve currencies, and the Chinese government has vowed to keep the yuan stable So the question becomes: What is the likelihood of the government to reverse the current devaluation strategy, in the next 10 days, so that the exchange rate falls below 6.40 USD? Frankly, if all my assumptions are right, then it will be even more unlikely than I have estimated here. However, there's still a lot I don't know on this topic, so I've left room to allow for my ignorance."

The renminbi doesn't float freely. In recent times, it would hardly change at all over the course of a year. The exchange rate is manipulated by the Chinese government officials for three contradictory purposes. (1) They want an undervalued currency to promote exports. (2) They aspire to have the renminbi become a reserve currency in the future. (3) They have an internal political imperative to preserve the belief that they have absolute control over everything. Recent information now suggests that the ECB will pursue a looser monetary policy, putting downward pressure on the Euro over time. This will mess up Chinese goal #1 and create pressure for another Chinese devaluation. However, the most recent devaluation episode made them lose face with respect to goals #2 and #3. They also have a potentially dangerous political showdown coming up regarding territorial claims in the South China Sea. They won't want to show weakness with respect to the exchange rate while they are playing the bully role with respect to the first island chain. The only problem here is that 6.36 is on the bubble between two artificial choices. The correct answer is somewhat more likely to be (C) than (B) since that would favor Chinese goal #1"
