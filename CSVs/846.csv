The European Council for and Energy Efficient Economy have declared their request to be invalid and potentially damaging to long-term sustainability and competitiveness of the European car Industry. There have been rollbacks by the EPA in the US and requests to the UK Government for tax breaks and relief on emission regulations. However, the Major German manufacturers VW, Daimler and BMW have stated there is no need to roll-back the requirements that have deflated the argument and so a relaxation or delay of the co2 emission is unlikely. Also, the bureaucratic behemoth that is the EU will not be concerned about the details of a particular department and change will not be sudden."

Europeans are also accepting that our CO2 output needs to be reduced and will oppose changes.
