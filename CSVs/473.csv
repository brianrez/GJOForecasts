He also seems to have found ways to get out his message on other platforms. If he does ask, the date of 8 Jan is too close to the 6 Jan insurrection attempt at the US Capitol for facebook/Instagram to agree. In fact, as September ends and November is around the corner, there are too many opportunities for Facebook/Instagram to say ""it's only been a year"" and there have been limited times where Donald Trump has demonstrated a change in his social media presence/tactics."

If he gets incarcerated, I could see less of an incentive to maintain social media on both sides. However, maybe to Trump this will encourage him to join social media. But then again, there is the risk of him causing a social media rally before being handcuffed away which will freak the moderating teams on the social media platforms and encourage them to maintain birth control. Nonetheless, this scenario is still a low probability event."

I mean it's safer for them to not lift the banned. Third reason : political bias We all know that all the platforms don't mention their political affiliation, and they are pursuing their best effort to be neutral. How do we know Facebook's employees don't side certain politician? We don't know. But they banned of Donald Trump, the president of United states is a strong evident that they have some bias towards Donald Trump. If we'd like to be honest, how many politicians lie and not get banned? They certain have bias towards Trump."
