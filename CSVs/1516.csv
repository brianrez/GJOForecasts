Confirmation of death in the next few weeks therefore very unlikely. - could have fled, probably out of the country - if so, no clear reason why he would voluntarily reappear/announce his whereabouts, particularly before his 20 November trial. As @mwokasch points out, it's not clear that anyone is looking for Kanu so with no effective ongoing search, and no incentive for anyone to reveal existing knowledge of his whereabouts, it looks extremely unlikely he will be ""found"" before 21 November."

Nigerian federal gov. frustration with the EU support of IPOB thought Biafra Radio in the UK and French financial support caused them to declare IPOB a terrorist orginization. The Nigerian gov. had two choices: Finding him guilty of treason and risking a very violent uprising or making him disappear, denying everything, labeling him a terrorist, and hoping to turn a potential violent eruption into more manageable civil unrest. Within the past few days Buhari has been making overtures to attempt to bring the southeast into mainstream politics . It is for that reason he will not be found."
