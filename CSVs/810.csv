There is a rising trend of younger (21-30 y.o.) individuals becoming infected as they are generally less compliant with mask policies and assume they are less likely to become seriously ill, and this may continue to pose a problem; there has been a small spike in reported infections in the last few weeks due to parties held on July 4th. However, these individuals would not be likely to cause daily hospitalizations to reach 1000 again. The only concern is for the coming fall and winter, when flu season and cold weather will drive up infections; many scientists and epidemiologists believe a second wave would hit around this time. However, those hospitalizations would also not be likely to occur until after October, which is beyond the scope of the question."

Regardless, unless protesting grows into a much larger, longer-term moment, I believe this will only create a blip. I choose slightly higher probabilities in Jun-Jul because of these factors, also considering the incubation period. September is low because I believe, based on what I’ve read, that the virus will slows over the summer (partially due to weather, partially do to improved knowledge if how to handle the virus, partially because I don’t expect wide-spread growth of protests, riots, and looting).

So speaking about the rest of genpop (80%), this group is not the same as the first 20% - it will not be as easy to reach and infect these 80%. Plus in addition the these 20%, the virus probably already attempted to infect 5-10% of population but was repelled by their inmate immune system and pre-existing cross-immunity. Summer months will only improve these defense mechanisms temporarily. So in total we might be speaking about 30%+ of population being excluded from any further virus spread. Or ~40%+ of population to exclude if we speak about the effective base (taking into account easiness to reach and to infect those people who can fuel new infections & hospitalization). But 30-40% exclusion is a noticeable blow into how quickly the virus can spread. If the mobility of people would remain as low as it was in April-May then I would predict that 1000 of hospitalizations would be reached not earlier than Mid-December or more likely - NEVER. But a plan for re-opening economy and growth of mobility has unknown yet schedule, pushing this date much earlier. I assume that previous exposure to virus has much higher incidence than confirmed 20% because of the reasons above.

I would feel less confident about this if we were talking about a different municipality, but New York State and New York City have shown a willingness to take broad and decisive action, and I suspect they would be quick to do so well before hospitalizations reached the rate described above. I do believe that CASES will likely surge within this timeframe, to levels at or above previous peak, but I think that will be largely due to increased testing, and perhaps some increase in transmission, but I'm bearish on it translating to a level of acute cases requiring hospitalization above the subject threshold."
