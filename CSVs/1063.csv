This suggests a slightly better result for the PSOE in terms of the popular vote (29.7% vs 28.7%). Because of the regional D'Hondt system, we can't exactly translate the popular vote to seats but I don't have anything else to go on so I've assumed that the result will be a 3.5% increase in the number of seats won. That puts the PSOE on around 127 seats in the upcoming election. As this puts the PSOE on the upper half of the probability brackets I've hedged my bets slightly more towards 132-144 than 108-120. The more extreme brackets seem to be a slim possibility based on my reading of the popular press. The last election was only a few months ago so a collapse of the vote seems unlikely especially as the main right of centre rivals to the PSOE have reportedly lost votes to smaller parties on the right. As the electoral system in Spain benefits larger parties, this should work in favour of the PSOE. I've put 5% in the >144 bracket to cover the chance that voters are tired of a hung parliament that they choose to back the party most likely to win."
