She won in a landslide in 2016 [1], garnering ~56% of the vote in a three-way race (the other candidates received 31% and 13%). She is again in a three-way race [2] and recent polling (there are four polls from the past ten days that reflect this three-way race) has her winning, on average, ~42% of the vote. This is compared to an average of ~25% for Han Kuo-yu and ~8% for James Soong [3]. Also, news has literally just broke that a Chinese spy has defected to Australia and has released a trove of information on China's foreign influence operations - a key target of which has been Taiwan and its upcoming presidential election [4]. This is huge news (as such a defection seems to have never happened before) and it is sure to work in President Ing-wen's favor, as she is seen as more hawkish on China than her opponents. This will likely hurt Kuo-yu, who is second in the polls, since the defector seems to have indicated that China's influence operation has been working to advance his candidacy. And, of course, the ongoing Hong Kong protests probably also help President Ing-wen - but I assume that this is already reflected in the polling since the polling is recent."
