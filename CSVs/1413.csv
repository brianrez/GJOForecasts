In order for the spot Brent to close below the support level of $80 needs to drop more than 3.75% from its highs of $83+ within today and 1st of October. It will be always a possibility whether spot brent trade below or above $80 as the price can move very quickly, so far, it has lately been quieter gaining wider spreads from WTI price. So I have changed my forecast 6 times as the oil prices keep moving, adapting to the new incoming prices and information, oil trading it is a very difficult trade and gets​ it right as there are many moving parts to the equation."

First, the trajectory of Brent crude oil prices indicate that in the remaining trading days between now and 1 October 2018, the spot price will only increase from its current value of $81.85 (https://www.bloomberg.com/energy). Second, the future value of a Brent crude oil contract for November 2018 is priced at $81.81, indicating that prices will remain in excess of $80, with slight fluctuations. (https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/brent%20crude?countrycode=uk) Third, recent developments indicate that the closing spot price for Brent crude oil on 1 October 2018 will be significantly above $80 per barrel. Over the weekend, OPEC leaders refused to increase production of Brent crude oil. (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/24/brent-crude-breaks-80-its-highest-since-2014-as-oil-market-tightens.html) Coupled with sanctions enacted by the United States against Iran, the global supply of oil is predicted to contract, thus increasing the price of oil. (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/24/brent-crude-breaks-80-its-highest-since-2014-as-oil-market-tightens.html) Recent predictions from multinational investment banks, such as JP Morgan, have speculated that the price of Brent crude oil will exceed $90 a barrel in the upcoming months. Therefore, I contend that the spot price of Brent crude oil at closing time on 1 October 2018 will be in excess of $80 a barrel."

The wider geopolitical is what happens if the US repudiates the deal and the other signatories do not? The US has been able to pressurize the world to into putting trade bans and sanctions on countries by threatening to discriminate against countries that don't join with the US. Generally speaking this has been effective when the US is viewed as upholding international law, but has been less effective when the US has been viewed as acting arbitrarily (e.g. against Cuba). If the US moves toward more unilateral solutions to problems will the other big economies start moving further away from coordinating their international policies with the US? Will other countries move to protect their economies from possible future arbitrary US policies by setting up international systems that can bypass the US? Will the post-WW2 international organisations such as the World Bank, IMF, WTO (formerly GATT), UN etc. become clubs of the international countries with the US just left as an isolationist state? For the last 70 years its economy has been big enough relative to everyone else to dominate, but the relative economic power of the US is declining (as it must as other countries improve their economies). The US still dominates in military power, but China sees the need to balance the US. Will the EU seeing a more isolationist US (or if not isolationist, then a unilateralist US) and a growing China, a Russia, India and others, start to see the need to build it defense capabilities to match its economy? The US says it wants Europe to build up its defenses, but it assumes that Europe would continue to be a junior Allies of the US. Would be US be so happy if Europe thought it needed to build up its military power to protect itself from a unilateralist US?"

Opec countries are for example over compliant (https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-opec-production-targets/) and this is not only driven by Venezuela.

It is unlikely to skyrocket even with conflict, and it could fall below 60 per barrel, but that is not very likely barring some radical changes in the way big oil in the states does business. This is one of the few where the company can control the supply by simply shutting down production in order to manipulate the price, which happens in the States quite often, and OPEC doesn't expect to lift production caps until next year which should keep the Brent crude prices stable until at least mid Jan 2019"

OPEC cannot easily control prices (except in the very short term) so I don't think they can get prices much higher and if prices start to slip US drillers will cut back on new wells in order to be profitable.

Shale oil wells can be turned on and off easily too (unlike traditional oil wells that cause damage to well and pipes when left idle for extended periods). This makes it harder for OPEC to actually ""kill"" US shale companies even when they are pressed with lower demand / lower prices...they just increase production again as soon as the price is high enough. I don't see how OPEC can break through that ceiling without a major global political/ strategic event.

OPEC Members Behavior At the moment it looks like all members are keeping their sponsorship agreements, but here is always some risk that some country is cheating. further production reduction is unlikely --> Downside risk 5. Global economy Outlook The outlook stays intact. This is from my point of view largely priced in. But especially chinese data hav potential for upward suprise --> Upside risk 6.

It appears that shale oil US growth will not be enough to meet strong demand growth (will have to watch economic indicators though), since the supply will likely disappoint in countries, such as Brazil, Mexico and particularly Venezuela. This is also aligned with recent statements by Schlumberger on its latest quarterly earnings call when they said that due to large underinvestments globally - i.e. global energy capex has been cut by 40% - production will or is declining in many places. Yes they are biased but they are the biggest in oil services and they still need to be mindful how optimistic they come across to manage expectations. Generally, I see a lot more upside than downside risks to my forecast also due to high scepticism in the market. In the short-term, I see some reasons for a pull back, mainly as refiners begin maintenance season for a few weeks, which may dampen demand technically."
