"Between 1 July 2018 and 30 June 2019, will an armed group from the Philippines engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in the Philippines?",2018-06-27T17:00:15Z,2018-10-01T06:59:15Z,Yes,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],102,654,55,237,"The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (The EWP). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 30 September 2018 and will be resolved in July 2019 after EWP assesses the situation in the Philippines from July 2018 to June 2019. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilians fatalities occur in one or more campaigns. See (EWP) for examples.

According to Human Rights Watch's 'World Report 2018' released in the beginning of this year, President Duterte’s extrajudicial war on drugs that began in June 2016, had resulted in the killing of more than 12,000 drug suspects by the end of 2017 (i.e. 12,000 civilians systematically killed by armed groups - as defined above - over 1.5 years). We do not know if the death toll is continuing at that rate. However, there are factors/developments that can drive a significantly high death rate. In addition to the open-source information shared by cdob63, other media reports in June 2018 indicated that President Rodrigo Duterte (after consulting with the police and intelligence community) said he was considering arming community leaders, known as 'barangay' captains, with handguns. The intention is to mobilise the country's barangay captains to help fight crime and drugs. President Duterte said that he vowed to provide the same legal protection to barangay captains as he did soldiers or police, and they “will never go to jail” if they shot suspected criminals in the performance of their duty. There are currently 42,000 barangay captains in the country. The handguns would be provided for free, or private purchases subsidized. If the Duterte administration implements this policy, we can expect not only more gun-related violence in the Philippines but also the basis for the systematic killing of 1,000 or more civilians in the Philippines."
