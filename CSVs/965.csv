So I assess that an event of this nature could be counted as extremely rare, even during past periods of very high tensions. Further, both sides, and particularly Iran, have developed proxy forces and other levers through which they can conduct misattributable attacks, apply other means of pressure, and message/signal each other. It is my assessment that they would continue to use these means should one of the players desire to kill a member of the other nation's armed forces. Separately, the fact that they do not share any borders reduces, in my assessment, the chances of an accidental conflagration that could lead to a death."

Prior to the Iranian revolution in 1979, relations were convivial, but the establishment of the Shia theocracy created a power struggle between them and the Saudi Wahhabi Sunni branch of Islam. The issues between the two regional centres appear not to be based on religion or culture/language but on Iran’s support of insurgent and radical groups and Saudi’s pivot towards the US and Israel. Both ascertain to be the power centres of the region. Overt conflict between the two has involved proxy wars in the Yemen and Syria, both supporting either side, giving the impression that they are avoiding direct conflict with each other’s armed forces. Covid-19 has severely affected both countries. Saudi has been struck financially by the downturn in oil revenues and Iran by the lack of medical supplies due to sanctions. A question would be if either side would take advantage of the dire distraction of the pandemic and create an incident. On balance I will propose that there is a low probability of a lethal conflict between the armed forces the two countries. 10% probability in case of rogue elements of locally based militia."

But the limitation of it being at sea or in the Iranian territory, makes this less likely even. I would say that Iranian pre election context increases the probability of some external provocation to Iran, but for this to include a killing of a military personnel, I find it not very likely. Trying to put this in numbers, I ask myself “is it more or less than 50% that an Iranian or Saudi army personnel is killed in Iran or at sea?” I would say definitely below 50%. But is it negligible, such as 2%? Perhaps not, more than that. It feels like more than 10% (one in ten chance) and less than 33% (one in three chance). I will start with a 20% probability, although it feels quite high because it would have to (1) be a confirmed confrontation between these two nations (maybe 35-40%), (2) be in Iranian soil or at sea (assign maybe 50% to that), and finally (3) to result in a death (maybe 50% if there is a confrontatiob someone will die). Final multiplicative probability about 40%*50%*50%=10%.my gut feel of 20% against this calculated probability of 10%, I will end with assigning 18% closer to my gut feel."

The attack on the Saudi oil field was possibly in connection with Iran and the late General Soleimani who was assassinated in early January. Soleimani was building militaries in surrounding Middle East countries including Yemen and the Houthis (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtzvIBAYP_8).

Saudi Arabia, despite having the political and military backing (in terms of arms sales, at least) from the US, is concerned about being pulled into conflict with Iran because of US actions. It relies too heavily on the US for defense from Iran and possesses a fraction of arms in comparison to Iran (regardless of how modern these arms may be). In addition, there has been speculation recently (due to comments from diplomatic entities on both sides) on the potential for diplomatic talks to open up between the two rivals. Iran, on the other hand, is operating under a crippled economy and has yet to furnish a nuclear weapon (although it is making strides in completing one sooner rather than later). Additionally, Iran traditionally works through its proxies to carry out attacks against its enemies or opts to target infrastructure (i.e. oil infrastructure) in lieu of personnel. Its recent attack on US bases managed to produce zero US fatalities, an indicator of its willingness to carry out tit-for-tat attacks without prompting a larger, more direct confrontation with the US. Tie all of this information in with the fact that it is an election year in the US Saudi Arabia cannot count on continued, un-compromising support from the US should a progressive Democrat win the nomination. Finally, time is a major factor that I have historically discounted in these scenarios. For a direct, lethal confrontation to break out between the national military forces of either side to occur it would likely happen after an escalation of events that culminated in a ""straw that breaks the camel's back"" event. Current events are showing us that neither side is in a position to carry out a full-scale war against the other and has more to lose than to gain."

Therefore, while at odds in Yemen today and for long time for bigger historical reasons, Iran and Saudis are aligned at this moment to let things cool down until they get sense of where Trump' reelection bid is. If it seems he is about to lose (assuming there is 0% chance of him being removed by Senate) the reelection bid, Iran will want to extract its revenge whiel Saudis will try to bolster him, leading to conflict. If he seems on his way to get reelected then such a conflict is unlikely. Therefore, question is what are the chances polls will show that he is going to lose the electoral college vote in, let's say, September.

Iran's main preoccupation right now seems to be how to pressure the US to get out of Iraq, while the Saudis will be happy for America to be doing the sabre-rattling and drone strikes against targets like Soleimani so they don't have to. 2) will there be lower-level skirmishes that lead to fatalities (what this specific question is asking)? That's not impossible - think of India and Pakistan who occasionally get into shooting matches in Kashmir even without going to war. But it wouldn't be a deliberate choice.
