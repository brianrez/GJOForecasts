In the primary, Dhingra received a majority of the votes cast (51.5%). Despite lots of money pouring in, Englund did poorly (41.5%) although the turnout was very low at (34%). In 2016, Hillary Clinton beat Trump here with 64.8% vs. Trump's 28% with 78% voter turnout. The State Senate has been inching towards Democratic majority and in fact has the numbers except that one Senator caucuses with Republicans giving them the edge. Both (House) Representatives in District 45 are Democrats The current appointed Senator, Dino Rossi is Republican and ran for Governor a couple of times coming very close in 2004. Englund seems to have anti-choice positions and is pinning her hopes on mobilizing people over the state income tax. As Washington doesn't have one, and the state Supreme court ruled it unconstitutional, and there is no bill proposing one, it seems a bit like swinging a sword at windmills. On the other hand, Dhingra seems to prioritize more education funding which the state supreme court has mandated. Trying to focus on Trump may not work too well but issues such as immigration and women's rights may hold sway. Plenty can change between now and November making me hesitate to predict any election but Englund's 41% of the vote is pretty low to bounce back from.. the unforeseen (very predictable in high profile elections) is where I put 5% for Englund for now."
