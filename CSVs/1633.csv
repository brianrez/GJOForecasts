What will be the 2017 industry-wide average cost of Li-ion batteries used in battery-powered electric vehicles?,2017-07-21T17:00:13Z,2018-01-01T18:00:42Z,More than $230 but less than $245 per kWh,"['Less than $215 kWh', 'Between $215 and $230 per kWh, inclusive', 'More than $230 but less than $245 per kWh', '$245 per kWh or more']","['Finance', 'Technology']",404,654,178,237,"This question will be resolved using the Mack Institute's analysis for 2017, which will replicate an approach published in a 2015 Nature Climate Change study. In 2016, using a similar method, the Mack Institute found that the average price had declined to $282 per kWh (Mack Institute). Lowering the cost of battery packs through R&D investments, manufacturing improvements, and economies of scale is a major consideration for bringing down the price of battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs) and making them more competitive with gasoline-fueled internal combustion engines (Bloomberg, The Guardian).

The industry wide 2016 cost is inflated by a BMW who's kWh cost is much higher ($485). The average annual decline in cost has been 16.2% over past 10 years, which would put 2017 avg at $236 per kWh, but I think there is a good chance BMW will have a larger decline in it's cost in order to be competitive in the market."

(Although BMW suggest its new lower cost batteries will not arrive until 2018) There is 230GWh of new battery capacity coming on line. Prices of under $140 KWh are now being quoted. With a lot of new supply, demand may slip behind supply in 2017."
