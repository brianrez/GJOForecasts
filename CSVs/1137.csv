Secondly, 'the EU has a legal duty to all its member states to ensure that any such withdrawal is not damaging to what article 13(1) of the treaty on European Union calls the “consistency, effectiveness and continuity of its policies and actions”, or to the principle spelled out in article 13(2): “Pursuant to the principle of sincere cooperation the EU and the member states shall, in full mutual respect, assist each other in carrying out the tasks which flow from the treaties.”' (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/03/gina-miller-eu-delay-brexit-no-deal). The economic consequences of a hard Brexit will be massive. Consequently, I believe that the EU will grant, if needed, an extension to article 50. As I write, Mr. Bercow is speaking (https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/21/brexit-johnson-to-push-for-deal-as-labour-woos-rebel-tories-eu-extension-live-news) and has just blocked the government's motion. Given Labour's concerns over withdrawal agreement Mr. Johnson has negotiated, and the concerns of the DUP and others, and the vast chasm between the opposition and the government on matters related to a custom's union and a confirmatory referendum, the EU will likely have to grant an extension. In the least, there is so little time left to get on with it. There is no majority for a second referendum as things stand. Mr. Johnson cannot achieve Brexit without an election, but, as recent polling indicates, he is unlikely to win an election without Brexit (https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/boris-johnson-will-only-win-a-general-election-if-brexit-is-delivered-by-31-october-poll-suggests/ar-AAICVfG), so his endgame is Brexit, deal or no deal. Yet, a ""People v Parliament"" election (https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnson-lays-ground-for-people-v-politicians-general-election-tf9v7nkg5) could win him a majority, in my mind, and he may gamble that he has done enough to hurt the Brexit Party and his messaging and the manner in which he asked for an extension of article 50, suggest that that is his thinking (https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/18/boris-johnson-charms-parliament-brexit-election-050700) and he will call for a general election to Get Brexit Done."

Then a public vote of on the WA and the FTR. Then (if the public agreed) an implementation period started. This is more or less what the sequence that was supposed be. All I have added is the Public Vote and that what was called the Future Framework is worked up into a legal text. The reason for adding the Public Vote is that the 2016 referendum was a vote to change the UK relationship to the EU, without clarity on what relationship the public wanted. The reason for making the FTR a legal document is that without legal certainty the public can't be sure where the UK relationship will finish up. (With BJ as PM many are suspicious that the FTA will not be agreed because many Conservative Breiteers prefer what the Brexit Party wants, and the BJ deal is just a means of getting there.) The reason for starting the implementation period after both the WA and FTR become law, is that until the final destination has being agreed its not possible to start implementing it."

The EU may delay in confirming an extension but are unlikely to deny one outright as they do not want to be seen to be forcing the UK out and if a few extra days or weeks are required to allow the legislation to pass in the UK that is not going to hurt the EU. It is unlikely that the UK would be ready to leave before 31 Oct and likely that the EU would have granted an extension by then even if it ultimately turns out to not be needed. So extension seems most likely to happen first.

Tomorrow it will hold its first Saturday session since the Falklands War in 1982 to put the deal into British law. But the parliamentary arithmetic is forbidding. The ten-strong Democratic Unionist Party has already declared its opposition to the revised agreement. The hardline European Research Group looks, with one or two exceptions, likely to vote in favour. But Boris Johnson, the prime minister, would still need to win over 21 Conservative MPs who have lost the whip and a significant number of Labour MPs in leave-voting constituencies to get his bill through. Labour looks as if it will try to scupper it. Mr Johnson’s best chance of getting over the line is to confront MPs with a clear choice between this deal and no deal.“"

Most of the expelled Tories are expected to vote with the government. It will most likely come down to Labour and how many of them vote with the government. This will be interesting, as Corbyn says they can't accept the deal but there are several MPs who voted with the government on the last deal and others who are very pro-Brexit and/or from strongly Brexit areas who may vote for the deal.

Maybe they will change their minds, but if the WA is as described in the media it would create a big problem for the DUP. It might be thought that as the DUP is a party in favour of Brexit it would be keen to agree BJ's deal, but that ignores what the point of the DUP is. Without going back into Irish history its necessary to understand what the DUP's raison d'etre is. Its underlying purpose was to stop what their supporters saw as the risk of Irish Protestants being overwhelmed by Irish Catholics. The Protestants saw themselves as British, the Catholics were seen as Irish Popests. Before the 1960s the NI Protestants controlled the NI government, police and business, but the 1960s saw the rise of protest movements in many countries where communities who felt they were being denied civil rights started agitating for their civil rights. When you increase the civil rights of one group the previously dominant group if usually not happy. So the DUP raison d'etre is to stop NI becoming like Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement recognized this and gave both the Protestants and Catholics vetos on changes. As far as I can understand the issue with the BJ WA is what exactly ""a change"" is. Most people in NI would see ""a change"" as being something that alters the current arrangement between NI and Ireland. The DUP sees ""a change"" as something that alters the current arrangement between NI and GB. Logically if GB itself changes (by not being in the EU and having some as yet unknown trading relationship) but NI remains aligned with Ireland and the EU, then a future change in NI to remove this alignment with the EU, this change ought to be agreed by both communities. As the majority of voters in NI were not in favour of Brexit, it seems unlikely that there would be cross community consensus for NI to change what (I assume) is in the BJ WA. So the DUP would see NI's economy becoming more integrated with Ireland's and less like GB's. The inconvenience of the paper work and duties paid and maybe refunded required for NI/GB trade compared to frictionless trade between NI and Ireland (and the EU) would be certain to gradually mean NI become more like Ireland (and probable eventually lead to a united Ireland. So for the DUP the long term affect of voting for BJ's WA could make the party irrelevant."

The Benn Act requires not just that the UK agrees in principal to a WA, but that ""a Deal"" has been voted thru the UK Parliament. As the deal between Mrs May and EU ran to over 600 pages, (and was very difficult to read because lots of sections required that the reader read other legal documents in order to understand variations to them that the WA would entail). I can't see MPs voting on such an important document that they (or their legal advisors) have not had time to read, and that they have not had time to discuss with their constituents, by 19th Oct. Its possible that if BJ requests an Extension to A50 as required by the Benn Act, that the EU could delay replying to the request until they have a clear idea what the UK would use the extension for. For example they might delay replying in order to see if the UK Parliament will vote for it before the 31st Oct. If the extension had been requested but the UK Parliament then voted thru a WA, then the Extension would (probably) not happen."

If, as expected, Britain holds an election later this year, it will not win many seats. Yet it could easily determine the outcome. Mr Farage’s ultra-hard line on Brexit (he says “no deal” is the only acceptable outcome) is enough to tempt some voters away from the Tories. If Britain’s exit is delayed again next month, as seems likely, still more will defect, potentially costing the Tories the marginal seats needed for a majority. The need to out-Farage Mr Farage helps explain both why the Tories chose Boris Johnson as their leader and why Mr Johnson is using an ever-more populist tone.

The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, has promised that instead of the normal prime minister’s question time today MPs will have “full scope” for urgent questions and ministerial statements. One opposition party, the SNP, has demanded a vote of no-confidence in the government; other parties may follow suit. If the government loses, that would trigger a general election—which is what Mr Johnson has been seeking all along.”"

Meanwhile, the opposition parties are determined to keep the Conservatives in government until November, having passed a law requiring the government to seek a Brexit extension. This means that Johnson's options are likely to be a) no-deal Brexit (now illegal); b) seek an extension (political suicide in the forthcoming election); or c) resignation (a humiliating end to his political career). I suspect that, as a natural risk-taker, he may well opt for a no-deal Brexit, at which point it will be up to the Conservative Parliamentary Party to decide quickly whether to demand his resignation in the knowledge that it would likely destroy their electoral prospects, or be complicit in breaking the law.

However, I think if the EU refused an extension, Parliament is more likely to revoke Article 50 than agree to no deal. Hard to see May's deal making a comeback, but not impossible. General election seems quite likely in due course as Johnson unlikely to get a Queen's speech through but others lack support to form a government - but with a Queen's speech on Oct 14 and voting several days later, and 14 days allowed following a no confidence vote before an election has to be called, it may not quite happen before Nov 1, so other action needs to come first - but things could change if the court rules against prorogation (I think this is unlikely). Referendum also reasonably likely in due course, but probably not to be settled before other things have to happen."

Most likely is 'no deal' because of the inherent weakness of the negotiating stance combined with the govt's inflexibility. The 2018 agreement has been rejected too many times to be viable. A new agreement is possible but it's a little late for one, so it's very unlikely, a delay is far more likely. The only viable circumstances I can see where the Commons might accept an election would be if Boris guarantees a pre-Brexit election date, but he has no reason to do this as he already has what he wants (i.e. Brexit, regardless). Even if he did, Parliament is no longer sitting, so an election isn't practical. This is as high as 8% because this possibility is still in play, and actively being mentioned by the PM, also the EU may demand that a (post Brexit) election date is set as part of a prerequisite to a deal, meaning it would probably be announced before any deal. However, this would likely be seen as interference, so is unlikely. There may be technical reasons for Revoking Article 51 as part of a negotiated agreement or if it were to be replaced by a replacement law as part of a delay - another reason for this possibility is an outside chance of political shock as the environment is very volatile."

The bill that is now going through the Lords should receive Royal Assent on Monday and would force BJ to ask for an extension if no WA is agreed by parliament by 19 October (or parliament had agreed to a no-deal Brexit which is very unlikely)."

Currently, to distract the public from Mr. Corbyn's Salford pronouncement that a non-confidence motion may happen tomorrow, Mr. Johnson muses about calling an election. Very clever: Corbyn is less likely to act this week if it may be seen as on Johnson's prerogative. It's the British version of flip-flop tweeting. Maintaining the absence of rational thought appears to be key strategy: gain fame for messing your hair and making inane noises when cornered on TV, or throw out packages of paper towel at a hurricane disaster relief meeting, but avoid getting serious at all costs. In the absence of sincere governance I'm upping the probability of chaotic no-deal exit to two sides of the die. And, if an election is called before September 12th, then Mr. Johnson will do all in his power to set the date without consulting the EU first. (If nothing happens by September 12th - except rhetoric - then the question will still be open and two weeks of poor forecasting will not affect results much!)"

If the no-confidence vote fails, or they can't form the interim government, then the no-deal scenario becomes the most likely. Why would the no-confidence vote fail? I'd think it hinges mostly on Labour's calculus for their prospects in an election? If they expect to lose seats to the Lib Dems, and votes to Farage or even the Tories, will Corbyn be eager for an election? This suggests though that they will take the chance, to stop no-deal: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/29/polls-labour-election-victory-yougov-tories-tactical-voting.

In which case, the date will be set, in fact the election held, before October, 31. If Boris Johnson survives a no-confidence vote (I can't find any good projections on that), then aided by the suspension and need for 25 day campaign, the opposition will be powerless to stop the no-deal exit, with no election. But I put that at just 5%. (Assuming that Tory deectors will support the no-confidence before another Parliamentary take-over that both leaves Boris in place and extends the deadline, with EU agreement. In fact, it's not clear that's even possible without government consent.) I put a new negotiated deal at just 2%, though have doubts whether that should be higher. Maybe the threat of a crash-out will push the EU to make concessions on the back-stop; though my sense is that Ireland will veto that, and insist on the negotiated deal as it is, with the back-stop, or nothing.

A majority of MPs, including a chunk of the prime minister’s own Conservatives, disagree and want to stop no-deal. But they do not agree over how. Labour’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has invited other party leaders to a meeting today to discuss the next steps, including the right time to propose a vote of no confidence in Mr Johnson’s government. But Tories who oppose a no-deal Brexit refuse to attend, saying they cannot support any move that risks putting Mr Corbyn into Downing Street. They prefer to repeat a gambit tried in March, when MPs seized the parliamentary agenda and legislated to require the government to seek an extension of the Brexit deadline. Yet it is not clear in the time left that this plan will succeed. So although most MPs may oppose no-deal, the chances of its happening are rising.“"

No parliamentary majority for any other alternative or it would have happened. Red Corbyn wants an election before Brexit. Bojo wants one where he can have a clear path to a real majority. Based on the EU elections where Brexit party over performed and Conservatives were trounced, that coalition of Conservative and Brexit will win a majority. Those true believers will be able to run an effective campaign and take the steps necessary to implement Brexit. And in 5 years UK will be growing again. EU will never back out of backstop.

The goal of Brexit, as with the goal of Russia's obvious US disunity and election manipulation campaigns, is to make the Russian Ruble the benchmark currency of Europe and the World. The only defense that might arise at this point to save the West from near or actual collapse will be the Russian Money Hoarders deciding to accept that they will be richer if the dollar stays around.

They just cannot agree how. Jeremy Corbyn, the left-wing Labour leader, has offered to head a caretaker government. It would delay Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union and trigger a general election, with his party committed to supporting a second referendum. Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, rules out working with Mr Corbyn because he could not win over wavering Conservative MPs. They dislike no-deal, but hate the idea of Mr Corbyn in Downing Street, however briefly, even more. For those trying to ward off a disorderly exit, revealing the flaws of a “government of national unity” early on may be a good thing. Plotting aides suggest MPs should rally around a simpler scheme: compelling the executive to postpone withdrawal via legislation, rather than bringing the government down. With Prime Minister Boris Johnson committed to dragging Britain out of the bloc on October 31st regardless, time is pressing.“"

A majority of MPs are against no-deal, but Mr Johnson insists Brexit must happen on October 31st, “do or die”. Both UK and EU law now fix that date for Brexit, after a seven-month extension of the original deadline was agreed in the spring. A new report from the Institute for Government, a think-tank, says MPs are running out of options and time to stop a no-deal Brexit. The government reckons that it can block any efforts to pass legislation calling for another extension of the deadline. Even if Parliament passes a vote of no confidence in Mr Johnson next month, as MPs from several parties hope, Downing Street believes it can defer the general election that should follow until after Brexit has happened. Just 79 days are left until October 31st.“"

Cummings (Johnson's advisor) is spreading a lot of misinformation. Presumably he is trying to provoke MPs into having a vote of No Confidence in Johnson in order to blame them for Johnson not delivering Brexit by the end of October. If a No Confidence vote is lost by the PM either Parliament will be able to find another PM who will Extend A50 (so that will be the first thing to happen) or it will lead to a GE, before or after the end of Oct. If the UK is heading for a GE either A50 is Extended first or the Date of the GE is set first. Leaving the EU without a Deal (No Deal) would only occur first if Parliament failed to win a No Confidence vote (i.e. did not hold a vote or Johnson won the vote) and Johnson allowed the UK to Leave the EU without any other action. I think Johnson is bluffing and would not want to Leave the EU on No Deal terms because while the Conservatives might reduce the attraction to (some) voters of the Brexit Party (and hope to pick up votes) a GE would probably be needed anyway (due to lack of Conservative MPs). A GE after a NO Deal Brexit is unlikely to go well for the Conservatives because while many voters say they support No Deal no one really knows how much much disruption No Deal would cause, but is seems fairly certain that some voters will find they are seriously negatively affected and its very unlikely that any voters will find that their lives have improved. In these circumstances it would be easy and logical of many voters to blame the Party and person that caused the problem and not vote for them."

However: The non-confidence route will include GB's leader having to ask for an extension to A50. Anticipating EU will accept with a sigh; say 75/25 the A50 period is extended before the election date is set. (i.e., 10.42% election) The referendum route will include GB's leader having to ask for an extension to A50. Anticipating EU will most likely accept with a sigh but may also say, no, revoke first; say 90% that the EU arrangement is made before a date is set for the referendum; 80/20 the EU agree to an extension and 100% GB revokes, if required. That gives 4.2% for a date for referendum set and 7.5% for GB revoking. Rounding off scientifically, ignoring the first two buckets and using GJ to calculate the remainder gives 61% for extending A50. (90% of editorializing withheld, with difficulty)"

Few-to-none want that. This option arises if a collective stubbornness/exhaustion grows against doing ""anything"" - and thus taking the Default Option (hard Brexit). Incidentally, since ""no one"" signed up for this option (""it chose itself""), ""no one"" becomes responsible for the consequences. That sounds very au courant upon consideration.... 4. Revoking Article 50 and returning to the EU membership, saying ""Never mind"" to the world, seems fanciful. 5. Extending Article 50 past 2019 seems the most likely - since the Europeans don't want the UK to leave - thus establishing precedent for Italy or Hungary to be next. And the re-imposition of borders in Ulster is a guardrail against a o'er hasty Out. 6.A new general election would set in motion a hard Brexit by the Europeans out of their disgust. Borders in Northern Ireland would be re-established. I read there is fear of Labor getting in, and a resulting minority government----from the frying pan and now into the fire. Not to mention the general level of disgust held by the populace for this whole 3-year drama. They would see ""nothing gained"" in another vote for anything (other than for local constable maybe). 7. A new referendum? Are you sure? That would just increase the odds of a hard Brexit as time ""runs out"", and the Europeans move ahead and just fire the Brits."

The Schleswig-Holstein Question is a great corollary for Brexit: the answer to both is 42, i.e., beyond the realm of logical analysis; or 666. Approaching the issue (and the question) as the Devil’s work may help untangle the “catch-22”s in the plot: 22.1: Only BoJo would want an election. (The polls do not look good for Labour and the odds are low for an Alliance Government.) However if BoJo moves to precipitate an election (confidence motion or fan-dangling a non-confidence motion) he may well not get the mandate from Parliament. Meanwhile, Corbyn would (or should) only want an election as a last resort to derail Brexit as defined currently. If he initiates a non-confidence motion he may well succeed. 22.2: If there is non-confidence and we move on to an election it is unlikely that a new government will be formed before Halloween (October 31st). “The Right Thing” would be for the acting PM to request an extension to A50 and for EU to accept, with a sigh. But: BoJo may not Do the Right Thing, or some EU country may be having a bad day and say No. 22.3: Anticipating a motion for another, more specific referendum: BoJo may vote against it, preferring an election - but the DUP may break ranks and carry the motion. Thanks to @Emil @cafebedouin @Anneinak and others for clarifying that the referendum date would be set only after deliberation on the question. In all probability the EU will be asked for extension during this time, and again they will likely accept with a sigh. However, they may demand the question and the date first, depending on when the request is made, and they may say No; revoke first (!) 22.4: BoJo’s posturing about re-negotiation is a sham, and may be a delaying tactic to stall the discouraging but necessary agreements for a well-managed hard exit. If no referendum or election is called first, then there may be an extension towards the end of October to finalize the details. Will the details constitute a “new Withdrawal Agreement”? If so, would they require a vote in Parliament (yes) and would the motion be carried (no). Return to 22.1 and 22.3 with BoJo not looking so good. 22.5: The Conventions: (really! This is no time for navel-gazing.) Will Corbyn make it through to October? Either way, return to 22.4 with Labour resolve for a non-confidence motion in October if Conservatives do not agree to another referendum. 22.6: There are other options, none good. Recalculating: - Give the Devil a 1/6 roll of the dice (dropping out without substantive agreements on security or trade); would increase in late September - No existing or new agreement likely - For the rest: 50% election; 50% referendum, with referendum split 2/1 towards getting EU endorsement before finalizing the date; all subject to Conservative approval ratings this summer, and to my understanding Parliamentary procedure better. Can anyone confirm to me that the Leader of the Opposition may put forward a motion for another referendum any time Parliament is in session, and that there is time for debate before Oct 31?"

On this day in October MPs could vote to block No Deal. The other idea would be to get Corbyn to call for a No Confidence vote (probably in October) and without voting No Confidence an amendment could be attached say that MPs had confidence only if No Deal did not happen.

If the Labour Party's preferred option is to try to get a date set for a General Election their window of opportunity is very small. Presumably Labour would demand a vote of confidence in whoever is the next PM. They can't do that before 4th Sep, (I assume a vote of No Confidence in Mrs May would be pointless because she has already said she is resigning) because the process for forcing a General election requires two No Confidence votes two weeks apart and Parliament will be closed from 25 July to 3 Sept (Mrs May is expected to remain PM until 23 July). In September Parliament will only be in session between 4 Sep and 12 Sep, it them closes for the Party Conferences and reopens on 7 Oct (I think). If the first Confidence vote had already been lost by then the second vote could take place in that week, and then a General Election could be called it is assumed (no one seems to have tested the assumption) that a General Election requires a notice period of at least 6 weeks. So it appears virtually impossible for a General Election to take place before 31st Oct. In theory a PM who had just lost two No Confidence Votes could ask the EU to extend A50 to allow a General Election to be held after 31 Oct, but clearly a Conservative PM who had just lost Parliaments Confidence but had the option of extending A50 or allowing a No Deal Brexit to happen would be under a lot of pressure to let No Deal happen. Obviously if its already too late to have a General Election before 31 Oct, calling for a vote of No Confidence would not be a useful tactic to prevent a No Deal Brexit happening on 31 Oct. It would probably be easier for a Parliament that wanted to block a No Deal Brexit to pass legislation demanding the PM ask for an A50 extension than try to force a General Election."

The MP says Johnson has assured him that the WA will not be renegotiated, it will merely have a few words added to the Backstop section, which the MP considered too small a change to count as renegotiation. While the studio guests argue if this is or is not renegotiation, a tweet is sent by Steve Baker who is also a Johnson for PM supporter to say that he has been promised, by Johnson, several other changes to the WA in particular that the European Court of Justice will not have any role during the 2 year implementation period. It seems likely that Johnson is promising different things to each MP that will vote for him to be PM. So now travel forward a few weeks and Johnson is PM and he goes to the EU (and lets assume they agree to discuss the WA) does he say ""I don't need to renegotiate the WA I just need a one line change to the Backstop""? My guess is that either the EU just say ""No"" or they say ""if we agree this one line change can you guarantee you can get it thru Parliament?"" If Johnson says ""yes"" and the EU agree to the change, but then Baker and ERG (Conservatives) refuse to vote for it because they demand more changes, the EU wil tell Johnson to take a hike. If Johnson says ""No"" the EU will certainly tell Johnson to take a hike. As the EU is as capable as I am of watching BBC TV they already know that Johnson is telling different supporters different things and that what ever he asked for from the EU will be rejected by at least some Conservative MPs (and almost all non-Conservative MPs) so nothing short of full renegotiation of WA with nothing hidden so no last minute surprises arise, will produce a WA that Parliament will vote thru, and that WA would need cross party support not rely on just the Conservative Party MPs and DUP MPs. It would only take a handful of Conservatives to block any version of a WA as too hard or too soft (especially likely with Johnson as PM). There is not time to do a complete renegotiation of the WA before November even if the EU wanted to. To pretend otherwise is setting things up for a certain failure. So as far as I am concerned Johnson might as well be written off now because his statement that agreeing the WA is feasible before November can only happen if he has a way of getting Parliament to vote for Mrs Mays's WA."

Considering that one of the strong reasons for voting in the UK EU Referendum to Leave the EU was because the UK was culturally different to the rest of Europe, its interesting that the EU Parliamentary Elections appear to show that UK voters changes in political views since the last EU election are almost exactly the same as the EU average change in voting. The centre right and centre left lost votes, the Liberal Democrats and Greens gained votes as did the more extreme Nationalist. As far as this question is concerned I don't detect any signs that the EU's views on a Brexit agreement will be substantially different to the views of the old EU Parliament.

However Britain remains wholly divided on all other aspects of Brexit and there is no momentum in any direction. Parliament will likely have to ratify any decision before 31 October and “no deal” does not command a parliamentary majority. There is no reason to believe that the EU will be open to a major renegotiation of the Withdrawal Agreement, but minor tweaks are possible. This would might be viewed as a renegotiated version for the purpose of this question. The Brexit preparation process is more or less on hold, as a successor as PM is being identified. Therefore the most likely scenario is that Britain will remain unable to act at the end of October and ask for a further extension. In any event, this question would have to be asked before the deadline expedites. And hence it would be asked before any of the exit events take place. A referendum or general election would require an extension of the deadlines allow for the preparation which is asked for first ... the decision to ask for a GE or R would likely precede a notice to the EU that an extension is necessary. A GE doesn’t seem wise for either of the parties commanding the strongest position in Parliament. There has not been a parliamentary majority in favour of any form of second referendum."

Corbyn is now committed to not doing anything without a second referendum. Cons most likely will not agree to a referendum. Most Cons will agree to a hard exit or towing the line. A non-confidence motion would see a few Cons and DUP vote their conscience, given that it would be a vote on Brexit - say there is a NN% chance govt would be defeated. This probability will vary over time, and the higher it is perceived by the Cons leader the more likely he/she will agree to intervene with a referendum. Call this probability RR%. To make things easy let's say the leader perceives NN accurately; also, that RR = NN. The Extend A50 bucket forecast relates to procedure and GJ's interpretation of the question (formality of the action vs. confirmed intent): divide RR% equally between Referendum and A50, say. The hard exit bucket does not include the 'chaos' possibility of the non-confidence vote being after mid October. This also assumes there will be no meaningful negotiation with EU to be shot down in Parliament, or extension of A50 without a plan. The forecast is highly sensitive to NN.

Not all candidates for Tory leadership want a no deal Brexit and the current parliament are not likely to vote for one, so chances of this happening are still fairly low but could happen by default if no other action is taken in the meantime.

That move, however, will likely create instability in the country and the government, and so a general election will soon follow. So that's the scenario will the highest probability I think (no deal exit then general election). On the other hand, Boris could get cold feet about a no deal with a strong mandate, and so he could call a general election to seek a mandate for a hard or no deal Brexit. That would probably entail extending the Article 50 period for another 6 months or so."
