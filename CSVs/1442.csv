The most probable/foreseeable is (a) stalemate of negotiations on the Dispute Resolutions chapters of the Agreement, and (b) intervention by Executive Order before expiry of the pre-established timeline for negotiation. Either condition would, in normal circumstances, be highly unlikely, but these are not normal circumstances: (a) the clauses of Chapters 4, 19 and 20 related to multilateral resolution methods were established to ensure non-abuse by a single party (the one with the strongest leverage). The US has stated that multilateral resolution processes undermine its sovereignty and removal is non-negotiable. Mexico has acquiesced. Canada has stated that multilateral resolution is mandatory to protect its interests. It will take elegant negotiation at the presidential/prime ministerial level for this to be resolved - something which I have difficulty picturing within the timeframe (b) political pressure to reverse declining approval ratings, together with repeated declamation of the Agreement, and personal traits for action and to avoid nuance, all add to the probability of a pre-emptive Executive Order.

Also, @dsarin and @Censusguyz, for your recent comments. In my few months of forecasting I've learned the hard way to weigh (a) the uncertainty of the GJ evaluation criteria, (b) the uncertainty of the metric used, and then (c) the probability and uncertainty of the event. Here I see veteran forecasters assessing from zero to 97% for this event. The question seems clear - will the US issue notice under Article 2205. It is unlikely that Mexico will. The US or Canada may, should either country chose to up the anti in brinkmanship (which could be cancelled, potentially), or a leader simply want to make a political statement. However, all signals are that the negotiating teams are acting in good faith and have the intellect and patience to get amendments to the deal right. It also makes sense that any re-branding would be by amendment rather than replacement of the agreement. A meaningful agreement is as significant to economies of the three countries involved as it was when created in the Reagan era - possibly more so with the current risk of a receding middle class of income earners, consumers and tax-base. That said, there may uncertainties related to: 1. a risk of failure of any negotiation, despite the best of intentions of all parties 2. political priorities of the US government in the month or two prior to mid-term elections 3. if Article 2205 can be filed by Presidential Order, then political priorities of the US Executive. (Can any forecaster clarify whether this is possible?) For this question I am indulging my biases now that the clock is nearly up! But there appears to be considerable uncertainty as long as the question remains open."

The Liberals haven’t managed to get anything done in their first mandate aside from marijuana legalisation. Liberals are aiming for status quo. Part of this is appeasing 10,000 dairy farmers in Quebec (a Francophone province with outsized influence politically). Those 10,000 dairy farmers are part of “supply management” which is basically communist dictated supply which costs the average Canadian $300 more for dairy each year. The government is supporting them for the votes (self preservation to stay in power) but arguing its about producing/consuming locally (bad argument given USA dairy farms are closer to non-Quebec customers). The Canadian government is stirring up anti-American sentiment over NAFTA. The Liberals seem willing to sacrifice 160,000 Canadian autoworkers (none in Quebec) for 10,000 Quebec dairy farmers and their Francophone votes. Trump isn’t giving in - he rightfully wants some opening on agriculture. He may be going about it in a typically bellicose manner. Trudeau (Canada) isn’t giving in - he wants those votes. He has proven ability to waste billions for some votes (numerous examples). The Canadians are more subtle in their government messaging and propaganda. Hey Trudeau if you really cared about environment like you say, you’d drop dairy supply mgmt and make people aware it’s bad for the environment and health of your voters. Say what you will about Trump - and I admit there’s lots to say - but he’s fairly transparent on trade. Bravo Mexico. Failing grade Canada."

Trump left open the possibility of cutting Canada out of the final deal, which he said would replace NAFTA. But U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer told reporters later that every effort would be made to include Canada, even if it took weeks or longer for them to sign on to changes. And Mexican leaders also said Canada must be included in the deal. There were also signs of division about what the agreement means for NAFTA. Trump said that the new deal with Mexico would lead to the termination of NAFTA and that he would rename it the United States — Mexico trade agreement. Lighthizer cautioned that no decision had been made about this. Lighthizer said the White House planned to send Congress a letter by Friday that formally starts a 90-day process for changing NAFTA. He said it was still unclear what precisely the letter might say. It could say the U.S. has reached a deal with Mexico, he said, or it could say that an agreement has been reached with Mexico in the hopes that Canada would be brought into the package at a later date. And there were fundamental questions marks about the role of Canada and the future of a regional trade agreement. Peña Nieto, speaking with the president on speaker phone, mentioned several times that he wanted Canada to be involved. Marcelo Ebrard, who has been chosen as Foreign Minister in the new Mexican administration, also said in a statement that while the agreement was a “positive step” Canada was “indispensable for being able to renew the treaty.” ...The surprising scenes of Trump and the Mexican president congratulating each other in front of news cameras on successful bilateral negotiations that left Canada out appeared designed, in part, to pressure Canada. Peña Nieto wrote on Twitter that he has spoken with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and expressed the “importance of rejoining the process, with the goal of concluding the trilateral negotiation this week.” Peña Nieto’s administration wants to reach an agreement soon so that the Mexican Congress has enough time to ratify the deal before President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador takes office on Dec. 1. ...Leading congressional Republicans cautiously welcomed Trump’s announcement, while making clear that they would not embrace a NAFTA 2.0 that leaves out Canada. “A final agreement should include Canada” in order to ensure that NAFTA continues to benefit American businesses and families, said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah). ...Although trade deals are complex affairs that typically require years of glacial bargaining, administration officials initially hoped to finish the job by the end of 2017. They failed to meet that ambitious timetable and also blew through revised deadlines for the end of March and late May. This time, the deadline may be real, given a congressional requirement for 90 days notice of an impending trade deal. If the administration doesn’t formally notify Congress that it has reached agreement with both Canada and Mexico by the end of August, Peña Nieto, the outgoing Mexican president, will not be able to sign it."

On balance, I think the chance of a notice increases somewhat. The tariffs are going to spoil further the not-so-good climate at the NAFTA talks, and reduce the likelihood of completing these talks before the Mexican elections on July 1. Assuming that these are won by the leftist AMLO, will the current Mexican administration even dare to bring a revised NAFTA deal to their Congress in the interim period before the new President gets into office on December 1? I doubt. Sure, it may be possible to conclude a deal that exempts Canada and Mexico from the steel/aluminum tariffs in exchange for concessions on their part. But ratification will probably have to wait the new President of Mexico. Meanwhile, Trump may get impatient and issue the notice to apply pressure. Also, he probably thinks it's a political winner, as it may energize his base for the mid-terms. All in all, still a notice is not very likely - but it's more likely than before the tariffs."

Leaving aside Trump's reported ""enthusiasm"" for the deal, it looks like there would be a serious attempt to resolve the main issues in a freshly-scheduled 8th round of talks in DC in April. The Mexican officials also appear to want this, perhaps scared of the persistent lead of the leftist AMLO in the presidential elections' opinion polls. (I suppose they hope that if the issues are closed, AMLO may choose not to reopen them, while if the negotiations continue, his pre-election rhetorics may force him to take a harder stand.) For a deal ""in principle"" to be reached in April, Mexico and Canada would have to be very flexible, which may indeed be the case if Trump's recent actions scared them. But it won't be easy - I give the deal a chance of some 60%. In any event, a deal in April all but removes the need of a notice. A ""no deal"" scenario is much more uncertain - if good progress will have been achieved, Trump may wait the Mexican elections out; otherwise, the use of the notice as a pressure tool is not dead yet."

Now that it's clear that Canada and Mexico are excluded from the steel & aluminum tariffs, let's think what might be the impact of the tariff saga on the outcome of this question. Trump threatened to impose these tariffs on the US NAFTA partners if no NAFTA deal to his liking is reached - and then backed off. How to read this? On the one hand, Trump did show that he is willing to break - or at least make more costly - established free-trade links. On the other hand, he backed off somewhat under pressure from free-trade Republicans. One way to read this is that Mexico and Canada have to show some more flexibility in the NAFTA talks - to give Trump some victories to ward off bigger disasters. If they go this way, the chance of a notice to withdraw declines. On the other hand, Mexico and Canada may feel emboldened by the support they received from most of the American political class in the tariff discussion and refuse to give in on the substantial issues. This would increase the chance of a notice - as a pressure instrument if nothing more. On the third hand, Trump showed once again his negotiating tactics - throw a big bomb first, alarm everybody, and then scale down the actual policy action. It's not inconceivable he may do the same with a notice to withdraw. But timing would be important here - if it's clear that the NAFTA talks cannot be finished on the original schedule and have to continue after the Mexican elections, will Trump issue the notice before the talks are finished? I think not - such a notice is not a vote-gainer for the Republican party overall (it may energize the anti-trade base, but will repel the business groups, and many Democrats are anti-trade as well). On balance, I still think the most likely scenario is that NAFTA talks continue through October 1 (and probably into 2019, after the new Mexican administration gets into office on Dec 1). But there is a chance that a notice is issued before the deadline, and this chance seems slightly larger than before the tariff episode."

However, his recent plan to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum is likely to start a trade war and demonstrates his weak understanding of the consequences of drastic trade policy decisions. Given this, I'd say it's certainly possible that the U.S. provides notice of intent to withdraw by October.

Trump obviously is intent on bring back profit to the United States and has always stated how much of a ""amazing businessman"" he his to create better deals, but due to the ongoing events that are happening throughout the rest of the world, I don't see why Trump would have an urge to act on the NAFTA question anytime soon. His advisors and cabinet members are a lot of things, but they also are smart enough to know that if for whatever reason there does need to be a pull out of NAFTA, timing is everything. Until the United States is at an economic level of comfort and security would Trump start toying with the idea of withdrawing. The United States, Canada, and Mexico are already incredibly intertwined within one another, all arenas: political, economic, military, and diplomatic, would have to be within perfect balance of one another for the US to withdraw. Mexico is also currently undergoing an election year and the Trump administration wants no involvement of it whatsoever, thus, NAFTA and the idea of withdrawing, can wait."

49298,2018-02-27T01:08:44Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],"I am forecasting 15% yes for this question because in my opinion the odds of the US providing notice of intent before 1 October 2018 are relatively low due to the unpopularity of this proposal. It puts thousands of American jobs in jeopardy and many trade experts agree it is not in the best interests of the US. Additionally, Trump alone cannot withdraw the US from NAFTA; given the nature of US domestic politics, this caveat makes notice of withdraw even more unlikely. However, a few upcoming events may cause Trump to become impatient and push to withdraw in the next few months. The current round of negotiations is supposed to end in March, and unless negotiations are completed by then or there is significant progress unanimously supported by the US, Mexico, and Canada, it will be difficult to implement reforms. Mexican presidential campaigns begin in March and elections will be held in July, during which time Mexico has said it will not ratify a new agreement. If the current political front-runner is elected, Mexico will likely adopt a stronger stance against Trump on trade. Additionally, notice of intent could be used by the Trump administration as a bargaining chip in negotiations to push concessions from Mexico and Canada. For these reasons, it is unlikely, but not impossible, that the US will provide notice of intent to withdraw from NAFTA in the next seven months."

In the lead-up, both trade observers and markets careened from despair to relief as they assessed and reassessed NAFTA’s prospects. Two weeks ago, Mexico’s currency weakened and some U.S. trade-related stocks fell on a report that Canada was increasingly convinced President Donald Trump would pull the United States out of NAFTA. On closer examination, it was not clear there was anything particularly novel in the report and the Canadian government denied holding such pessimistic views, but the episode demonstrated the deep-seated concern among investors watching closely. For optimists, there were reassurances from Republican U.S. Senators to the contrary. Pat Roberts (R-KS), Chairman of the Senate Committee of Agriculture, said of the President, “I think he's seeing the big picture a lot better and the possible detrimental situation of what would occur if in fact he would terminate NAFTA.” Politics. It is relatively easy to argue that NAFTA withdrawal would be a political disaster for the President. It would hit at many red states that are dependent on farm exports and form the core of his political support. It would also hit at the auto sector, disproportionately affecting states like Michigan. And some recent market wobbles suggest that there is at least a chance that the move could undermine the business optimism that has helped propel the stock market to lofty Yet what matters is the President’s perception of the politics, and he sees antipathy to trade as central to his appeal to his base. NAFTA’s fate may depend on how compelled he feels to fire up that base. https://www.forbes.com/sites/phillevy/2018/01/22/the-nafta-withdrawal-threat-is-real/#7744422a6458 _________________________________ COMMENTS: I still like to keep my forecast on the lower side"

May even reduce it further the next time); - the probability that the renegotiations will fail. Here I reduce my probability estimate from 75% to 60%. The US has quite a leverage over both Mexico and Canada, being the largest - by far - trading partner for both, so it's not inconceivable that some sort of an agreement can be reached, especially if the US negotiators moderate their demands a little. It's still less likely than 50/50, though. - the probability that a notice will be provided if renegotiations fail. Here I keep 100%, as (i) if negotiations are allowed to fail (as opposed to being extended), this would mean that Trump has given up on an agreement; and (ii) if there is no chance of an agreement, Trump can't afford to do nothing - he would lose both face and credibility with his base."

His base simply wants somebody to look after what they perceive as ""taken advantage of by others"". Trump usually talk tough pre-negotiation. While walking away from a deal, or threaten to walk away, is a viable negotiation tactics, he won't use that unless necessary. For example, the first head of state Trump invited to the White House was the President of Mexico. The President of Mexico refused to meet him, thus lost an opportunity for negotiation. So far, Trump met with many heads of state, except the President of Mexico. That is negotiation 101 blunder from Mexico which Trump certainly will not make. Trump will threaten to walk away from the negotiation table only if he sees he could gain concession from Canada or Mexico. You can't use that bluff too many times. Trump is agenda-driven. He will be focused in internal politics (mid-term election coming up) and China-North-Korea region (unless something else flairs up). And he could do both by focusing on China-North-Korea: the best way to help himself internally is to have a coherent foreign policy. With the above, I would say Trump will not rock the NAFTA boat in 2018. The 2% chance is to account for the fact that Trump is really insane, as somehow too many sane Americans have come to that conclusion."
