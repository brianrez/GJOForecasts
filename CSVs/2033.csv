BUT these analysts are not aware of the political ramifications of such a claim. Noteworthy, this is not being denied or reported on in Iran, which is off as interest as they normally get pretty uptight on these issues of false accusations, as example http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=251026. And when they do something they think they are entitled to as October, then they dont deny just say - we are allowed.
