Spain is expected to ratify before 17th May, which will mean all members will have ratified by May. The option polls showed that there were around 20% who did not say they were either for or against NATO. Now that the US has ratified I would guess that some of the ""don't knows"" will decide that they do want to join. (Human nature is that you are usually keener to join a club if they have agree to let you in.) In any event the decision in Montenegro is that of the government, that has not agreed to a referendum, and the government wants to join NATO. A possible problem could be that 39 (out of 81) MPs have been disputing the October 2016 election, so the government has only a small majority over a Pro-Russian anti-NATO Opposition."
