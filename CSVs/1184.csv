According to their algorithm, 3 main pieces of info can be useful to providing a good guesstimate here: 1. was the film also nominated for Best Director? 2. was it also nominated for best editing? 3. did it win top honors from the Director's Guild of America (announced before Oscars)?"

Its the Hollywoodland version of ""The Night of the Long Knives."" One particular meme that has gotten street cred is that The Green Book does not offer an accurate representation of the African-American ""experience"" today. But the film is not about ""today."" Nobody said anything about the incipient racism a few years ago when the film ""The Express"" (about late Syracuse University Heisman winner Ernie Davis) was showcased when he traveled to Dallas in the Jim Crow south to play against Texas in the Cotton Bowl. Davis went to Dallas at the same time Don Shirley was touring the south. The PR ugliness we are seeing now could be just a spoonful of what might happen when presidential campaigns on behalf of candidates ""of color"" or ""hispanic"" or ""democratic socialists"" gain momentum. Add the ""Smollett Conundrum"" to the mix and there's likely to be a big demand a lot of ""Tony Lip's""... who can morph out of the ""muscle"" business and into ""PR""... but they might come from places other than the Bronx..."
