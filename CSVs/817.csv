This is due to expecting another 20-30% increase of the two vehicles in Q4 over Q3. With their China Gigafactory coming into production and the front and rear being a single stamped piece, I believe that they will increase their numbers. A decrease from Q3 would be the only way they don't hit 400,000 deliveries, which I view as extremely unlikely. I almost never make such a strong prediction, but this is a case that I must make that prediction. I am assuming that California continues to keep a grip on the COVID spread and prevents shutdown. Also, I don't expect Model Y to be produced in China until 2021. I think Musk is still shooting for 500k total vehicle deliveries in 2020, so that would put the 3 & Y prediction around 450k for the year."

Honestly, I don't see how they would manage to increase quarterly deliveries by roughly one third for Q3 and Q4 to reach the fourth bin, even though they stick to their forecast of 500,000 deliveries for the time being (50k of which then will be Models S and X and, haha, cybertrucks). E. Musk has not yet been reportedly seen walking on water. It seems he is more interested in big talk to make his second of twelve step option pay plan pay out (condition: 6 consecutive months of market value for Tesla Inc. of more than 150bn USD) and the option of Tesla Inc. being included in the S&P 500 (condition: four consecutive quarters of profitable business), thus shifting some payments to the front end by delivering even cars with faults and deficits to make a meager 104mn USD of Q2 profit. A good house of cards, about which the short shorts will laugh best in the end, maybe in 2020 already. Anyway, Mr. Musk will be over the mountains with 5bn USD in crypto currency by then, just like Jan Marsalek of Wirecard, his brother in arms. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirecard#Wirecard_and_the_Financial_Times_controversy"

From there, the covid effect on April-June could reduce the number, but given the progression of sales during the year (seasonality) the bigger part is still to come and should not be affected by covid. China sales were estimated at 90k using Europe's 2019 pattern which looks surprisingly similar, which we added to a simple regression line on past sales providing around 300k units in US - prior to covid. In essence, a point forecast would be around 380k units. Aknowledging for possible large variations (mostly lead by production capacity), we give equal chance within 350-400 than outside of that interval, with great favor of near-achieving the year plan."
