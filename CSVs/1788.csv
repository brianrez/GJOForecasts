I think for a suspension of immigration for so short a time, it might make more sense to use the provision Trump cited to during the campaign (which is given in the question summary) rather than the provision you've thought the administration would use, which would perhaps make more sense for a suspension of immigration that had real teeth... He may be doing it to be able to say to supporters of the campaign promise ""See: I did it"" rather than to have done anything of substance."

Phrased this way, it skirts the less obvious intent of putting a ban on the entry of all Muslims, which would invite serious opposition, particularly on Constitutional grounds. I believe that there is a greater chance of perceiving that the latter goal (banning all Muslims) could be largely accomplished in a practical way by making it less obvious to the eye. Wording of this sort on any legislation would go a long way toward fulfilling that goal; it will not fool many opponents, however, and therefore will promote fierce argument. Nevertheless I believe such wording gives it a good chance of meeting the April 30th deadline In light of the recent poorly designed executive order and the subsequent uproar it provoked, pivotal to whether this kind of action can effectively been implemented a second time will depend on how well the President's immediate actions in effecting a revised executive order as well as whether Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch faces a Democratic filibuster slowing down his confirmation."

I say this because this was also one of Trump's main topics of discussion during the election. Trump made a statement before, "" Immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur"". This means that he believes immigration produces fear and terrorists. One of the ways to prevent that is simply to ban it. He believes they are making their way into our country way too easily and there must be a stop."

You 100% cannot risk more lives of Americans, because innocent or not, if you are from their you may be a potential candidate for terrorism and we can not have that behavior in this country."

32388,2017-01-11T03:23:28Z,1,[85.0],[85.0],I think Trump will definitely do something about this because he seems to not really care about the well being of people outside of the US.
32385,2017-01-11T03:14:57Z,1,[95.0],[95.0],"Under a trump presidency it's extremely unlikely that we will see any refugees coming in any time soon. Trump has made numerous anti-Muslim statements and has gone as far to say not only that no Muslims will be allowed in, but ones already here will be highly supervised or even deported. Trump can apply his executive order to foresee how these decisions are carried out to ensure that not even states have the opportunity to decide to bring in refugees."
32387,2017-01-11T03:14:10Z,1,[44.0],[44.0],"I think that serious action will be taken right away against immigration from certain countries that can be seen as a terrorist threat because Trump has made it clear that this is one of his most important issues. It might not actually happen right away, but actions against will start right away."
32386,2017-01-11T03:13:05Z,1,[85.0],[85.0],I believe that the U.S. will suspend immigration from most countries that have a posing terrorist threat because Trump pushed this topic the most in his campaigning and very much wants to keep any one who could attack us out and focus on the problems with our own people first.
32381,2017-01-11T03:00:34Z,1,[85.0],[85.0],I think that there is a strong chance that the U.S. will suspend immigration from countries designated as a state sponsor of terrorism because this was a very significant part of Trumps campaign platform.
32384,2017-01-11T02:58:48Z,1,[100.0],[100.0],I think trump will definitely do something about the immigration. He basically ran his campaign on how he was going to kick out immigrants.
32380,2017-01-11T02:58:14Z,1,[95.0],[95.0],"Yes, because Trump believes that their are way to many immigrants in this country and that they are coming into our country to easily. This is what is going to spark the building of Trump's wall."
32353,2017-01-11T02:51:43Z,1,[95.0],[95.0],"Yes, there are way too many illegal immigrants that hid in our country and something needs to be done about it."
32373,2017-01-11T02:51:15Z,1,[90.0],[90.0],"I believe this to be very possible due to all of Trumps promises of a wall, and the slurs and negative names which he points towards anyone other than Americans. The history which we have with terrorism is scary, yes, but Trump believes the way to combat that issue is to not be compassionate to outsiders. Even Trump's talk of immigrants carrying a ""card"" (after heavy background scanning) which states their ethnicity has become normal during his speeches, so of course he would want to block out potential terrorists from the us."
32378,2017-01-11T02:43:14Z,1,[38.0],[38.0],"Ye, I believe Trump will follow through with this. I think in the future he will suspend immigration. He has a strong opinion on terrorist"
32374,2017-01-11T02:34:41Z,1,[73.0],[73.0],"I said yes at 73% because this is one of Trump's biggest concerns with the country, and I believe just because of the type of person he is, he will stick to what he said but at an extent by just forbidding a few countries from entering the U.S."
32376,2017-01-11T02:28:19Z,1,[50.0],[50.0],I am making this forecast because I believe it is possible to reduce the terror in our country in a short period of time but there could still be terrorists out there that we don't know of.
32372,2017-01-11T02:18:54Z,1,[78.0],[78.0],Yes I think they will suspend it because we do not need terrorists coming into our country. Especially if the country is one where terrorists are common to be and most likely attempt to get into our country.
32371,2017-01-11T02:18:09Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],"Yes i truly believe that TRUMP will want to stop immigrants from coming into the country, because America has to be worried about their own people not people from other countries."
32369,2017-01-11T02:14:10Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],Trump will follow through with this because he is big with not letting other powoplw into this state. He wants what's right for his people.
32370,2017-01-11T02:10:33Z,1,[21.0],[21.0],I think it is a possibilty that in the future he could suspend immigration. Although I feel as though this is too big of a task to be completed by 30 April 2017. This will take much longer and have a lot of political and economical fighting behind it. There is just too much controversy for it to get done in that little amount of time.
32284,2017-01-11T02:07:52Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],"Yes, because this problem is a big debate in our country right now. A lot of people are for it, and it does make sense."
32175,2017-01-11T02:04:50Z,1,[80.0],[80.0],"Trump has made his opinion and plan very clear for this topic. With rising concern about the danger of terrorist unpredictability, this will certainly be an issue that is on the front burner."
32367,2017-01-11T01:46:24Z,1,[65.0],[65.0],Yes. Trump does not want anyone else entering our country especially with the terrorism occurring more frequently.
32364,2017-01-11T01:41:58Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],
32251,2017-01-11T01:41:29Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],I think it is possible that the U.S. will suspend immigration from any country designated as a state sponsor of terrorism or a terrorist safe haven. Terrorism is one of Donald Trump's major platforms during his campaign. His goal is to stop terrorism.
32365,2017-01-11T01:36:27Z,1,[25.0],[25.0],That is racist
32363,2017-01-11T01:19:55Z,1,[85.0],[85.0],"I believe that this will occur in the first 100 days of Trumps Presidency, because he knows the kind of danger our country is in, and takes our national security very seriously."
32357,2017-01-11T01:19:46Z,1,[55.0],[55.0],It will be very difficult to make this happen. He probably won't be able to get this done during his hundred days but possibly after it.
32349,2017-01-11T01:16:54Z,1,[55.0],[55.0],this is a possibility because it is one of trumps greatest claims right now. he believes that banning immigration will greatly reduce our risk of terrorism
32306,2017-01-11T01:14:01Z,1,[88.0],[88.0],This has been a big problem everywhere in our country and people are concerned. I think that people will fear illegal immigration because of recent crimes. Trump is also filling his cabinet members with people that back him up
32361,2017-01-11T01:13:34Z,1,[60.0],[60.0],although this was one of Trumps main topics i do not believe that it will be accomplished within the first 100 days. i think there is a high possibilty of this happening though.
32359,2017-01-11T01:05:06Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],He has to deal with the liberals in congress.
32360,2017-01-11T01:01:18Z,1,[95.0],[95.0],this has been and will continue to be a huge problem everywhere in light of recent events acted upon by terrorist. trump will have a hard time trying to pass this but there are definitely people behind it because it is a big possibility at this time
32350,2017-01-11T00:12:54Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],I think there is a very high chance of this because of the fear that has been inflicted into our country since the acts of 9/11 and recent terror acts throughout the country recently have caused high alert of the precautions we must take in this country of which may involve trying to close all barriers to these possible terrorists and cutting off sources of possible communication to areas that sponsor this terrorism.
32355,2017-01-11T00:02:42Z,1,[60.0],[60.0],Trump is filling his cabniet with officials who have the same disposition about immigration.
32351,2017-01-10T23:55:35Z,1,[65.0],[65.0],"Trump has made it very clear that he thinks suspending immigrates from coming into the U.S will help with the terrorism. I do think he will do this, however doing it a short amount of time will be difficult."
32354,2017-01-10T23:51:46Z,1,[45.0],[45.0],I think Trump might actually be crazy enough to do this whether it be completely blocking immigration from countries or just stronger laws against it.
32352,2017-01-10T23:51:03Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],"Trump's slogan throughout the election was to ""Build the Wall"". He ran against Hillary who supported helping thousands of Syrian refugees and he wanted no part of that. He, at one point, said that he was going to stop all Muslims from entering the country."
32259,2017-01-10T23:15:11Z,1,[90.0],[90.0],I believe that Trump will do something to prevent immigration and protect us from terrorism. Trump was known in his campaign for supporting a stop to immigration it was one of his primary focuses. He would let down a lot of his supporters if he didn't do anything to stop or fix the issue.
32347,2017-01-10T23:05:37Z,1,[85.0],[85.0],I believe Trump will suspend immigration because we are at such a risk for terrorism and that is what he said he would make better.
32344,2017-01-10T23:04:00Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],"Yes, it is highly likely that the Republican senate will approve any bill Trump proposes about terrorism without thinking twice about the immediate effects it will have on the US in future. Even though it is a great idea to put the issue of terrorism first in your presidency, it is unconstitutional and illegal to brand or block certain groups of people who want to come to the US because they're are normally affiliated with terrorism. I don't know the criteria on which this blockage or 'safe haven' will be based on, it is unnecessary and undiplomatic way of checking the spread of terrorism. It makes the country more hostile and other affected countries might retaliate."
32346,2017-01-10T22:43:38Z,1,[90.0],[90.0],"I believe that trump will do everything in his power to stop immigration, in my opinion he hates immigrants and bives that just because there are terrorits anyone who is that same religion or race is also terrorists"

32343,2017-01-10T21:13:50Z,1,[80.0],[80.0],Due to the understaffed boarder patrols and illegal immigrants already in the U.S. This will suspend immigration from other countries

Not only because he said so but because he knows that this was one way people identified with him. This has a high chance of happening because it is Trumps idea of a safe and great nation, and I doubt he is eager to distinguish people's belief in him and his motto ""Make America great again"" However this may be unpopular with influential members of Congress making it unlikely to be 100% sure."

28091,2016-12-28T17:09:45Z,1,[95.0],[95.0],Trump made many promises during the campaign and most of them he can safely ignore and not act on. Taking steps to thwart terrorists is not one he can ignore and it could also help mute criticism for promises he does not keep. This is also something Trump can do on his own authority and this makes it almost certain that he will suspend immigration from at least one country.
