London is falling starkly, but some areas have retained momentum which keeps us at low increase figures. However The London effect historically radiates out over time - making the prognosis poor for the rest of the Uk despite inherent momentum up until now. Brexit and over-valuation of flats and high end properties have affected London - but Provinces tend to be less affected by international matters and over hyped development aimed at international buyers. This would suggest that rest of Uk may stall and perhaps fall a little in areas but will not pull the average down too sharply. Another negative indicator would be that the summer the construction purchasing managers’ index has suffered it's worst drop since 2009.... this is an index of how construction industry is purchasing and developing. A significant drop here means new development has slowed sharply - usually a result of not being able to 'shift' already completed projects and maintain cash flow."

Brexit remains an uncertainty but no major breakthrough has taken place since Nov 2018 (up to when the House Price Index data is available on the ONS website) nor a major change is expected in the few weeks that we have before end of Sep 2019 that would drastically alter the 12 month period figure anyway. Just the pound being weak might be a factor in favour of the house market. Simple linear regression of rolling 12-month period prices by month since the EU Referendum forecasts a figure of +1.55% for Sep 2019. The same calculation done using an exponential smoothing algorithm gives +1.62% (albeit 90% confidence intervals range from -0.1% to +3.3%). Therefore, my bet for between 1% and 3% as the most likely scenario."

Mortgage completions are also relatively stable, and the lack of available housing stock continues to ensure that prices remain on an relatively upward trajectory. The July Halifax Price index was showing a +4.1% annualised growth rate. Given that it takes approx 3-4 months for a transaction to complete, the changing political climate would have little effect on price inflation for the Sept figures, as these transactions would have already been near completion. But given that the London and SE markets continue to be depressed, and they drive so much of the total UK market, I think that we are looking at an annualised growth rate of around the 3.5% - 3.8% https://static.halifax.co.uk/assets/pdf/mortgages/pdf/July-2019-Halifax-House-Price-Index.pdf"

The problem is that this number is hard to beat given that with the seasonal changes removed by ONS in January 2019 the average price was 228,147. This technically already 1.3 lower than in September 2018. That means the prices need to go up from 228,147 in Feb 2019 to 238,740 in September 2019 to get into ""more than 3%"" interval. Tough luck. However, the employment figures are still good and increase in minimum wage from April (typically for young / first time buyers' spouse) may bring even more first time buyers to the regional and cheaper than 230K market. Therefore, there is still a good chance to achieve slightly above 1% growth, e.g. ca. 234K average price in September 2019. First time buyers tend to overpay so there is a good chance for increase as the entire baseline will move a bit. The issue is London which has substantial weight on average prices. The recent witch hunt of foreign-money-laundering activities may have some negative effect and may cool off the London market even further. Still a 60 million mansion is negligible on grand scale of things since there were 100.000 seasonally adjusted property transactions in February 2019 at average price of 228,000. This brings us to £22.8 billion worth of houses changing hands every month or 12.5 % of GDP (UK GDP 511.5 billion in Q4 2018 or roughly 170 bn a month). Four mansions at 50 Mio will pull the average by 1% easy though."

Since 3 weeks ago, supply in my area (outer south east) has started to increase markedly and there is a lot more market activity according to agents. The puff never went out of some areas, like Cambridge, but London has been weighed down by exit of foreign money and buy to let (10% or so centrally, local evidence for both). IF there is no Brexit or a very long, slow one, activity will bounce because uncertainty will be reduced. There is a constant low level of sales due to probate, divorce, unavoidable job moves etc., but also factor in a significant cost of moving in the south because of stamp duty, and CGT in some cases. But everyone's been holding their breath for 2-3 years so there is pent-up demand. I see static prices in first half of the year (using prices for 2018 which may have been discounted by 5% already) but increases in the second half as the market unfreezes. I also see the south moving faster than the north."

Based on historic data from 2006 percentage change was lower than -3% or higher than 3% 70% of the time. And only around 10% for each other bucket. However Brexit uncertainity makes over 3% bucket which represented 60% of historic data much less probable than it look from historic data. For now each of bucket seem almost equally possible for me and I am going to update depending on Brexit outcome and next months reports.
