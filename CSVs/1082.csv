I'm going 'all in'..... not exactly cautious but when I looked at the numbers and compared it to venom on my first forecast 90 - 110k was the figure that stood out for a DC / warnerBros release with a break-out solo villain character. Reviews have been either great or scathing.... and when I see 5 star reviews pitted against 2 star reviews that question the moral integrity and value of the film I just see publicity. Comic book fans will want to see it regardless..... the more discerning movie-goer will be intrigued by the Oscar buzz and conflicting reviews. The upshot is that I think it'll out do Venom and then more some.... tipping it into the territory I've chosen. Warner Bros see this as the first in a potential series of break out films so will be (have been) keen to promote... so we're looking at a 4000 plus theatre release to get it off to a healthy start..... $80k plus with the rest of the week bringing in enough to put it over the $90k mark.

(films featuring Joaquin Pheonix grossed on average at the box office around $7M in 2018, but this likely isn't an effective way of gauging the earning potential of the Joker as Pheonix stars in a number of obscure and sometimes short films likely not intended for national audiences.) Other possible indicators of the earning potentials of the film include pre-release awards, which as of September 7th include the Venice Film Festival's Golden Lion award (the last major American film to receive the award was the Shape of Water, which grossed $192M at the box office."

However as Jokers main trailer approaches 60 million views it has amassed 1.3 million likes which is a nice little indicator for how strong it will perform.

Both comic book fans and general audiences appear to be excited for this grounded and realistic take on the iconic Batman villain. Joker isn’t connected to any existing cinematic universe and doesn’t draw direct inspiration from the comics, and that seems to be striking a nerve. In its long range forecast, Box Office Pro has projected an opening weekend between $60 million and $90 million and a final domestic of $175 million. Not too shabby for a movie that cost just $55 million to make."

I understand why other DC/Marvel Universe films have done as well as they have. Joaquin Phoenix is a talented actor, but the target audience for this movie is interested in characters, not the performers. Very few will go see Mr. Phoenix if they are not interested in the character. The Joker character is at this point a stranded asset. The film will probably make its costs back, but will under-perform the expectations (and certainly the hopes) of its producers."

Based on what I've looked up, the economy has very little impact on cinema/theatre attendance. Peoples opinions and political views don't stop them from going to watch a movie and spin off prequel stories such as Rogue one (which I would tentatively compare the joker to) capture peoples attention and interest. What impacts box office takings though are BFFC ratings (or whatever the equivalent is in the US) with a 15 in the UK (and equivalent elsewhere) I'd expect the joker to take a 25-30% hit in comparison to such movies. The number of explosions in the trailers are lacking which means your typical ""End game"" fans will show less interest. But I still expect this to take over 130 mil. I'm not going to hazard at exactly how much and I might revise my prediction after some more analysis, but right now I find it hard to see this movie taking less than 145 mil."
