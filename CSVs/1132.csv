Jon Snow is the probability favorite, because the whole arc of the series is he stumbles into victories by being a good guy who doesn't want it and therefore is the only one who deserves it. The writers could still satisfy their need for twists by having him try to sacrifice himself for Dany and screwing it up and ending up good natured unwilling king. Lot of dark horses out there, still, though, with Sansa being probably the most likely ""other"" pick. Plus let's not rule out Drogon saying ""Screw y'all, I did all the work.
