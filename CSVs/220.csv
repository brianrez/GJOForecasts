Assuming that permanent stress is offsetting by top-quality healthcare and helthy lifestyle of Russian president, why shouldn't he live so? But I'm going further by assuming his LE term less a bit, such as 60 plus LE for 60-year-olds, which is 15.84, so it equals to 70 plus 5.84 years. Assuming 5.84 years ahead as the point of uncertainty, the probability of the issue is estimated as low as 0.6%. Thus let it be 1% because there theoretically other scenarios are possible."

He's at odds with many in the FSB. Military losses are mounting, and the numbers of stories of killed, wounded and defeated soldiers can only grow. 10 generals have supposedly been killed, and in the ballpark of 80k troops have been killed or wounded (https://www.newsweek.com/counting-russia-losses-200-days-ukraine-war-1741482 ). The military is frustrated that Putin won't call for a draft, because they know they can't win in Ukraine without more troops - and in addition to causing military losses and frustration in the upper (and lower) ranks, this indicates that even Putin himself doesn't feel he has the level of support in the population required for a draft."

In 2013 Russia imported about half its food, but today it is self-sufficient in basic food supplies. Russia reduced its reliance on foreign debt and amassed a huge supply of reserves in foreign currency. ""And sanctions as such cannot change his [Putin's] calculation, because for him, it's something like an existential struggle. And sanctions, yet, are not an existential threat to Russia."" So this question will be resolved in the long run. Is the closing date of this question too soon to tell? I'm reducing my forecast to 60%, which is still quite high, as I believe the intensity of sanctions will be felt sooner rather than later."

106224,2022-05-08T07:12:52Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"To my mind, there are various circumstances that would cause Vladimir Putin to cease to be the president of the Russian Federation on before January 1, 2023. These range from the position of presidency to no longer exist by then to Putin having to step down due to poor health to him being forced to step down by parliament, the judiciary or through an armed coup of some sort. Then of course there is the probability of death between now and then, from natural causes or following some sort of attack on his life.Coups are few and far between in powerful, developed countries such as Russia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_coups_and_coup_attempts_by_country#Russia). That gives us a near-zero prior probability. There are reports that suggest he has organised the security forces such that it would be very difficult to coordinate a military coup (https://www.vox.com/22961563/putin-russia-ukraine-coup-revolution-invasion). The same applies to a popular uprising (same source). This will also make it very unlikely that his life will be taken in an assassination attempt. While the probability is nonzero, I estimate it to be very low - let's say 1 per cent in a full year, and a fraction of that for the time between now and January 1.To my mind, the biggest threat to his presidency is his health. The annual mortality rate of Russian men is reported to be 39.1/1000 for 65-69-year-olds and 54.1/1000 for 70-74-year-olds. Putin will turn 70 early October. There are quite a few reports out there that suggest he may suffer from either Parkinson's disease or thyroid cancer. That may be so but we have not seen any evidence. The 'uncontrollable shaking' and his attempts to hide that from view (e.g., https://youtu.be/Xg3HgN11nG0 and https://youtu.be/SGZTNW-U8bw, respectively) may well be indicative of something but I think a diagnosis cannot be stated from these images alone (e.g., https://www.dw.com/en/putin-and-parkinsons-what-experts-say-about-his-health/a-61597476). The same applies to reports of a 'bloated face'. True, he doesn't look too well but if completely honest, I wouldn't have stated that unless I had heard somebody saying that (https://www.dw.com/en/putin-and-parkinsons-what-experts-say-about-his-health/a-61597476). And yes, he must be under tremendous pressure due to the war (from his perspective) not going well which must have all sorts of fallout that may be threatening to him. So my 'posterior' estimate for a Putin death from natural causes is simply the mortality rate for 70-74-year-olds. He's not 70 yet and he'll be a youngster in the 70-74-years-old bin. Had there been no reports or signs of bad health, nor any assumed pressure then I would have taken the mortality rate for the 'younger' bin for the ~5 months between now and his birthday and the rate for the 'older' bin for the ~3 months between his 70th birthday and the closing time of the question.What I am leaving out is the scenario in which bad health renders him unable to fulfil the duties of a Russian president and that he'll be 'nudged' to step down. I find this very difficult to assess; 'health' is something I have virtually no expertise in. What could happen? A stroke? A heart attack? It's suggested that in the US, the average probability of a stroke for 65-69-year-old men is 11.0%/10 years and 13/7%/10 years for men in the 70-74-year-old age bin (https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/patient-caregiver-education/brain-basics-preventing-stroke). That's only for strokes. Would that render him incapacitated? Again, let's up the odds a bit by taking the higher number, for reasons of assumed pressure/stress and for not knowing the probabilities of heart attack or any other condition that would incapacitate him.Combining the probabilities gives us 1% probability of a coup/uprising, 5.23% probability of death from natural causes and an additional 1.3% for a stroke - all for a period of one year. Adjusting these for the partial year between now and January 1 gives us 3.41%, 0.89% and 0.65%, respectively. Let's assume these are all independent events (bad health and death probably aren't): that gives a probability of 4.96%.(PS the uncertainties in any of above dwarf the decimal-point estimates, I know)"

I don't see him resigning, being forcefully replaced any time soon. He could be assassinated, or he could die of ill health. He's 69 and Russian life expectancy is 73, but as Putin is receiving good medical care we can use the USA's expectancy of 79 at a base, or even his predecessor's predecessor, Gorbachev's current age of 91 as a base. That means he's got a less than 4.5% to 10% chance of dying per year, but the risk rises the older one gets and he's still 4 years under the Russian average. I'm therefore lowering it from 4.5%."

I will halve it, as we are nearly half way through the year, so 1.1%. (I'll ignore that that rate has to be much higher in Russia, assuming it is offset by his access to the best health-care in the country, and no apparent drinking problem.) While he may be demonstrating symptoms, and there are reports of his being visited by an oncologist, I'm not inclined to give that much weight until there's some sort of confirmation or detail, not least because it seems unlikely that even if he is afflicted by some cancer, that it will progress enough to force him out of office by the end of the year. Similarly if it's Parkinson's, that's even less likely. He is subject to stand again for re-election, or so I understand, by March 2024, but that improves his chances of staying in power, as he can use it to hold off pressure from public discontent and/or from his own small circle power constituency, whatever that may be. I stand ready to update with new information, but for now I don't see health as adding up to more than 1% probability for this proposition. If the war turns very badly for him ... well, that possibility drives up the probability of his ouster, clearly and perhaps significantly. But without taking too much time to think it through, I'm inclined to think it would have to go very badly indeed for him to face a coup or such a level of popular unrest to bring that about. At the moment, I'm thinking that if we replay this movie a hundred times, it is less than once that Putin plays his hand badly enough to face a strong enough coalition to remove him from office by year's end, even in the event of a major reversal in eastern Ukraine, or a failed second major offensive."

He has absolute control of the government and state media, and there are no political rivals with any means of building a power base. The danger to his position has increased due to the failure of the Russian army's attacks on Kyiv and other major cities in Ukraine, and the immense casualties sustained in the attempt. Any threat would be likely to come from the military and be prompted either by a desire to avoid the destruction of the Russian army in an endless war of attrition or by fears that President Putin would resort to nuclear weapons to stave off total defeat."

Generous estimates suggest the Russian economy could shrink by 7% next year, instead of the 2% growth that was forecast before the invasion. Others say the drop could be as much as 15%. Would Russia claim victory? It could, but right now there is little good to claim; Kyiv was not taken, and today’s news of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, the Moskva missile cruiser, was badly damaged when ammunition on board blew up, is no good news for Putin. In fact, more news came today of Putin's defense minister Sergei Shoigu has had a 'massive heart attack, not from natural causes' and TWENTY generals 'have been arrested' over bungled invasion https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10718247/Putins-defence-minister-Sergei-Shoigu-massive-heart-attack-not-natural-causes.html There are estimates that as many as 12,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. A rough estimate based on life expectancy and GDP per capita suggests that a death toll of 10,000 Russian soldiers would correspond to a cost of more than US$4 billion. To this, one would need to add the huge mental health toll on their families, and on all the soldiers who took part in an active war. The paltry compensation announced by Putin to the families of dead soldiers will be paid in local currency, meaning its actual value may soon be close to zero. These are not immediate problems, but I do wonder what Putin will do IF he conquers Ukraine? First of all, he can’t afford it. Ukrainians will hate Russia to the end of their days, and probably there will be social unrest and never-ending problems. Russia would be a pariah state and in misery. But right now, can the Russian military and defense industry survive without technological imports such as electronics and industrial robots from the West? https://americanmilitarynews.com/2022/03/russia-stops-tank-production-because-it-cant-get-parts-ukraine-says/ Now: 1. Can Putin claim a victory of sorts, and everything will fall back like before. Oligarchs will go back to their good life like nothing ever happened. Ukrainian will never submit to Russia. 2. ‎The war drags on all summer long, with all the consequences mentioned above, every Russian is still happily unaware of the war, while the ones that count still go along with Putin's craziness. ‎3. Ukraine wins the war, and the loser must pay Ukraine for the damages. 4. ‎NATO intervenes. Russia is finished."

I always thought of the Russian power aparatus as a black box, and right now probably more than usually. I will writing here my thoughts about the probably most complex political entity in the world and as of writing this sentense I have now idea what will come out of this thought process. The first issue I trying to understand: Why is the Kremlin such a black box in the first place? As I understand it, Putin doesn't trust his own institutions, and in that he is hardly alone, I assume misstrust is actually quite rampant in this circles, I imagine it actually a quite fearful and often hostile environment to work or just to move around in. Nobody really knows for sure what are the others are up to, what allegences they have, who owns favors to whom, what are the hidden agendas, stuff like that. And my guess is that Putin is just much more skillful in this game than almost anybody else and that he is purposefully keeping that way, just to minimize the chances a potiential rival might threaten him. So nobody is really trustworthy and not really trusting anybody. Everybody can be removed from his or her position at any moment and is in servival mode trying to get as much as possible out of the system because the clock counting down while not knowing what time the clock actually showing. As a side effect of that, lots of vital information doesn't get passed along to the people in charge, cause it's quite assured that vital information at one point is going over the desk of somebody, who has an incentive that facts do not reach a decisionmaker higher up in the hierachy. I'm not wondering so much anymore that Russia's armed forces turned out to be a paper tiger or, tragically for the Russsian soldiers in Ukraine, a better fitting term: a potemkin army. At moment (in my estimate) Putin's biggest concern right now is to prevent that public opinion turning against him and the security apparatus and/or the armed forces (or parts of it) is then siding with demonstrators. I'm thinking of scenario like Romania, when Ceaușescu was overthrown. It can be safe to assume that the power balances within the kremlin between the various service branches and factions are right now quite volatile and is rearranging. Another open question is who is taking the (public) blame for that. In anyway it will be more difficult for Putin to shift the failure to some other officials, cause the whole invasion was presented as his idea, so I think nobody is keen to take the responsibility for it and trying shift the blame. And blaming the West for it, is also a harder sell this time. It also depends now what are the Ukrainians doing now as is seems that they are now getting the initiative. Are they trying to retake Donbass (likely) and Crimea (very much unlikely in my estimate, Russia might use that as justification for using nukes). My guess is, when Russia can get Crimea recognized as Russian and Ukraine giving up it's claim on it, that would be something Putin could sell to the Russian public as the goal he wanted to achieve in the first place. That is in my estimate at the moment the (most likely, but still miniscule) best case scenario right now: Ukraine gets Donbass and some kind of (limited) west integration, while Russia gets Crimea recognized as Russian. Probably still a hard sell for both sides (especially for Selensky). So right now I give it a speculative 43% that Putin won't be President of the Russian Federation by the end of 2022. I would be really keen what's the take you guys have. I definitely missed a lot to take into consideration and I'm curious to know what that might be. So as always: Thanks you in advance for your comments and critiques."

Some assumptions baked into my forecast are that the Russian economy will limp along with the contraction limited to being less than 10% and that there will be a continued stalemate over Kyiv for the rest of the month. At this point, Putin could still probably negotiate an exit on somewhat favorable terms (e.g. a promise from Ukraine not to join NATO, sanctions relief, and possibly acceptance of Crimea and the separatist regions as independent states or autonomous regions). I don't think he will go for such a deal, but if he does, I will consider that he has removed a big source of uncertainty around his position. On the other hand, if he doubles down.

I thought at the time that Ukraine was sort of on its own and thought the Russian army would roll to Kiev in a couple of days, securing Putin's political future. My update: I believe Russia is facing all-out war in 5 dimensions. (These are guesses; I have no security clearance.): 1. Physical/terrain: Getting worse now as the ground thaws. 2. Financial: We are seeing the maturity of finance as an effective strategic capability in modern warfare. Pretty incredible results. 3. Intelligence: US & NATO systems are likely feeding Ukraine non-stop. Ukraine has clarity on Russian moves; Russia probably can't see much at all. 4. Electronic warfare: I believe US & NATO are supporting Ukraine in a proxy manner, giving them hardware we program/control, but Ukraine operates, keeping operations limited to emanation from Ukrainian systems. How else could Ukraine get airplanes in the air against some of the best anti-aircraft weapons in the world? 5. Cyber: Again, I believe US & NATO are supporting Ukraine in a proxy manner. Russia probably sees Ukraine taking action, not knowing where the source code originates. Summary: Putin is staking his political future on success in Ukraine to return Russia to its former glory as a great power. I believe his quest is doomed and he's doomed with it because it's all-out warfare in the dimensions we can't see (points 3-5 above). But oligarchs still expect Putin to protect their wealth, Russian families want their soldiers home, the general public expects victory, and generals want out of the quagmire (either by winning or retreat). At this point, Putin can't deliver to any of them."

Then there's the unknown spectre of Putin's physical and mental health. At the moment NATO appears to be sitting tight, but if the accusation of atrocities increases or Zelenskyy/western journalists are killed, the pressure to react militarily is likely to increase. Noticeable in the UK that pressure to respond is mostly coming from the centre rather than the political right or left. This is significant in that centrists control much of the UK media and therefore a good deal of political noise. It's unusual to see the right and left allying over a cautious approach to military intervention, but there may be only so much noise the situation can take before Johnson feels compelled to act, and Mr Johnson's 'acts' on other issues have brought with them considerable pain.

The war is not having the rapid course that could have been expected, also a sign of a kind of improvisation by Russia. If the army was not even supposed to enter the Donbas, imagine how it could be ready to take Kyiv quickly. At the same time, the initial apparent embarrassment of Europe has given way to targeted and decisive action against Russia. Russia is now finding it difficult to get out of this conflict, risking getting mired in a long conflict with the Ukrainian resistance. And for the European Union, this scenario is the best possible, if it can partially make up for the gas shortage. Russia is isolated and fragile inside.

100264,2022-02-28T16:45:26Z,1,[39.0],[39.0],"The invasion isn't going as planned and the Ukrainians are fiercely resisting (I guess also to the surprise of most Western observers, certainly I didn't expect this massive resistance). I assume Putin also underestimated the Western response in form sanctions and now weaponry is just flowing into Ukraine, so the death toll of Russian fighters and loss of material is going to continue if Putin decides to press further. Putin has a history of blaming somebody else, when something went wrong, be it West or the incompetence of other Russian political figures. But that is not going to work that easy this time, the whole retoric and propaganda in the months and weeks before the invasion was explicitly coined on Putin himself. I'm quite sure that the military leadership and ministers is not willing to take the blame for that desaster, especially given that Putin has an intelligence background and there seems to be a historic rivalry between the armed forces and the intelligence services. So I woundn't wonder that high ranking military might be thinking to remove Putin from his postition, especially now as he ordered to put the nuclear forces into high alert. Also a lot of Russian public figures are coming out against the war and many of them are said to have been closely associated with Putin. Like the rats are leaving the sinking ship. According to Emmanuel Macron, Vladimir Putin became more ""hardened"" and stubborn in his personality. Might be that the people, working for Putin, might have been to affraid, to deliver him uncompfortable information, almost like Putin believed his own propaganda, that the Ukrainian poplulation is just waiting to welcome the Russians. So far that is, what speaks against Putin. but there are also some development for him staying in power. Here are some updates which give in my opinion a good overview: https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine-conflict-updates Seems to me that the negotiations right now at the Ukrainian/Belorusian border are also a way to buy some time, to get more reinforcements into Ukraine. But it took already several months and weeks to get the current forces deployed, so reinforcements are coming in, but might take same time. That might be a window to try find a diplomatic solution. And furthermore this also gives the Ukrainians time to regroup and getting more weapons and ammunition. Not so sure that it will get much easier for Russia. Also when the protests in Russia are more spreading, the security authorieties might also run into shortage of manpower because they are also needed for a possible occupation after military victory and I doubt Russia is able to recruit many Ukrainians as they have hoped for. This were a lot of thoughts, but it also shows the volatility of this whole situation. So I would appreacciate your comments and thoughts. What did I get right, what I got wrong and what did I miss. Thanks you!"

Not because of some people’s uprising—that’s a fanciful dream—but because there is now a small but non-zero chance of a palace coup. The economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation of Russia is going to be very severe and will impact not just the well-known oligarchs, but many in the intelligence and military circles who have been personally enriching themselves under Putin’s regime for decades. What’s more is they now realize that the sanctions will not end no matter what happens in Ukraine now while Putin is in power. That is why personal sanctions on him were so symbolically important. Putin has also physically isolated himself to extreme extent due to his COVID fears (there is a theory that he is also unvaxxed which is contributing to his fear of getting sick). So one can see a scenario where some people from the siloviki faction will decide that they’ve had enough of the old man and it’s time to put him out to pasture and try to get a detente with the West that is now all but impossible under Putin’s rule.

Internally it seems the country is mixed - among the people there are many that are ready for change, but their voice has long been silenced. Also internally are the others in power, military and oligarchs, who are going to feel an impact from recent actions. Whether that impact is enough to get them to apply pressure to Putin and how quickly that happens is the question. 2023-01-01 is only 10 months away, which seems relatively short.

Considering the US 'neutralised' Bin Laden, how far does it seem likely the Pentagon or NATO allies will go to defuse what amounts to a live nuclear threat? Amid rumours of illness, paranoia, national dissatisfaction and demotivation among Russian troops + the prospect of drawn-out assaults against neighbouring countries (the invasion of Ukraine + threats against Finland & Sweden), I strongly suspect this is a doomed 'Last hurrah', though acknowledge the chaos surrounding this prediction & the possibility of an epic fail."

62538,2022-02-26T20:43:27Z,1,[1.0],[1.0],Putin has surrounded himself with people who are quite loyal. He can make both candidates and parties illegal. He can nullify elections. About the only way at this point for him to not be president is to die or have some sort of incapacitating accident.
102121,2022-02-26T20:34:59Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"starting above the crowd on this question. At this point I am making the assumption that the situation in Ukraine will not improve for Putin i.e., Russia will outright fail in taking control of Ukraine or it only does so at massive costs (continuing sanctions, increasing protests domestically, ...). I have no doubts that Putin intends to stay in power but, fundamentally, it is other people that are keeping him in power: the police that arrest protestors, the army generals that carry out his invasions, the oligarchs that toe the line. If the attempt to invade Ukraine becomes increasingly unpopular and looks like a failure, and crippling sanctions look like they are here to stay, will anyone have an interest in helping Putin hold on to power? The police can't just go on arresting people for ever, but people are likely to keep having reasons to protest. The army seems to have been mislead to the extent that, reportedly, captured Russian soldiers are saying they never planned to actually be at war, and they are now failing to achieve any important objectives. The oligarchs are looking at losing billions and the free access to the west that they enjoyed. However, there is no alternative to Putin at the moment. There are obviously no other major politicians, well known opponents like Navalny are dead, and the leadership around Putin seems weak (e.g., the intelligence chief he intimidated in the published meeting video). Could any oligarch try to make the jump, either in Russia or from abroad (Khodorkovsky?). Therefore, I am not going too high yet."

The way to make this happen, if anybody is interested, is to go after the very richest Russians--not the apparatchiks but the plutocrats--with very tight and severe sanctions. Charge them with something criminal--doesn't matter what--then freeze all of their overseas assets including especially their London digs, don't let them enter or fly over anybody's territory, don't let any of their companies or the state-owned ones do any business anywhere, and generally do Russia like we've been doing Cuba--a full economic blockade (which, being illegal, will have to be called an embargo)."

He will face immense international and some domestic pressure to step down or assume a different role. He may also calculate that he can step down officially but still rule behind the scenes. All things considered though, Putin has navigated other challenges to his rule and survived. The absence of a clear opponent, his wealth and institutional entrenchment, and a population that is controlled by his propaganda efforts make it unlikely he will be replaced by 2023."
