The movement of the first Falcon Heavy contract with Inmarsat to Arianespace for mid 2017 doesn't suggest however that a commercial Falcon Heavy Launch will occur before this time, the delays caused by the Amos satellite explosion will not help this either. The announcement of Iridium satellites being launched on a Falcon 9 spacecraft planned for early January also fulfils our expected launch rate for the initial 2 months of 2017, suggesting that bar a rushed through demo flight (Wikipedia (citing Spaceflight now) states this is scheduled for Q2 2017) there is little chance of another SpaceX launch in this period, never mind one on a new yet-to-be-launch-tested spacecraft."

28091,2016-08-30T15:35:42Z,1,[40.0],[40.0],Spacex has an excellent percentage of Falcon 9s reaching LEO once they are launched (96%). The Falcon Heavy based on Falcon 9 should also have a high likelihood of reaching LEO once it is launched. The question is when. Spacex has the inherent conflict of needing to avoid another Falcon catastrophe but also needing to schedule launches often and keep to their schedule to be attractive to customers. Delays in launches are common and given that the Falcon heavy is a new rocket and has already been delayed another delay would not be surprising. The pressure to deliver on time is probably greater for their mature Falcon 9 technology which provides steady income. Spacex can probably afford delays of the Falcon heavy if it will increase the likelihood of a successful first launch.

SpaceX has been conservative in delaying launches when an unplanned rapid disassembly occurs. However, we're getting close to November (4 months) and there has been no delay since March, implying that they are on track or close to it. The most recent delay was only 2 months. Assuming the delays continue to be for shorter times, it would take three more delays to miss the window. However, any issue with Falcon9 will likely take precedence and for that reason I deem this new program to be at higher risk. I'm betting that no significant failures will occur between now and March and that if one does occur, the resolution will not be to use the March 3 scheduled second flight as the first but to simply delay for a couple of months."

Hopeless optimism might be a management tool at this company. (Still amazing accomplishments though.) - Prior to June 15 2016, the target was ""not before December 2016"" for the maiden flight. With the failed landing on the drone ship I would expect some resources to be consumed with working out the kinks with that system. - The 2nd flight is to be the first to carry cargo to LEO, earliest date is after the deadline. - Will the maiden flight even go to LEO? I guess so, but as a non-expert just don't know."
