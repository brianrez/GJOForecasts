Higher transmission rate though and an excellent incubation time coupled with a window of infection makes it a good candidate for further mutation into something more unpleasant but that won't be seen (if at all) until later in the year. A little more insidious and slower burning than Sars in that it's believed to be fairly contagious for a good asymptomatic period..... ie you have it but you don't know it. With China a bit slow to get off the mark and handle this I fear we may be looking at exceeding sars figures before summer.... I hope I'm wrong.
