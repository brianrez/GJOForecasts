"Between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2018, will an armed group from South Sudan engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in South Sudan?",2017-12-28T18:00:41Z,2018-04-01T06:59:41Z,Yes,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],373,654,201,237,"The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (Early Warning Project). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 31 March 2018 and will be resolved in January 2019 after EWP assesses the situation in South Sudan from January 2018 through December 2018. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilian fatalities occur in one or more campaigns. See (Early Warning Project) for examples.

57088,2018-03-27T20:26:30Z,1,[55.0],[55.0],"Several concerning factors lead me to think that the chances that more than 1,000 could be systematically killed in South Sudan over the course of this calendar year. First, the US government and indeed US based NGOs or interest groups generally, are so involved in domestic problems that it is unlikely that any African country will be the subject of any consideration during 2018. Secondly, the African Union and European Union will therefore be the major players. Paul Kagame of Rwanda is the 2018 chairman of the AU Assembly and he is a man who would like to earn respect from his fellow African leaders. The Kenyans and Ethiopians would no doubt prefer to slow the tide of refugees. The EU has the same motivation. At the same time, if we look at other states in the region with endemic civil war (Congo for example), it appears that lack of central government control and severe drought have led the FEWS to predict famine at level 5 through May in parts of the country. The COH from December is not holding and conditions on the ground appear to be highly unstable. The real question here is will a systematic, fatal attack on 1,000 civilians be made. I have little doubt that many more than that will die of famine in this time period. FEWS suggests that only sustained humanitarian aid will prevent that from happening. My yes may be too strong because I have worked a bit with refugees from South Sudan and they have expressed profound fear of ongoing violence. Even the local Kenyans have withdrawn back from the SS border because their cattle have been stolen and they are starving."

The current cease fire seems unlikely to hold as there are reports of the government using oil wealth to rearm and fund armed groups. A series of clashes have occurred already this year and without an apparent route to reestablish peace I think it unlikely that tensions will calm. Furthermore, FEWSNET has is not classifying more areas of South Sudan as Phase 4, conflict makes famine worse and vice versa. Attacks on UN and other humanitarian relief organisations have been frequent in the last year and it is likely that famine will be used as a weapon attacking civilians. The risk of famine also explains the increase in incidences of cattle raiding, it is likely that this will only increase sparking more conflict as the food supply worsens."
