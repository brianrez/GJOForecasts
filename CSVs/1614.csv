Still, fewer are denying rumors that discussions/plans are in the works to re-open them as several did in this spring/summer (Britain, Netherlands, etc).

The first is the straight forward question of it being safe for the diplomats, the second is does any authority exist in the specific location where the embassy is, that can be considered to be the legitimate and de facto government of Libya. Legally an embassy is to some specific authority. It seems to me that in practice it is not clear what the authority in Libya is - The GNA is recognised as the authority and they do more or less control Tripoli, but not securely and the GNA does not control the majority of the country. Because Libya is a divided country most problems that diplomats are trying to address require negotiations with and between different factions that control different areas of the country and do not trust each other, and therefore need to take place on neutral ground, which means somewhere outside Libya. Therefore although Libya has a lot of problems that foreign governments would like solved, it is not immediately obvious that this can be done better by an embassy within Libya than one in Tunis. Having said that, Italy re-opened its embassy in Tripoli some months ago. It is reported that France has irritated Italy by hosting talks between the two rival Libyan governments, but France has suggested that Italy had been wrong to back a Misrata based militia. I would suggest that having an embassy within Libya, which means working with who ever controls the territory in which you are based, creates an obvious impression that your country supports one faction over the others, which may not be helpful. Therefore I suggest that most western countries might see getting agreement for a single Libyan government needs to come before re-opening embassies. However if one moves they will probably all move."

The UN return will signal the other EU nations to return and it looks like that is a ways off."
