Currently, such strong opposition isn't there, but it is far from unthinkable in the current climate that some incident would cause Peter Robinson to step aside and not resume his post within a week.

The then NI Secretary suspended the Assembly for 24 hours, which allowed another 6 weeks for talks to continue before the Assemly had to be dissolved."

Sinn Fein will want to avoid direct rule in hopes of avoiding the UK's welfare reform/austerity policies. DUP was very quick to announce a return to the Assembly after an independent report was released that more or less cleared Sinn Fein of involvement in recent murders. There is a lot of grandstanding going on but no desire to suspend the Assembly.
