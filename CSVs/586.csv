Positive factors: original New Start was negotiated by the Obama administration, and Biden sounds likely to want to continue that legacy. An extension without additional conditions is simpler than a negotiated agreement, and would set the Biden administration on a productive start with the Putin administration. Trump seems like he was happy to let it expire, while extending it would be a repudiation of sorts of Trump foreign policy, and perhaps increases the likelihood of the Biden administration trying to extend the treaty.
