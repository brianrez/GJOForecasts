The only difference is that I see a bevy of normalization measures across the states in terms of dropping mask mandates, proof of vaccination, etc. and a higher proliferation of at-home testing options (read: not reported to CDC). This suggests the numbers may fall more dramatically versus hanging as it did in Jan 21. I am more confident though that we will not go below the 50K in the next 31 days.

Of course, no variant has lasted that long, but the variants that have replaced the ones before have been more contagious, not less. Also, at that level of infections, we can expect to detect 1/3 to 1/4 of all infections, so we'd record ~72k/3.5 = 21k/day. So I see a huge amount of uncertainty here.

The decline will be a bit slower, but we could conceivably even end up at <50k/day before the end of February. Last year, what prevented us from reaching <50k/day in by the end of March was Alpha; we don't see any such new variant on the horizon yet. We don't yet know how long immunity to Omicron will last, but I don't see why it should last any shorter amount of time compared to immunity to any other variant. I think the only reason we wouldn't see <50k/day in bin 2 would be if a new variant emerged. That could still very well happen, so I leave open that possibility."

But I suspect that Omicron cases, by themselves, will be below 50k/day by the end of Feb. I think the only reason why US cases didn't fall below 50k last March was because Alpha came up. We don't yet see a new, important variant on the horizon, but on the other hand, it would be hard to detect a signal during the Omicron wave.

Secondly, since the current 7-day average is still climbing, one could assume that the surge will maximize in January and begin to decline like last year closer to February. More troubling is the climb down from this surge is well above previous waves (I assumed ~900000 peak).

It is summer in SA and winter in USA, so that can certainly work against America in how soon the surge lets up, and even USA's pre-omicron levels are above 50,000.

If we could know that no other variant would emerge, I'd be almost certain that bin 2 would be the outcome. bin 3: possible, as a new variant could arise. Last year, Alpha came up, but cases still fell <50k/day by May 1. bin 4: possible if a wild new variant emerges that causes a large spike in cases, larger than the relatively small Alpha wave last year, or if 2 smaller waves succeed Omicron. bin 5: it's hard to see how bin 5 could happen, based on last year's experience. Some combination of 2-4 new variants would need to emerge that would need to be timed well enough to cause sequential waves large enough to prevent cases from dipping <50k/day in between.

As things get more infectious it is harder to flatten the curve. Plus we are employing less social distancing measures to do so. Omicron should burn out faster than delta. My guess is 2.5 months. Cases started jumping around dec17th, so my guess is that the peak will be 1st or 2nd week in february and we will be at a nadir around march 1st. One question is whether another variant will come around that can outcompete omicron. Delta rose to prominence because it was more infectious that the original strain. That's getting harder and harder to do as variants get more and more infectious. Omicron rose to prominence partially because of a higher infectious rate and also because it evades immunity. That seems the more likely route for new variants to come up. How likely is that to happen? Not sure, but if it happens, it's likely to happen faster than it did for delta, since omicron will flare and die down faster than delta did. Let's say there is a new variant. It will likely be as infectious as omicron, but not more - the reason it will rise is because it can infect people who already have immunity. That means that the time from start to finish of a new wave would be the same - 2.5 months. That would put us at June-July timeline."
