I assume Putin prefers the first option. For this reason, they can quickly retreat to the eastern bank of the Dnieper or try to inflict painful losses in the delayed fighting in Kherson. The first should be done before November 25th. The second scenario is the possibility of withdrawing forces from the city, when the fight is very close and the Ukrainian artillery controls the river crossings. Rather, they may choose to fight ISIS-style (eg Mosul) with small forces (500-1000 men, Spetsnaz) that will be able to retreat to the other side after about 1-2 weeks.

So, Ukraine reconquering territory is not an event that has happened very often during the overall war. However, the recent attempts from Ukrainian forces have been successful, and this will probably influence Ukrainian soldiers’ motivation to fight Russians. Russian army, on the other hand, may respond more aggressively to stop Ukraine’s counteroffensive. Russia is also more prepared to deal with Ukranian counter-offensives right now than it was a few weeks ago when Ukraine started to reconquer territory."

Yet, Kherson is also only 80 km away from Ukrainian controlled Mykolaiv and just next to territory recently re-claimed by Ukrainian counter offensives. Furthermore, Kherson is in “reported Ukrainian counter offensives territory” and the Ukrainian army has made important recent advances in the territories nearby. As the building is a symbol of the city, Ukrainian counteroffensives may capture it (or better, recover it) before they regain the whole area. I hence give a higher probability that the building will be under Ukrainian control by 15 November."

I eagerly want Ukraine to reestablish control over the city, but I am trying to temper my desires for a certain outcome when analyzing the situation and forecasting probabilities. Given the impressive lightening counteroffensive the Ukrainian forces have orchestrated in the past month, it feels as though military momentum is on their side. Also, my understanding is that informal partisan violence against Russian occupying forces and civil disobedience toward administrative officials have been particularly intense in Kherson, relative to other occupied cities, suggesting that there will be internal pressure easing the way for the Ukrainian offensive into the city. There is also news about how Russian occupying administrative officials have begun evacuating from the city, suggesting that the Russian government recognizes that its hold over the city is at risk. These on their own would put my baseline prediction at around 70%."

First, the defense (i.e. Russia) holds an advantage when fighting in urban terrain. While Kerson is not a huge city, there are still four rivers they need to cross before getting into the city and 20-30 blocks they’ll need to clear of Russia forces. This is no small task if the Russian defenses remain in place and fight. Russia is also bombing cities and infrastructure at an astonishing pace. The city council building may not even be standing by 25 November. If it is, there is a chance that it will be radioactively toxic or that it will be underwater as Russia has threatened both ‘dirty bombs’ and flooding to prevent Ukraine from regaining the city."
