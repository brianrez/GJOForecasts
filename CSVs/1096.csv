Scientists are closely following these upheavals and trying to determine which ones may be potentially dangerous 1-2 weeks in advance. To reduce the likelihood of undesirable events, even reverse the process, for accurate predictions with these, it may also benefit from a mix of old and new ancient knowledge.

Most frequent forecasts are 2 major hurricanes for this season including 1 ranging from 2 to 4. Most violent months are mid-August to late October. 2 months passed without major events (early season). Previous forecasts don't allow to draw a seasonal prevision. It tends frequently to overpass 2 hurricanes per season. Frequency rises since early 2000's compared to previous decades. Stochasticity is to be accounted."

My starting point was 0-1%, 1-4%, 2-10%, 3-45%, 4 or more - 40%. After considering the other possible but more rare outcomes (5, 6, 7 etc) which would account probably for 1-5% in decreasing likelihood (4% for 5, 3% for 6, etc), I increased my 4 or more number by the sum of the %s for 5-8 (10%) and subtracted the amounts in descending order from the other 4 options (though left 0 at 1% pending the first cat 4 storm of the season). I've not yet looked into how the start of the season correlates with major storm numbers, but according to wikipedia, this season is making records for early storms which strikes me as an ominous sign for more to come. I believe nat weather center is forecasting 2 ""major"" storms, but I havent figured out how they define ""major."" Assuming they're good at their jobs, if ""major"" means cat 4 or higher, I will probably shift my forecast back toward 2-3, again, with a slightly greater emphasis on 4+ for reasons stated above."

This is an average of 1.625 such hurricanes per year. Some years there were no major hurricanes (83, 86, 87, 90, 93, 94, 97, 06, 12, 13) whilst in others there were 4 or more (99, 04, 05, 10, 17), or 3 (88, 95, 08) . From this it would appear that the greatest probability would be 1 or 2 hurricanes. Looking in more detail, hurricanes seem to be dependent upon (i) the ocean surface temperature (if it is over approx 26.5 degrees Celsius then hurricanes can more easily form and there is a correlation between increased surface temp and increased storm intensity) and (ii) the shearing winds over the ocean which will hinder hurricane formation if they are strong. The shearing winds appear to be related to the El Nino effect, such that in significant El Nino years there are increased shearing winds over the Atlantic and fewer hurricanes develop. Over the last 40 years, El Nino effects were significant in 80, 83, 86, 87, 91, 93, 94, 97, 02, 04, 06, 09, 14, 15 and 19. They apparently are cyclical, with effects lasting for around 6-18 months and occurring every 2-5 years on average. There is a very noticeable correlation between the El Nino years and the years in which there were none or only one major hurricane (cat 4 or above). This would seem to suggest that in an El Nino year, there is more chance of none or only one major hurricane."
