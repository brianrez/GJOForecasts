Tough balance. I think prices will continue to edge up for a bit but not sure how US production will affect it. US shale output looks like it will rise steadily of course but OPEC and even the US companies who bought out the small shale companies have reason to look toward a longer goal and keep the prices edging up. I'm guessing stability will hold out relatively well through early Jan at least keeping the price in the mid 60s

This comes as Venezuela may default on its loans in a PDVSA/Rosneft deal which would give Russia’s Rosneft 49.9% ownership of PDVSA’s U.S. refining subsidiary Citgo. The U.S. has sanctioned 13 Venezuelan government officials, including officials with the PDVSA. There was backlash from U.S. refiners after initial talks of sanctions involved stopping imports of Venezuelan oil (third biggest supplier to the U.S.) - the American Fuel and Petroleum Manufacturers wrote a letter warning the Trump administration about how the sanctions “would disadvantage many U.S. refineries..” (https://www.platts.com/latest-news/oil/stpetersburg/venezuela-says-us-refiners-face-difficult-situation-26777599)"

So today, in Vienna, OPEC will try its luck again, extending output cuts, probably for another nine months. It’s unlikely to spark a big rally. Inventories may have peaked, but so has OPEC discipline: even if Iraq endorses a deal, it will probably cheat. Nigeria and Libya, both exempt from the cuts, are increasing production. And America’s shale output is surging. To push oil well above $50 a barrel, OPEC and non-OPEC suppliers would have to make more drastic cuts. Saudi Arabia has pledged to do “whatever it takes” to reduce stocks; it wants higher prices to support the forthcoming initial public offering of Aramco, the state-owned producer. It may also need to influence the futures markets so that shale producers stop hedging their output. OPEC needs crafty new tactics to beat the wily frackers"

However, I think 9 months is a long period where we could see compliance levels vary and OPEC member and non-member countries be eager to start producing at pre-agreement levels towards the end of an extension, as this extension allows the US to take more market share. There is the question of how willing the OPEC members are to extend for 9 months, as oppose to 6. “Iraq’s oil minister said his country could raise output to 5mb/d in the second half of 2017. By April, Baghdad had still not reduced its production to the agreed level.” (http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/15/rogue-opec-member-could-upset-russian-saudi-new-oil-order.html) It’s not surprising that Iraq hasn’t complied as they intially did not want to be part of the production cut due to the finance needed to fight ISIS. That being said; Khalid Al-Falih, Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, said “We think we have everybody on board. Everybody I’ve talked to indicated that nine months was a wise decision.” (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-19/opec-keeps-focus-on-shale-threat-as-officials-gather-in-vienna)"

OPEC wants to control the output however Iran will not play along simply because they have been out of sanctions not too long ago and will likely to catch up with the time loss so they will not stop pumping and not just Iran Venezuela is having the same problem as well so if there are majority countries which do not adhere to what the OPEC intends to do this output reduction will simply just be words no actions.
