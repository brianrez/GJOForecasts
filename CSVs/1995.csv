Bashar al-Assad just put his face on the currency. That doubles down (or quadruples down at this point) on the assertion that he's not interested in hosting UN-backed elections willingly. A negotiation that would bring on UN-backed elections seems unlikely now as Tillerson has signaled that the US will leave the Syrian negotiation in the hands of the Russians - and the Russians seem content with the status quo. I feel that the most likely route to UN-backed election is the ouster of Bashar al-Assad. There's a small chance of that as there's a lack of consensus in pursuing even among the Western countries."

A Russian general stated that the Syrian civil war is nearly over, but I take that to mean the Russians are doing well in the war. Syria was a Ba'ath party dictatorship before the civil war, with Bashar al-Assad as the leader. The Arab Spring was the match the lit the fire and led the country into civil war. Bashar al-Assad publicly states that he wants to return Syria to exactly the same state as before the Arab Spring. A dictatorship is the most that can be hoped for in many states of the world."

Syria held elections for Parliament in 2016 (next due in 2020) and for the President in 2014 (next due 2017). None of the current major outside actors (Russia, Iran and Turkey) that are involved in peace talks are that keen on totally free elections (they prefer elections where the government first chooses who is suitable to take part and then insures that the media feeds the voters the correct message) so I think they would be happy to take the view that Assad is already the legitimate president. Since the November 2015 UN-backed peace talks which called for new elections the world has moved on. The US influence in Syria has further declined and in any case the US will shortly have a President who believes that elections can be rigged, if they can be rigged in the US, why bother with elections in places like Syria where rigging elections goes without saying. The UN will probably become less concerned about elections because the balance of the Permanent Members of the Security Council is changing. China does not believe in elections at all, Russia believes in tightly controlled elections, the USA thinks elections are probably rigged, the UK is desperate to be friends with the US because it's no longer friends with EU countries, France could be the last liberal democracy left, or it could be run by another right wing realist who is friends with Russia."

If the civil war were over and Asad had won its unlikely that he would be willing to hold an election that would be considered free and fair by the western powers in the UN and so they would not back it. To hold a UN-backed election there would need to be peace and enough stability for candidates with differing views to be able to stand and campaign and for voters to be able to freely select who they wanted to vote for. None of the countries that support the Syrian government (Russia, Iran) hold totally and free and fair elections themselves so its unlikely that they would support UN-backed elections, unless it was the only option. It is just possible that the western powers would (via the UN) agree to elections that were not free and fair (i.e. managed, limited range of candidates etc.) in order to be able to wash their hands of the Syrian problem. This is more likely if Trump were to be US President and Le Pen were to be French President (populists tend to be more comfortable with non-democratic governments) - Russia and China clearly are not fans of free and fair elections and that makes 4 out of the 5 Permanent Members of the UN Security Council."

US and UN have no leverage we have been ""outplayed"" in a gray area again. See by analogy http://breakingdefense.com/2016/06/confronting-conflict-in-the-gray-zone/ Here is the direct passage http://strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/display.cfm?pubID=1325 ""RISK—HIGH, TRENDING MUCH HIGHER The United States has lost its decision-space-advantage in the MENA region. U.S. defense decision-making frames and processes are simply no match for MENA’s diverse security challenges and their profound complexity. The two features combined create an uncertain strategic planning environment that highlights in sharp relief the risk dilemmas presented by both action and inaction as they relate to the region. MENA is gray precisely because it is impossible to identify, focus on, and pace against a well-defined and manageable set of defense-relevant challenges. In MENA, the environment and the trends driving it are in fact the principal adversaries. Complexity in the MENA region means that any U.S. action has the potential to create even greater challenges for the United States and its partners. Further, the wide diversity of threat types makes first order prioritization challenging for senior decisionmakers. MENA boasts a potential nuclear power with a penchant for destabilizing regional proxy wars; a series of state-killing civil conflicts; myriad extremist groups that emerge from and thrive on endemic regional instability; and generalized rejectionist trends that fast undermine the authority and reach of even the region’s most capable states. Action against one or more of these will inevitably affect the nature and magnitude of risk associated with others. The 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq is the first of many clear examples in this regard. In large measure, there is an expert consensus that the United States is where it is in Iraq and Syria precisely because of the deliberate collapse of Saddam Hussein’s regime.197 On a smaller scale, Libya and Yemen also demonstrate the risk of U.S. action. In a desire to improve its position, U.S. actions contributed to a collapse of both Libya and Yemen. This collapse led to a security vacuum followed by rampant instability. A newfound U.S. Government appreciation of the risks of action have led it at times to embrace inaction or limited action in the region. In Syria, many perceive that U.S. inaction allowed the situation to worsen.198 Further, it opened new unhelpful operating space for U.S. adversaries. Russia and Iran, for example, are perceived to have seized on U.S. hesitation to more actively aid the Assad regime.199 Similarly, many argue that American passivity in the face of increasing violence and instability in Iraq between 2010-2014 highlight the hazards of inaction as well. During that period, a more assertive U.S. commitment may have limited ISIL operating space and prevented its de facto control over large areas of Iraqi territory. ( p.62)"

Assad and Russia seem to be aiming to keep ISIS in the field as a credible force in order to claim that the options are a win for ISIS or a win for Assad, and that an Assad win is better for the West than an ISIS win. I suspect ISIS is now much weaker than it appears and the US targeted attacks are having a big effect. In Iraq the in effective government could be on the point of changing. If the Iraq government does reform itself ISIS could be driven out of Iraq, which would leave it only in Syria. Then Assad and the Russian could not just ignore ISIS but would have to start attacking it. So by next year fighting could leave Syria divided into a government area and a Kurdish area with stalemate on the ground. At that point UN-backed elections might be a way out for Russia, Iran and the US."

I would be amazed if the correlation of power demonstrated by Iran and Russia , and Assad for the last 5 years changes. Add the lack of any organized opposition other than groups Nusra and Khorassan and YPG dominate what Assad does not. Free Syrian Army and intervention by other Sunni states not an option."

If the Bosnia model is adopted, there will be a Presidential Council with rotating chairpersons. I assume such a council would consist of Sunnis, Alawites, Kurds, Christains and Druze at the very least. It would be much more cumbersome in Syria than in Bosnia, and of course Assad would never agree to it and would have to be forcibly removed. But given the uncertainty after the Russian withdrawal, I think a solution of this kind might be proposed. How they would implement it is another question, so I'm not changing my forecast. However, I think it bears watching."

However, Russian military leaders, according to a recent ""60 Minutes"" interview, do not appear to back Assad as a permanent leader. Russia has a Navy base in Syria which is of great strategic interest to Russia's operations in the Mediterranean. An interesting analogy to this situation is how China is to North Korea as Russia is to Syria. Without the support of the superpower nation, the smaller nation is politically weakened. If Russia was offered to keep its naval assets in exchange for leaving the Ukraine as well helping to get Syria to have a UN backed election, this may work. Syria is a complex society. A little known fact is the word ""Christian"" originated in what is now Northern Syria, essentially the region of where Allepo is today. RECENT NEWS RELATING TO THE COMPLEXITY OF A FUTURE ELECTION On 2/15/2016, there was a conflict with the Syrian Kurds and Turkey. The Syrian Kurd YGP militia took over the Menagh air base in Syria after ISIS left. Their claim is that they re preventing ISIS from returning. Turkey claims that the Kurdish group are part of a larger terrorist group which plans to invade Turkey from its border with Turkey. Now there claims that this all because Turkey is backing ISIS. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/turkey-poised-battle-kurds-syrian-193645973.html;_ylt=A0LEVxqUV8JW2K8AkjVXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTEyNW84ODh0BGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDQjE1NjNfMQRzZWMDc2M- The ideal solution for the recent events in Syria is for the Kurds to have their own nation within the nations of Syria and Iraq, much like the Apache and Navajo Nations are nations within the states of Arizona and New Mexico. In terms of the election itself, a UN backed election is the best means for a resolution to a society of such diversity."

Yes, this is a very complex situation, but I believe there are several powerful underlying reasons why this will likely happen. Although Putin certainly has been toying with us and has no interest in supporting our interests, he has what I believe is a very strong desire to be viewed on the world stage as a first-world, global power broker (see all his current military actions), and that bringing Assad to the table would greatly inform this perception in his mind. Putin has also expressed willingness to bring opposition groups into the discussions. I suspect this is because he knows that he will be able to ensure that Assad can run in the election and likely is confident that he (and Assad) can control the election results in their favor. This is a win all around for Putin as he can ensure Assad remains in power and look like the global power broker (as he greatly desires) at the same time, all under the guise of a UN-backed free and open election. I believe that Putin is the most important figure in this situation, so for the reasons enumerated above, I believe it is more likely than not that the elections will occur by Jan 1, 2018, despite my personal lack of enthusiasm for the generally ineffectual United Nations. 75% chance it will happen, 25% it won't because the region is still highly volatile with many competing interests."
