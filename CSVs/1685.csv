The only way the repeal of estate tax could be in the bill on the desk of the President is that the House decides to go to conference and decide to pick fight with Senate on that particular issue. Although it is a red meat issue for Trump supporters, raising the threshold would drastically reduce the number of people affected, and the republican base will understand it as a defacto repeal in their mind. Even picking a fight with the Senate, the House would risk to jeopardize the entire tax bill, rendering its passage before Jan 1, 2018 impossible. Without cranking the numbers, I would say the chance remains 0%."

Even if the Trump tax bill passes, it would not fully repeal the estate tax until after 2024 and only immediately increase the taxable ceiling. However, I think that the question is asking something different: whether Trump will sign legislation that repeals the estate tax by the end of year. If that legislation immediately repeals the tax or does so with a sunset provision does not matter so long as it is signed. Interpreted in this way, the question is really “will Trump’s tax agenda pass before the end of the year” for which the odds are a lot better. The combination of the current momentum, having the passed the House, with the Republicans motivation to make it happen before Christmas makes it possible if not probable. Preliminary odds: 30%"

In the case of estate-tax repeal, the added government borrowing would more than outweigh any added private saving, leaving the economy no better off and quite possibly worse off. Gridlock when negotiating another crucial issue: the U.S. debt ceiling. That's the legal borrowing limit that must be raised or suspended this fall if the United States is to avoid a default on its debt. The debt ceiling is currently set at $19.8 trillion. Debt levels are near that cap and Treasury has begun using special accounting measures to keep outstanding debt just below the limit. But those measures are only expected to last until sometime this fall. At that point, if nothing is done, Treasury won't have enough cash and revenue on hand to pay all the country's bills in full and on time."

This is especially true if the Obamacare repeal passes Senate and Congress before congress has to approve FY 2018 budget. The 40% chance is not passing is also due to 1.the difficulty passing healthcare reform at the moment. If that fails before the end of July (50% chance), the chance of repealing estate tax decreases sharply, due to the coming FY 2018 budget fight in September. 2. the uncertainty surrounding Trump's campaign scandal. If there is breakthrough on the investigation, (very likely in 2 years, if distributed evenly there is a 25% chance it occurs in the next 6 months), it will likely disrupt the legislative agenda.

That’s about the same impact as lowering and rejiggering income brackets, but costs about one-sixth as much in lost revenue. But focusing on this issue will let Democrats raise issues of economic inequality. The tax, which applies to estates with assets of $5.49 million this year, affects about 5,000 estates. There is more bipartisan support for repealing the alternative minimum tax—a separate gauge of tax liability originally designed to keep the wealthy from avoiding paying their fair share but that now affects a broader swath of Americans. One potential obstacle to repeal: The AMT is forecast to bring in more than $350 billion in revenues from 2016 to 2025."
