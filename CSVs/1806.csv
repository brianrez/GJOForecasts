On the other hand, the fact that he is fairly old, has no recent political experience (vs diplomatic experience) and that he has been gone for 10 years sways me to lower that percentage some, because of these I would bump that percentage down to 70% Based on those points and some other varying analyses that I have run across I would about the benefit in delaying his announcement in order to stay out of the name calling, muck and mire that is associated with a political race (particularly a presidential one) and to keep his name separate from the current ruling party leader's name there would be more time to consider not running and retiring completely. Overal I'm gonna go with a 68%. Its rough analysis over a very cursory researching period. This will be updated as the time gets closer. January will be a telling month I think."
