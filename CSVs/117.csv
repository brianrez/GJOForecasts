Currently, Turkey and Hungary have not granted that consent. Hungary's parliment is meeting in mid-December to address the issue, and, while it's not impossible they will reject the proposal, they will likely approve the proposal then given that Hungary has given no public comment of concern. Turkey has voiced significant disagreement with Sweden joining NATO due to ""terrorism"" concerns (namely accusing Sweden of harboring Kurdish and Gulenist Turkish dissidents). Turkey is effectively asking for a significant quid-pro-quo for NATO membership by extraditing and prosecuting the Turkish governments perceived enemies. It is unlikely that Sweden will comply with these demands at the moment and will try to negotiate for more favorable concessions. Turkey has fewer demands from Finland which makes it more likely that Finland will join without Sweden. However, Finland and Sweden have pledged to join the military alliance together which reduces the chances that only one of the nations will join the bloc in 2022.The Far-right Sweden democrats now have a large say in Swedish government policy. They are more likely than the last government to assent to Turkish demands. but still not likely to hash out a new deal with Turkey this year."

Although the ratification of SV and FI goes smoothly so far, by average a member country needs about 25 days to ratify and deposit the documents (each country have different procedures but for those that have 2-3 levels of ratification, it would be by average 25 days calculated by the current process). As Turkey scheduled their assembly for October (unknown date), it would mean that in the most optimistic scenario they would vote for access in Oct and deposit their granted accession documents around november. Afterthat Finland must organize a quick vote (required by their law) and end Nov rather mid Dec the accession could take place. This, however, considering that Sweden would reach agreement with Turkey what is not the case so far. There is much that could go wrong, particularly in face of the current election in Sweden on 11/09 that can heavily impact the rythmus of negotiations with Turkey. One could expect that Erdogan will not be keen on giving up on any of his demands, presenting himself as a strong polititian in front of forthcoming election next year. Finland may try to negotiate alone, however, both,past accessions, and strong Finish-Swedish relatins does not let me think that their accession would split. Finland may possibly want to make it quicker only if forced (let it be a very unlikely direct attack from Russia on Finland or similar act of violence). Aditionally, I give a little probability that Turkey may want to be a swing player in Russian/Ukrainian/European relation using it at the end of the year. In fact around end of the year Putin used to create a gas crisis in the past, showing off his impact on Ukraine or other countries, it would not surprice me this year would happen something similar. Hence, I can imagine that in face of energetic threat from Russians, Erdogan may want to use the situation or even specifically play on time until end of the year in case Sweden would not agree to all his demands. He may assume that with change of context, he has more cards to play in the negotiations (specifically for Kakabave or others swedish citizens) - I would give 5% change for such scenario."

Given the speed with which applications have been reviewed and the relative strength of each country's application. I believe the most likely scenario sees both countries included within a relatively short time frame, virtually simultaneously. Each has strong defense capabilities, and complement each other in terms of location and logistics. Arguably, the clock is ticking, but personally I'd be curious to know what if anything Turkey stands to gain by prolonged resistance."

They will want concessions and NATO and the US will probably be willing to grant them. One question I have is the process for a country to be removed from NATO. It Turkey is relying on Russian weapons and holding out on Finland and Sweden are they a good NATO partner?

It is hard to see how everything could be arranged so quickly compared to the base rate, even without Turkey’s intransigence. With that obstruction, it seems almost certain to be well into 2023 or even 2024 before they become members."
