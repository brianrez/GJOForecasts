So; Outside View: Regarding the possibility of MBS becoming king due to the death or incapacitation of his father--- King Salman is 84, has dementia, and had gallbladder surgery in July, although he seems to have recovered from that and there don’t appear to be any new reports of adverse health of the king. @jtrusz had a good outside view analysis of the general stats regarding longevity of the Saudi male population, the typical length of a monarch’s reign, etc… following that analysis, I’d say that it seems not likely that the king would die or hand over power in the next 6 weeks. Some teammates wondered if the King could die of COVID. I assume that the King lives in a pretty protected bubble, so I doubt that he’d be likely to catch it. If he did catch it, though, according to my research he could die from it in as little as 2 weeks, given his age. So in other words between now and Dec 1 would be enough of a time window for Covid to kill the king--- assuming he caught it in the first place. Inside View: On the question of whether MBS might try to overthrow his father--- A classmate who is a Saudi national remarked that there has never been a coup in Saudi Arabia, and it is “culturally inconceivable” for a son to usurp a father. So unless MBS is willing to break some very strong cultural norms (and some would say he already has), seems unlikely that he would brazenly grab power from his father in a coup-like scenario. This classmate predicts that MBS will stay Crown Prince because things are going well in the country, and a coup is unlikely especially if there is stability and prosperity in Saudi. Here is an analysis from a State Department colleague who is an expert on the Mid East: “There was some speculation earlier in the year that MBS was clearing the decks (eg detaining/sacking royal family rivals and critics) to accede to the throne around the G20 Summit later this year: (https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/exclusive-saudi-crown-prince-plans-become-king-novembers-g20-summit)."

Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy that does not tolerate any political opposition, but the formation of the National Assembly Party on the anniversary of the kingdom’s founding comes amid a growing state crackdown on dissent and freedom of expression. [...] Saudi Arabia has long faced international criticism over its human rights record. That has intensified since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was named heir to the Saudi throne in June 2017. In particular, the grizly October 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul sparked unprecedented international scrutiny of the kingdom’s human rights record. The global fallout over the murder tarnished the crown prince’s carefully cultivated reputation as a reformer, casting a shadow over his ambitious attempts to modernise the conservative kingdom’s economy and society. In a radical makeover of the kingdom, the 35-year-old Prince Mohammed clipped the powers of the once-feared clerical establishment, lifted the world’s only ban on women drivers, reopened cinemas and allowed mixed-gender entertainment. But the social reforms have been in lockstep with political repression, party members said. The party’s creation is a “very long overdue move”, said Alaoudh, whose father Salman al-Awda, a religious cleric, faces the death penalty after he was arrested in September 2017. The party seeks to protect the country from “upheaval and absolute dictatorship and pave the way for democracy in a peaceful transition,“ Alaoudh told AFP. — AFP"""
