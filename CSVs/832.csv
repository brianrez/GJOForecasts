Solar PV defied even exponential models and there is quite a high likelihood EVs will too. The only things that could slow down deployment of fast chargers would be either permitting processes which is a real concern and/or grid congestion (e.g. the acute shortage of electricity in Stockholm). That said, there are many countries in EU where there are comparatively very few charging outlets and these constraining factors will only be an issue in a few, select regions. Moreover, fast chargers are ususally located along high-ways and other infrastructure which both means the grid is less congested and permitting should be easier. I am inclined to actually revise to 100% but that feels perhaps a bit over confident but would be aligned with a >0.5% chance of ending up below 40k. I wished the question poser would have used evidence from cost declines in renewables to understand that she or he should have widened this range dramatically. I think there is a chance we will blow way past 50k and might end up perhaps somewhere near 70k. Chance of that? Perhaps 5%. Sad that this cannot be captured by the way the question is set up. Maybe I should pose the same question but with wider ranges?"

My previous estimate that people wouldn't be interested in excessive amounts of available fast charging still exists, but >22kW isn't too powerful and there is enough interest from industry discussions. Certainly, I think the limiting factor [for this question] will now be the construction speeds and electricity networks, which should comfortably be able to tackle 40,000."
