Also seems that Pompeo is chasing them to meet Kim again before that-- in August -- despite that Pompeo was trashed and labeled as gangster-ish in his last meeting.

Trump makes it easy for them to fill in the void of leadership. That's why I believe they will both show up in Pyongyang in September. Trade war with China bolters the argument.

But Seoul, wary of Pyongyang taking advantage of the summit for domestic propaganda, preferred to hold it just before the start of the United Nations General Assembly on Sept 18, he added. ...The delegations also discussed ""further methods to fulfil the Declaration in a sincere manner"", said a joint statement. South Korea's Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon, who led the talks with North Korea's chief delegate Ri Son Gwon, said that Pyongyang was asked to speed up nuclear disarmament talks, to which it replied that it was ""pushing forward with steps agreed to with the United States"". ...Pressure has been mounting on Seoul to play a more active role in mediating between Pyongyang and Washington, after denuclearisation talks hit a stalemate following the Trump-Kim summit in Singapore on June 12. Dr Park said: ""There is pressure from the US to press North Korea to give up nuclear weapons, but the progressive Moon Jae-in government is friendly towards the North and has little intention to pressure them."" He added that while Mr Trump has so far been patient with Mr Kim, ""it will be disastrous for North Korea if Trump changes his mind and starts doubting North Korea's intentions."" https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/third-moon-kim-summit-set-for-next-month"

The threat of an atomic attack seems to be greatly diminished - at least for now! (ii) More importantly, the President of North Korea is no longer viewed as an an irrational monster who will destroy everything on a whim.
