M5S's anti establishment populist identity and message appeals successfully to eurosceptics, and a youthful, disenfranchised population. However the political culture and nature of politics in Italy ultimately necessitates and encourages coalition formation. It seems that M5S has painted itself into a corner with its message eventhough Luigi Di Maio is putting forth a slicker and slightly more moderate image. The only problem is this message may start overlapping with the right-wing Forza, League and a potential centrist PD coalition who have more regional ties and historically a more persistent culturally ingrained message. Berlusconi, a master at coalition formation, will absorb centrists falling away from the PD coalition. M5S is doing well in the national polling however, the new election law allows only one pick on each ballot. It is quite possible that people with regional interests will forgo the M5S candidate and stay with their regional alliances. M5S will not live up to expectations in the first-past-the-post ballot. If M5S starts polling a few points over 32% I will have to think about revising upward but I think that any coalition Berlusconi creates will prevail in the elections and capture the largest segment of the population which is between the ages of 40 and 54.

Using the cube rule, the FPTP seats should be 63 for their current polling of 28%. Given that a simulation online gives 46 FPTP seats, they are clearly unfavourably distributed. But taking a simple multiplier as a first approximation of this bad distribution, this gives 31-88 FPTP seats in this same range, giving a total of 131-207 seats. So it is clear high probability should go the 88-200 range, but allowance should be made for late polling shifts and the uncertainty inherent in a new system with majoritarian aspects."

Scenario 1 - M5S if forming a coalition might as well form a coalition with one of the larger parties to at least get majority of votes and be included in gorvernment formation. Scenario 2 - This as I said is highly unlikely as it would have two unlikely events co-inciding - more than 90% of all votes cast during elections divided between two parties (M5S and a rival party most likely PD) and M5S not loosing to that rival party in vote count.
