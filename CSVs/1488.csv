Recent world events have shown that Russia has a strong influence on geopolitical events and can exert power to influence situations in her national interest. The Russian economy has recovered to some extent from international sanctions and has proven to be resilient against external forces. Russia has been able to effectively bolster the regime of Bashar Al-Assad against the wishes of Western governments. The annexation of Crimea was also a success for Russia as Western response has been weak. Russian foreign policy and military strategy is highly lateral and of an asymmetric nature. The Soviet concept of Maskirovka is highly effective. Russia is once again a great world power and the unipolar world of the post Soviet era has come to an end, with Russia, USA and China formking a troika of sorts."
