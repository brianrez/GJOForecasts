At the minimum, the City Council will have to agree, and perhaps the financial backing has to be secured (although one imagines this can also be done after the IOC's Sep 13 decision). Moreover, there might be political costs for Garcetti giving up 2024 without a fight. Some influential Angelenos may well prefer to fight for 2024 now (despite the slim chance) and, if they lose, apply for 2028 afterwards. Given that the infrastructure is largely in place, the cost of waiting is pretty low."
