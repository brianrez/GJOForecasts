Additionally, CDC data suggests that the country has experienced an average of 293,946 cases per week. Using the CDC figure would leave us at 1,175,784 cases in the next week. This same time last year, the United States saw a total of 2,509,456 cases. When you consider the creation and widespread distribution of booster shots, it’s highly unlikely that we see more than 2.25M cases in the next month, which is what led me to assigning fairly low probabilities to events F, G, and H. I assigned relatively low probabilities to events A and B for similar reasons. Lastly, the frequency with which folks are currently testing relative to last year’s frequency is much lower, which will likely lead to fewer reported cases."

While the peak number of cases occurred in January at 5,589,000, this spike was far outside the normal range over the past two years. Looking at last year's trend, we can see that the rate for the same week in 2021 was 505,000, with a similar dip into October and a rise after November. However, the minimum point in October 2021 was 250k cases higher than this October. Based on these trends and last year's data point, I think there is a high likelihood that the number of COVID cases will stay under 1,000,000, with a slightly higher probability of remaining under 500,000."

Fall usually brings an increase in the number of cases and it seems like the US has not yet had its mini-wave of the new variants (e.g., BA.4.6) that recently caused an increase in cases in Europe. As a result, I'm leaning towards 1.1m as a likely lower bound and 2.5m (last year's numbers) as a strict upper bound as I don't expect things to go worse than 2021 (it didn't in Europe)."

But what is useful from that period are the growth rates of new cases (-5.3%, -0.2%, 6.8%, 14.2%, and 8.9%). This trend suggests that cases will initially decline at a slower rate before increasing as we move from late October into November. Next, I took those rates mentioned above and created growth rate ranges to use in a simulation over 100 potential outcomes. I used the average of the 100 simulations for each week to derive weekly case totals and rolling four-week totals."

With this in mind, I weighted Answer F higher than any other option. I weighted Answer E with the second highest probability because I think vaccines will lower the overall new cases and the trend from 2020 to 2021 showed a decrease as well."
