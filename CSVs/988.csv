The figure will be the ratio vs the CPI a year ago, which was particularly high in june 19. As a consequence, we will ""observe"" a very low number, possibly negative, even if the prices remain flat versus the month of May. My guess: CPI flat vs May, means 0.1% decrease. Thus more weight on negative than positive. I don't see much signs of increasing prices or strong decreases compared to last month: covid situation is stabilizing and markets opening again. That adds a bit of chance to an increase. Final choice a 55-55 instead of a 60-40. No strong rational for the %. I think we are going to be very close to the border of the two answers."

The only time inflation has dipped below 0 in the last quarter century was in 2014, when energy prices dropped precipitously. This was accompanied by a 5% drop in year-on-year output. FT reports that economic malaise in the Eurozone is starting to lift (https://www.ft.com/content/8ffb5d91-074b-4fd2-8b74-bfbbb60750e7), with growth slowing but output still higher than last year. For the past 4-5 years, Euro inflation has sat comfortably between 1 and 2%, and has only this month dropped below 1. So I'd say it's about even odds that it'll sit on either side of 1, with a slight boost for above, given reversion to the mean and the FT's apparent evidence of improved economic prospects."

The inflation rate seems to be on a downward trend for the last few months, and given the timeframe of the question I think at this stage it is reasonable to assume that this trend will continue. Measures that could be used by the ECB to bring inflation closer to their target value of close to 2% such as more negative interest rates or more asset purchasing programs seem to become less and less popular with both the public and the committee members at the ECB. In addition it seems that these tools don't have the effect on inflation they used to have, requiring some adjustment of the narrative or a change of approach altogether. I therefore increase the probability of the second lowest bucket from the base rate at the expense of higher inflation buckets."
