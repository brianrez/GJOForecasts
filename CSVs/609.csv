With these variables and complexities at play, it makes the prospects of a US-Sino trade deal to come about within 6 months of Biden taking office even more remote."

China has moved at the speed of light to exercise its leadership power, there is only one way to level the playing field with China and that requires alliances, thus more time to frame and apply."
