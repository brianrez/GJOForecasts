(http://www.fta.gov.sg/press_release%5CFACTSHEET%20ON%20RCEP_final.pdf ). The completion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership has increased pressure to finalize the deal (http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/14/tpp-deal-pressures-rcep-trade-talks-in-busan-china-keen-for-progress.html ). Resolution requires that the negotiators reach an agreement. Ratification by the parties to the agreement is not required.,https://www.gjopen.com/questions/66-will-negotiations-on-the-regional-comprehensive-economic-partnership-rcep-be-completed-before-1-january-2016

I agree that they would _like_ to complete this according to 2015 schedule, however there are some mitigating circumstances. First, TPP was putting pressure on ASEAN to complete this agreement. But, within TPP member countries, TPP seems to be dead in the water. Additionally, meeting locations have been released for RCEP next year. (http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/rcep-set-to-miss-2015-deadline-talks-to-spill-over-to-next-year/articleshow/49499225.cms This link is stale relative to Rodney's, but still ...) I have increased my probability because I think the RCEP negotiators are watching the reception TPP is going to receive."
