While there is a current uproar about the UK's role in the situation in Afghanistan, it does not appear to be targeted directly at Boris beyond the fact that he was on holiday during the events and did not recall parliament before the fall of Kabul. Dominic Raab has taken at least as much flack. Boris can, at the very least, extend his stay in number 10 with his cabinet reshuffle that will give the impression of doing something. The current crisis in Afghanistan aside, Boris' ratings have taken a big dip but he still remains preferred to Keir Starmer as PM by the British public. Likewise, the conservatives are still ahead in the Westminster voting intention polls. With no conservative MP likely to be able to brand themselves as a better election winner than Boris, it seems extremely unlikely that Boris will cease to be PM in the near future."

He also, to the chagrin of those still fighting the Remain war, was true to his word and achieved Brexit. The voters in those Red Wall areas voted to regain sovereignty from the EU and Boris has gained credit from that. The BBC, ITV and press media have created the current furore over wallpaper and things said in frustration/anger, but polls with these organisations have shown the people only care about vaccinations and the return of normal life/ economy, not what Carrie is spending. Blair spent considerably more (70 pounds per roll of wallpaper in 2002) of taxpayer’s money on renovating Downing Street. As long as he maintains his and his party’s popularity ratings, the backbenchers will support him. If he loses them, he is toast.

For example, Anthony Eden resigned after Suez, Margaret Thatcher resigned after a challenge was launched against her leadership, Cameron resigned after holding a Brexit referendum with an exit result, Major was damaged by his EU policy, and sleaze issues and that’s just the conservatives; Labour is a bit less ruthless and a different process. The last two years have included Brexit and a global pandemic where normal results and outcomes have been turned upside down plus the lack of an effective opposition to hold the government to account. My rationale is look at current and future events and consider the ‘known and unknown knowns’ (Rumsfeld) and events. If it continues to go well, I reduce the % chance of Boris’s demise, maybe 0%. Two events that have the potential to disrupt the going well would be an EU trade war (vaccines, financial and goods) and the Scottish push for independence. One last point is how much of a conservative is the libertarian Boris Johnson and do his colleagues trust him?"

The EU commission led by Ursula von der Leyen has shown itself to be inept in obtaining the amount of vaccinations for its citizens and its capability to break the NI treaty and contract law to stop the export of contracted supplies. In the short term, this has shown that the perception by the UK Government, led by Boris Johnson, to have made the right decision in leaving the single market and its lamentable, business/procurement methods. The next issue to be faced by Boris Johnson is the demand of the SNP to gain a second independence referendum. He believes in the Union albeit he is not popular in Scotland and the Conservatives (or Labour) look unlikely to win anything north of the border. According to the polls Scottish are +/- 50% to vote yes/No for independence, but it appears that a vote in England for the same would be to vote for Scottish independence. So, this, if true, should not affect Boris’s popularity. The third issue and potential danger for Boris is his party’s backbenchers who do have the form and capability to unseat their leader if ideology is transcended; there have been rumbles of discontent over lack of basic freedoms due the duration of pandemic lockdown by politicians and media commentators. Early days though. He has been fortunate in having an ineffectual opposition in Westminster. The Arcuri affair has probably been baked in. I am going to increase his % survival chances due to his success rate concerning Brexit, December 2020 general election and the vaccination dividend."

The handling of the pandemic doesn't seem to have significantly hurt his position yet and he has a very large majority. -Getting rid of Dominic Cummings and replacement with a Dan Rosenfield indicates a commitment to a perhaps more cautious approach. Cummings was reported not to be popular with many Tory MPs (demonstrated by many openly calling for him to go over Barnard Castle incident). -There is a small chance that he could do something really silly, or the situation with COVID could take a turn for the worst, but Boris' position through 2021 seems otherwise pretty stable."

I imagine the Scottish election results will not go the way as SNP planed, largely in part to there incompetent handling of the pandemic. Brexit success is unlikely, as the long term benefits are unlikely to be felt in short time period. Instead i imagine the sharp hike in food prices will have subsided within a few months as people adapt. He may have concerns from his ever growing backbench list of MPs who are dismayed by his handling of the cornavirus. However, As we get out of a crisis situation, I think the conservatives on the whole would like to see Boris in a situation in which he excels in. As something of a mascot for British people. WIth the UN summit and Olympic Games (dont brush aside what a good medal haul will have on the mood of the country) coming up, these are sort of environments in which the British people can get behind him."

As @Mark_T points out, the ultimate decision will be made by the Tory party. If no-deal Brexit bites hard, Mr. Johnson's position within the party may become less secure, especially if his cohort of (largely) poorly qualified Brexiteers cabinet members are unable to stabilise the economy.

Thus, for the next 12-24 months, it is unlikely Labour can regenerate their previous standing amongst the Red Wall voters. Johnson plans to amend the Fixed Term Parliament Act which would then give the Prime Minister, flexibility to call an election early. That's not likely in the next 12-24 months under Johnson's current term. That suggests that if he is to be unseated, it would be an internal Tory putsch. 10 months is a long time in UK politics and many changes can occur in the time frame of the question. Shorter term, a Brexit that meets the expectations of the Red Wall voters and the 52% 'leavers' and a successful Covid-19 vaccination program between now and spring are Johnson's guiding beacons to stay in office."

A prime minister assignment can normally last for a period of 5 years (the length between each parliament regular election since 2011), unless he/she faces political turmoil and has to be replaced by his/her party (who holds the majority in the parliament), or, unless for some reasons, new elections are decided earlier than normal. To my knowledge (that's the critical point, I don't know much about UK's domestic politics), there's no valid reason for Boris Johnson to resign and ask for dissolution of parliament before the official term, May 2024 (last election was held in Dec. 2019 https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/elections-and-voting/general/), nor any reasons for the parliament to vote and ask to cast new elections earlier than ""normal"". B J still has relative support from his party and it seems that the crucial negotiations for leaving the EU once and for all (which is to me carrying the highest risk of terminating his term) will find a conclusion anyhow by the end of 2020. I believe that whatever the results, it will not be blamed on him or his government. EU will likely be the one to blame if the result is not satisfactory (classic political demagogy and scapegoating). Therefore, I find no reasons for B J to stop being prime minister before 18 Sept 2021."

As for a baseline, I don't think it reasonable to compare time in office without considering the variables of the time (i.e. just because past PM's have spent more than or less than 787 days in office indicates the probability that Johnson will or will not). So considering the two main events in Johnson's PM career (BREXIT and COVID), I think there is a likelihood he will remain in his position through 18 Sep 2021, with a slight chance of unforeseen circumstances (i.e. natural death)."

Confidence motions appear rare, and for it to happen successfully there would have to be enough dissenters in the majority. I'm not very familiar with UK politics but it would be surprising for the majority to dissolve itself in calling for an election. Polling shows labour gaining on the conservatives so even more reason to not call for elections. But on the other hand the polls are narrowing, so there's always the chance that labour manages to get a snap election called.

The average amount of time a government lasts is either 3.7 or 4.1 years (2) (the current government having been in place since December, so 9 months). Johnson has been PM since July of last year. The fixed term parliament act is still currently in effect so there will not be a election until 2024 unless Parliament dissolves before then. Johnson is 56, so has a less than 1% chance of death in the next year. The current majority in the Commons is 80, which is a large majority, and many of his MPs owe their seats to him. He can happily suffer a few cabinet resignations and still command the strength of the party."

Whether anyone else agrees with it or not is immaterial. He wants to get through what are viewed as 'temporary setbacks': Covid 19, the reluctance of the EU to accept his terms on Brexit, the fury now raised in Ireland as they realise they cannot change his position on Brexit and the consequent hurt to them, the frightening wilfulness of D Cummings and the country's reaction to that. If he can survive all of that he has longer term plans that he wants to see through to finalisation and with his current majority he can do that. Scotland is an outlying issue -for now. He has responded with a determined 'no' to another referendum but that may not be a tenable position if enough Scots demand it."

What will the future of the NHS or the construction industry in Britain look like without Hungarian nurses and bricklayers from Poland? In any upcoming by-election the Tories will be stripped to their shirt, and the economic model of the UK, which footed on the price inflation of the London commercial real estate market, the financial sector, being a domicile for continental European tax evaders and the income transferred from the sale of Scottish Brent crude, will just implode within six months or less. He will lose his party's support pretty quickly, since ordinary people with no Oxford debate club-background will be quite angry at him trying to sell this once-in-a-lifetime catastrophe as a big victory. He will have much time at home with the kid and girlfriend, and happily pay a visit to Theresa May for a five o'clock tea and a round of bridge in one of their country houses once in a while, for old times' sake .
