Looking back at the index, it really does appear that the faster (steeper) the change, the more the index tends to be decoupled from and to lag the MSP and to take a little time to come back in sync with it. This is a tricky, unprecedented situation that does not easily lend itself to various modeling methods. Thanks to @JonathanMann, @BayesianChimp, and @erikbays for very useful discussions."

So kudos to @belikewater who came in much closer than me on this per our discussion the other day. Rerunning my 4cast using Winter's Method I obtain results that imply an increased probability for Bin4, so I'm changing my forecast. I went back to the FRED MSP data and found a longer time series dataset for regression, but have abandoned this because of the strong seasonal component in the MSP that increases the error variance in the regression against CSHPI. If I run 3 month moving averages of the MSP I definitely see a slow down there as noted by @JonathanMann. So taking that into account I end up with a slight bias towards Bin4 over Bin3."

Here are my calculations: The three-month average for August was 360000 which when multiplied by my prediction parameter (""0.000742"") would have yielded ""267.12"". Adjusting this parameter to ""0.000745"" would have yielded ""268.2"", still slightly low, but that's as far as I'm willing to move it based on a single observation. With these adjustments in place, the three-month average for September (356,667) multiplied by the ""0.000745"" parameter yields ""265.72"". We don't have the median sales price data for October yet, but given the seasonal trends and looking at the past few months, I think it's reasonable to predict that it will be lower than September. With that said, I'll use the September number for October for now. Based on the stated assumptions, the three-month average for October becomes 354,433. When it is multiplied by the ""0.000745"" parameter, it yields ""264.05"". Of course, there is a pretty wide range of variation around these estimates, but it appears that we're still most likely to end up in bin 3. Given the fact that @belikewater 's estimates for August were closer than mine though, I'm going to have to update slightly toward his forecast. @LokiOdinevich , @elifland - Any thoughts?

List prices in this data set do not map exactly to FRED, but this method would put the target FRED number for August / September closer ~262 (about this same level as June), but with a fair amount of wiggle room. Add on to that the fact that October could take another step down and the 250 - 260 bucket looks very possible.

The Index has a seasonal trend of enhanced increases from March through July that start to taper off in August and declines after that, until the following March. This trend is superimposed on overall growth of the index and can be seen even in 2020 and 2021, except that growth didn't decline at the end of the summer in 2020. Will we see a decline in growth through the end of summer in 2021? One factor in favor of a decline in growth is that the economy is gradually returning to pre-pandemic activities; one factor against this is that new housing construction has faced shortages, and these bottlenecks may push more people into purchasing existing housing stock who would otherwise have purchased new homes. (No new homes are included in this Index.) This feels like a bubble that will gradually pop as people have to go back to the office and won't want to commute to their suburban dream houses. But I don't think the bubble is likely to pop before October, especially as a lot of people continue to telecommute and high levels of Covid spread continue. And also, there is generally a housing crisis in the US, so in the end, maybe it will simply be a gradual slide rather than pop. Also, the median home sale price is starting to plateau (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS), which can be a leading indicator for the forecast Index (see, e.g., 2005). A risk to consider is that we'll see a decline in the median home sale price for Q3 like that seen in Q3 of 2006; this corresponded to a fall of about half a point in the forecast index. However, as the median home sale price grew ~5% for July, I don't think a substantial decline in the median home sale price for Q3 or any decline in the forecast index is likely in the forecast period. But it is clear that the housing market is approaching some kind of peak. So I'll expect another month of growth of ~5 pts/month for July, followed by a bit less growth in August and a little less in September and October, but I'll allow for the possibility that growth will continue at existing levels for July through October. Looking at 2020, I don't think avg growth >5 pts/month is out of the question, but I don't think 2021 will be like 2020 because the median home sale price was exploding in Q3 2020 but is starting to plateau now. Possible outcomes are constrained by time at this point. Only 4 months of data remaining in the forecast.

I'm more convinced that there are some reasons to expect growth in the index to slow down from the last year/ few months. COVID may have contributed a lot to the consistent large increase and as COVID restrictions wind down , inflation decreases and the eviction moratorium ends, the index might not increase by as much. 2. But, if inflation is causing some of the recent rapid increases, inflation was high (0.9%) in June: https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf."

It probably won't be too large, though, because many people have been able to restructure their mortgages. How high can this go? It feels like a bubble that will pop when people have to go back to the office, and suddenly no one will want to commute to their suburban dream houses. But I don't think the bubble is likely to pop before October. Growth rate for remaining 5 months, index value: 1, 259.92 2, 264.92 3, 269.92 4, 274.92 5, 279.92 I can't picture growth staying as high as 5 pts/month for the remainder of the forecast period, but 280+ shouldn't be ruled out at this point. Also, the median home sale price is plateauing (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS), which can be a leading indicator (see, e.g., 2005). Still, it seems like any peak or plateau is likely still a few months away. If this is true, then bins 1 and 2 would be unlikely."

Home prices really jumped up, and I've heard much of the reason for that is that the supply of houses on the market cratered. Checking out some data on that [1] it looks like that's exactly right. Housing supply cratered in late spring/early summer 2020. That coincides with the beginning of the above-trend increase in housing prices according to the Case-Shiller metric [2]. As shown in [1], as of May the housing supply is back into the territory from before the pandemic. So I think it's likely that prices level off or return to trend soon. High prices incentivize home-owners to get their houses on the market and they also disincentivize buyers from buying at outrageous prices, and both these factors will put downward pressure on home prices."
