"Between 12 August 2016 and the end of 2016, will any US state enact legislation that allows autonomous vehicles to operate on its public roads?",2016-08-12T17:00:33Z,2016-09-29T17:00:43Z,Yes,"['Yes', 'No']","['Technology', 'Economic Policy', 'US Policy']",499,654,249,237,"This question was closed on option A with a closing date of 9/29/2016. On 29 September 2016, California's governor signed a bill into law which permits the use of autonomous vehicles on some state roads (Road & Track, East County Today, California Legislative Information). Most states neither explicitly allow nor explicitly ban the operation of autonomous vehicles on public roads, making such vehicles de facto legal (Washington Post). However, several states are considering legislation that would explicitly allow autonomous vehicles to operate on public roads (National Conference of State Legislatures, The Center for Internet and Society). Autonomous vehicles are those that can operate without the active control or monitoring of a human driver, at least under some conditions. This does not refer to cars with regular features such as adaptive cruise control, lane assist, crash avoidance, emergency braking, and other technology unless those features allow a driver to cede all control and monitoring. Any legislation enacted allowing autonomous vehicles on public roads will resolve the question as ""yes,"" even if the legislation places restrictions on those autonomous vehicles (e.g., by limiting operation to certain roads or conditions, or only allowing operation for the purposes of research or testing). Recommended Questions Will Tesla Motors deliver more than 80,000 BEVs to customers in calendar year 2016? Will the 2016 industry-wide average cost of Li-on batteries used in battery-powered electric vehicles be less than $300 per kWh? When will Tesla release a software update that adds off-ramp capabilities to its Autopilot system?",https://www.gjopen.com/questions/261-between-12-august-2016-and-the-end-of-2016-will-any-us-state-enact-legislation-that-allows-autonomous-vehicles-to-operate-on-its-public-roads

As an alternative to the GovTrack analysis methodology, I calculated speed of bill passing between different instances (i.e. from proposal to committee to assembly to each of the senate readings) giving it a weight when compared to historical averages. Then calculated percentage of Ayes and Noes in voting for passing each committee instance and also assigned weight compared to average. I used these weights to project future legislative time for each bill and compared it to remaining legislative times for each state, (deducing 15% for being electoral year). Did some more calculations, including a framework for comparing corporate liquidity (cash on hand) of companies interested in testing against State government S&P ratings, but I don't have the time to explain now. https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billHistoryClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1592"

Similar efforts could be made from ""Rust belt"" states who want a free way to get a leg up on investment (They don't need to invest any state budget, just pass legislation), and such a movement with support in the polls could be rushed through quite rapidly.

Five qualifying bills are currently on the table and are going through the committee process, so there is a 75% chance that at least one of these bills should be enacted. I will use 75% as my baseline. The median time for a bill to become law is 215 days, but there are only about 140 days left in the year. These numbers are at the federal level, so I will assume the median time is shorter at the state level since the respective state congresses have slightly less partisan resistance. As others have stated, most states are already finished with the year's legislative sessions so the effective remaining time to enact any of these laws is closer to 30 days. I do not know when each of the bills was first introduced so I will assume they are already on average 40 days old considering where they are in the legislative process. Forecast reduced to 40%. Considering this is election season for many congressman, I do not expect this issue to be at the top of most agendas so that could lower the likelihood of being enacted. Forecast reduced to 35%. There is always the possibility of a bill being introduced in a special session or an amendment added to another bill. While this is unlikely, it can only increase the chances. Forecast increased to 37%. The recent headline-making death of a ""driver"" of an autonomous vehicle may be polarizing in making politicians hesitant to enact these laws. Forecast reduced to 22%. Since Tesla is at the forefront of this area and its headquarters are located in California, I could see the California legislation having slightly more incentive to pass their bill, even if to just allow testing on public roads. Forecast increased to 27%."

I know from participation in an autonomous vehicle research group, that these issues have been worked through over the last several years. Some locations already have laws clarifying liability issues, and those existing laws can serve as models for other locations. Restrictions to certain roads partially answers the infrastructure problem, and is more likely to be a solution for the next several years. While manufacturers would like broader road access, municipalities are more likely to move slowly. We are more likely to see city by city approvals, and only wider access upon successful operation. This is definitely the future direction, though roll-out will be cautious."
