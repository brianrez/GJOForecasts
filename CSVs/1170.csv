As such I develop a bias that is harder to shake with new data that should sway me. Citgo is a refiner. The refining business is very, very stable. Fuel consumption is very predictable, storage is stable, transport costs are predictable. The business side of this question has no indicators of large uncertainty or surprise costs. There have been floods that may or may not have affected the business, but that isn't why this question was proposed, It is because of the Venezuelan sanctions, as Citgo is wholly owned by the government of Venezuela. In March, 2019 the US Treasury took the unusual steps to refinance Citgo to keep those American jobs.

This average is the lowest level since January 2003, when a nationwide strike and civil unrest largely brought Venezuela's state oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A.'s (PdVSA), operations to a halt. Widespread power outages, mismanagement of the country's oil industry, and U.S. sanctions directed at Venezuela's energy sector and PdVSA have all contributed to the recent declines. Venezuela's production decreased by an average of 33,000 b/d each month in 2018, and the rate of decline accelerated to an average of over 135,000 b/d per month in the first quarter of 2019. The number of active oil rigs—an indicator of future oil production—also fell from nearly 70 rigs in the first quarter of 2016 to 24 rigs in the first quarter of 2019. The declines in Venezuelan production will have limited effects on the United States, as U.S. imports of Venezuelan crude oil have decreased over the last several years, with average 2018 imports the lowest since 1989. However, there may be upward pressure on the prices of other crude oils imported into the United States."

The subsidiary's financial performance and funding prospects are highly independent from those of the group, so that even if other core entities encounter severe setbacks, the relative strength of the subsidiary will remain nearly intact. The subsidiary is severable from the group and able to stand on its own or subcontract certain functions previously provided by the parent. The parent's strategy with respect to the subsidiary is clear and, in particular, the parent has a compelling economic incentive to preserve the subsidiary's credit strength; and it is unlikely that the subsidiary will be drawn into bankruptcy proceedings at the group level that would lead to a default on the subsidiary's obligations."

CITGO has been challenged in the past as alter ego of PDVSA in other litigations. There could also be a motivation for Maduro to default, the $1.5B loan from Rosneft, backed with 49.9% of CITGO as collateral to give half of the company to his friend and supporter Putin.
