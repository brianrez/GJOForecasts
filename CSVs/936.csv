Last October France led a group of countries that prevented this, but adjustments to the accession process have satisfied them that it can now go ahead. More delays are possible. The European Commission first recommended that North Macedonia begin talks 11 years ago. Albania’s green light will come with all sorts of conditions. On March 17th Aleksandar Vucic, the president of Serbia, the biggest of the six western Balkan countries hoping to join the EU, lambasted the bloc for its lack of help with the spread of covid-19 and appealed to “our Chinese brothers” instead. European solidarity was just a “fairy tale”, he claimed. The challenge for the EU is to breathe life back into the accession process—and not let it wither and die, as has happened with Turkey.”"

Albania's corruption issues have of course long been well-known, for all that the Commission tries to gloss over them. These two countries have always been considered together, but from the perspective of member states, it's not obvious why they should be, and I think to enlargement skeptics (like France) then North Macedonia probably looks like a much more credible European partner at this point in time, as well as a nation less likely to lead to another deeply unpopular wave of westward migration (as happened when Bulgaria and Romania joined."

Because all countries need to approve, Macron's veto is enough for the talks to never go anywhere, - he may eventually give in to pressure from others in the EU who fear that these countries will stray from European values and interests, but I think countries like Finland and others that want to cut on EU spending can also stop it from happening. In March, if there's a positive report on these countries, then the chances of (any) yes do increase."

France's does not public declare opposition to specific countries, they just seem to not want to grant access at all. Given how long this process takes from negotiations to becoming a member, I think France will not want to take too great a hit surrounding this. However, the EU is somewhat fragile, so there may be general pushback. However, I think either both get moved to negotiations or neither. None of the push-back seems particular to one country."
