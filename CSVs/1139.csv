73156,2019-05-12T16:13:35Z,1,[53.0],[53.0],"Most recent Ipsos polling in France shows National Rally slightly ahead of En Marche. Yellow vest protests have continued to persist despite smaller numbers and gradually improving approval ratings for Macron which have revealed divisions by class and the extent of polarization that exists there. Voters may rebel against his Presidency at the ballot in favor of Le Pen who may tap the visceral emotions of voters more effectively. She has continued to push the narrative that Macron is out of touch with working peoples and fails to understand their plight which has resonated with many disillusioned voters. Despite only a narrow lead for National Rally today, they could outperform polling results similarly to Donald Trump in the US in 2016 as voters may be less likely to vocalize support for National Rally or have a last minute switch in hopes of altering the status quo. That being said, Macron's ""grand debate"" has improved his approval ratings with the French people, albeit gradually, and has shown an ability to change his viewpoints and listen. Also, he has the luxury of being the ""devil they know"" which could provide him with slightly more votes as the pro-European contingency is still robust and voter anxiety about National Rally is still a factor."

The system is a National List for each party (or alliance) and is proportional with a minimum cut off of 5% (so any List that does not get 5% gets no seats). REM does seem to lead in all major polls, which have not seen significant change in response to TV Debates or other recent political event. After the April 26 debate, the range of support for both RN and REM has only moved between very small bands. The graphs show slight declines for both parties and if a trend was plotted one could predict that RN would be ahead of REM by about 15th May. In previous elections the RN seems to hit a ceiling of support of about 22% when there are a full range of parties to choose from. I would not expect RN to be able to get much more support than it has now. REM also does not get much higher support when there are a full range of parties.

In other voting systems e.g. First Past The Post, Single Transferable Vote, D'Hondt) supporters of small parties are likely to vote tactically if their preferred party is unlikely to win any seats. Looking at descriptions of what the parties stand for it appears to me that supports of the very small parties (that have not already made an alliance) are more likely to either vote for the party they prefer in the hope they get over the 5% threshold or switch to another small party. I would not expect many supporters of very small parties to switch to NR or NEM, as a vote to another small party is an effective protest. The polls are very close between RN and REM. I can't see much evidence that the polls changed after the TV debates (maybe Le Pen moved RN up a little after the 24th Apr debate, but the remaining debates have the same people for RN and REM that took part in previous debates that did not move the polls). The range of support for both RN and REM has only moved between very small bands. The graphs show slight declines for both parties and if a trend was plotted one could predict that RN would be ahead of REM by about 15th May (but all trends depend on where you start from). The peak RN figures coincide with the percentages for several parties diverging from their trends significantly (so presumably their were events occurring at these times that affected government popularity). In previous elections the RN seems to hit a ceiling of support of about 22% when there are a full range of parties to choose from. In polls support seems to not go over 26%. So I would not expect RN to be able to get much more support than it has now. REM also does not get much higher support when their are a full range of parties. As these elections are not of critical importance to most French voters (it will not change the French government).

EU elections are an easy way to priest without significantconsewuences, but I think Macron is recovering from his recent slump in popularity, which should improve his party's prospects."

Turnout in elections in France has been on a long term decline, and the 2017 Parliamentary elections were the worst for turnout on record. Presidential elections get the highest turnout, at roughly 70ish%, but I am not expecting these elections to be massively popular in France, so only the most enthusiastic voter will come out. Many of these will have been involved in the yellow vest protests as that is potentially a big signal that they are interested in politics, or it could just be that French people tend to like rioting more than others. The base rate of who usually wins these elections isn't going to be terribly useful given that En March is a new party and NR is still a relatively new force in France, but I'm holding true in that we are in weird times and that EU elections don't get a high turnout in France."

They might not really agree with far-right politics, however the left may not be listening what the people (people of middle class and lower) need to survive, therefore they will go with a right leaning candidate. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-election-france/shunned-by-banks-frances-le-pen-seeks-to-crowdfund-eu-election-campaign-idUSKCN1RE16T;"
