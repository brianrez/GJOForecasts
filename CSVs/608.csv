At least in Europe (but I think FDA is the same) you need to provide better results, either effectiveness or less side effects (or some combination thereof), than the current state of care. This is after you have proven safety (phase I & II trials). The reason why the few new vaccines pass stage three is that showing statistically better results is hard for things where effective vaccines already exist or, if non exists yet, there are very few cases and therefore the statistical significance is not reached in a reasonable amount of time (making it more likely to be a financial loss). For Covid on these two reasons are non-issues. At least for the first couple of vaccines. I'm not sure how this translates to later applications though and I don't think it is a relevant contribution to the resolution of this question. I think here it is a combination of a) does China consider a diplomatic victory more important than immunising their own population? b) does the production capacity suffice to make a) irrelevant b/c they can just supply everyone? c) does China think their data would stand up to EMA/FDA scrutiny?"

On top of that China is not our favorite country of origin and other vaccine candidates will be ahead in the approval line. Not sure what the Europeans will do but their approval process is even administrative than ours. I can't see France approving China's vaccine before they approved the vaccine made by sanofi. And the lack of FDA for EMA approval does not prevent another country from relying on China's approval and utilizing That vaccine for their population. Another observation is the US FDA approves a vaccine if it can provide better results than they already approved vaccines. So Sinova vaccine will most likely be up for approval after Pfizer and moderna have been approved.
