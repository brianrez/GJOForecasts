Therefore a lessor agreement will be made where promises are made but no verification will take place (no need for verification; when two gentlemen such as Trump and Kim give their word only a cynic would doubt it). Both parties will declare ""peace in our time"" (that sounds familiar? Has it been said before?) put in for the Nobel Peace Prize and Russia and China will resume trading with NK. The US might not because some grumpy people in Congress might for political reasons question if a substantive solution to the NK nuclear problem was been reached, but that's fine, NK would be able to trade with Russia and China. The KIC will reopen, but probably not for six months or so. End of story (until next time)"

It is reported that the NK nuclear test site was destroyed by the last nuclear test (and subsequent seismic activity) - this was initially reported some months ago, but there seems to be confirmation. So presumably NK will not be able to conduct nuclear tests for some time, which made it easy for NK to agree to close the test site. That clearly does not mean that NK will agree to give up its nuclear program, but it makes it easier for NK to say it has stopped development. If Trump wants to show he has won a victory over NK, both Trump and NK could claim they had reached a deal where by NK stops nuclear work and the US removes some sanctions, and if Trump says he trusts Kim (which he more or less has already said) it could agreed that NK does not need to agree to very comprehensive nuclear inspections. (A ""don't look to hard"" so we can say ""we see no evidence"", while NK can carry on in secret, kind of deal.)"

The complex was closed down in 2016 after North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test. Since the closure, North Korea has conducted two more nuclear tests. Another factor that would now make it difficult to reopen the complex would be the fact that a U.N. sanctions related review would be needed. When the complex was open South Korea firms would send the wages to a committee running the complex who would then distribute coupons or bills to the workers which was equal to 30-40 percent of the total wages. The sanctions placed on North Korea by the UN has called for closing such committees that were used to distribute the wages. Therefore, in order for the same process to be utilized if the complex were to re-open the UN would have to review their sanctions or eliminate these sanctions. http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2017/05/11/80/0401000000AEN20170511006000315F.html"

Talks between N and S Korea are going to go forward in the next month. I think those talks will focus on the Olympics and not Kaesong but Kaesong could be a rapprochement opportunity. So I see little chance that much will happen with a Kaesong announcement until after the Winter Olympics. However, S. Korea wants to relieve tensions. There is uncertainty in how these talks will play out and what the U.S. will do."

Does this activity account for the totality of what is going on there? Or is it possible that reports of activity there include attempts, successful or not, to restart these industrial facilities? If evidence were to surface that North Korea has figured out how to operate those facilities, then it would only need South Korea assistance in order to evade sanctions against its exports. That would lower probability. If North Korea can't operate these facilities alone, then there remain two hurdles instead of just the sanctions evasion hurdle. I'm not going to 100% not before Aug. 1, 2018 because it is possible that the standoff over nuclear threats might ease by then. In that case, reopening the joint North/South facilities could be a welcome economic boost."

North Korea needs to turn a corner diplomatically; if they do, I believe they'll start to get buy-in from the US and South Korea. but that ""if"" is a wildcard. I've been very bad at predicting what North Korea will do, even though its policy objectives strike me as pretty clear. North Korea's policy objectives seem to be: keep the Kim dynasty in power & get the ability to launch/aim/detonate a nuclear warhead. (I'm not aware of any other high priority North Korean policy goals, and options for having policy goals internationally are largely limited by sanctions that are the price for its taking steps toward nuclear capability.) At this point, it seems to me that any progress toward the nuclear-capability policy goal is inconsistent with this question resolving in the affirmative; I haven't seen signs from North Korea that it will relent on that goal (though China's supposed buy-in on sanctions is often cited as evidence the U.S. is making diplomatic progress on the North Korea issue generally... didn't those ICBM launcher trucks come from China as mining equipment that was later modified?)."

The complex enables NK to earn hard currency and employs NK citizens. It would appear to be specifically banned by the new sanctions. Presumably it could only reopen if NK gave up it its nuclear ambitions. As NK has repeatedly agreed to things and then not done what it had agreed, I would expect that even if NK said it had stopped its nuclear work the US and others would demand evidence that it had done so. Therefore even if NK said it had given in, the sactions would not be lifted for some time, so I think it very unlikely that that the complex would reopen in the next 12 months."

Moon Jae-In has in fact already moved the other way with Thaad deployment. Opposition parties on the right before the election were already unified in their opposition to the reopening while the left had been divided.
