This is some (small) indication that the indicator may not be so responsive to global trends. This (https://www.thenational.ae/business/uae-labour-force-by-sector-graphic-1.53217) is a few years old, but it seems to indicate that only around 15% of the labor force is engaged in extractive industries, hotels and restaurants (presumably the hardest-hit by the crisis). The U.S. economy may hit 20% unemployment--let's say 18%--this year, for a roughly fivefold multiple over 2019. If we see that in the UAE, that would make for 11.5% unemployment. But the lack of responsiveness of the UAE unemployment numbers to the previous global financial crisis suggests that the state takes some measures to ""adjust"" these numbers. Here are three measures for which I've found some evidence. (1) employment of Emirati nationals by the public sector (apparently ~80%). (2) ""flexibility"" in the way labor force data is collected. (3) shipping migrant workers out of the country. I'm going to start off at 20%."

Since many of the non-working in the UAE are not UAE citizens [1] it is not clear to me if they would count in the UAE unemployment numbers, as they have to be tied to an employer, even if they are not being paid. UAE citizens are getting 60% of their paychecks during the lockdown [1]. With that in mind, Emirates has cut 30k jobs [2], and a survey notes that 70% of Dubai's businesses could go bust due to the COVID crisis [3]. All this and low oil prices, make things not look good for getting loans paid back and could cause a general collapse [4]. But, it should be noted that although the UAE was hard hit in 2009 [4], there was barely a blip in their unemployment rate around that time [5]."
