Will farmland values in the Seventh Federal Reserve District be higher in the first quarter of 2017 than they were in first quarter of 2016?,2016-10-28T17:00:43Z,2017-03-31T17:00:00Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']","['Business', 'Economic Indicators']",552,654,246,237,"Read about Superforecasting for the farm at Successful Farming. Falling commodity prices have prompted a decline in the value of agricultural land (Agriculture.com, CropLife). The Seventh Federal Reserve District, which includes all of Iowa and most of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago), saw farmland values decline by 4% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. This question will be resolved by data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago). Changes in land values are reported in the quarterly newsletter and recorded in their historical data as ""Seventh District Land Values."" Question will be suspended on 31 March 2017 and closed when the data for the first quarter of 2017 are released, typically in May.

We see the opposite when inflation is low. Throughout the period of low inflation, the separation between the nominal values and the adjusted values has increased. Just look at that gulf between adjusted values and nominal values. I'm not certain what the inflection point (as seen by intersection, not by change in direction) would look like and if we’d see a similar pattern as the buildup or instead see a crash. It looks like the last intersection in 1981 is the basis for the index. So, which values are appropriate to resolve this question or does it even matter? Nominal or inflation-adjusted? I’m assuming that PCEPI (personal consumption expenditures price index) is a measure of inflation, just as CPI. All of this probably sounds like a lot of babbling."

Gerd Gigerenzer discusses this issue in the Behavioral Economics Guide 2016. In the introductory article titled Taking Heuristics Seriously, he speaks of two sources of error: bias and variance. How do these sources of error impact a prediction? To arrive at that question, Gigerenzer initially brings up the assumption of the accuracy-effort trade-off and how that trade-off might not apply in all cases. In doing this, he compares situations of “risk” versus situations of “uncertainty”. That trade-off does not necessarily apply in situations of “uncertainty” as opposed to situations of “risk”. The bias-variance dilemma is the mathematical principle that assists in helping one understand that playoff. Figure 2 of that article is a good visual depiction of his discussion."

Farmland values for the seventh district have been declining for three years now, and while the rate of decline is slowing (1% in 2016 vs 3% in 2015 and 2014) the fundamental drivers of the decline haven't gone away. Namely, commodity prices are still depressed (although less so), and as the article below points out, farmers are still worrying a lot about cost cutting, not typically a sign that things are improving. Indeed, in his most recent letter (second link) David Oppedahl, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's senior business economist, noted that commodity prices are still below their peak while input prices ""have not fallen as much"".

Whether Clinton gets elected or not, the fact that we are subsidizing these industries and that the trade policies that generally benefit farmers are under attack, any quarrels with China and the world in general will depress the U.S.'s ability to compete in the global market. The damage has probably already been done since Trump's message resonates so well with red farming states. So it's not Trump that is the cause, but a reflection of frustration with farming in these areas. Add to that a little climate volatility, which is beginning to be accepted as a result of climate change, and the result could be difficulties farming due to weather events, and an inability to sell corn and soybean at better prices than last year. Also, the Brazil Real was cheaper last year (which would factor into the opposite conclusion) but lower in general, and China has been importing less."

The last two years of depressed crop prices + recent strong dollar have left American farmers with thin / red margins and limited capital to spend. But if they can afford it farmers are always interested in buying or leasing land that is close to their other farms. The depressed prices will cause many farmers to have to sell land and others to give up leases on farmland. Although this environment will lead to many leases changing hands and many farms being put up for sale, I think the lack of capital on hand and access to credit will cause more of those farms for sale that would normally sell to be leased instead of actually selling this year. Just a single line of thought but that's my initial take. Will have to look more at the numbers and how lease values factor into FMV..."

The other driver of land prices in that region has been urban spreading which may also be slowing down, although not as much. Something funky is going on in the southwestern part of the District--prices went up by 7% there, but not elsewhere in Illinois or across the River in Iowa. Can't find a map that shows the precise correspondence of subdistricts to Illinois counties, but it looks like Adams upriver to Mercer, then east to maybe Bureau, then sort of west-southwest back to Adams but not including Sangamon. Nothing about the farming situation has changed there, but it looks like that area includes Peoria, and also the newer commuting 'burbs of Springfield. Expansion of those places may be bidding up land prices; similarly the creep of Chicago, Evanston, and Milwaukee 'burbs in Wisconsin, where farmland prices are going fairly strong. (Yeah, people really do commute from Wisconsin to Chicago.)"

This year renewed rent agreements have continued to hold and offers to buy farmland are still strong. All of these reasons would support level or higher land prices. The past few years have benefited from near perfect weather leading to large inventory of the most popular crops and the strong dollar has reduced the overseas demand for USA crops. All of those reason would work against higher prices. Considering both sides of the argument and my own contacts in the area I believe the increase will be very modest but not negative with respect to the land prices.
