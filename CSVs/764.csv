I believe that the Chinese influence in Myanmar will push for a result that ensures political stability in the region (from a Chinese point of view). Such a result is a big(ger) majority of the ruling party, perhaps also as a statement to the West. Burmese voters will not care for genocidal accusations. So, perhaps NLD will increase majority, not as a direct reflection of voters’ will, but rather the Chinese desire to cement Burmese political stability. Elections are constitutionally mandated so chances of them not happening are close to 0% (only national emergency reasons can cause them to postpone, and Covid in Myanmar is not a major issue)."

The favorable equation are good, steady economic growth and the overall support for MLD and Kyi. On the other side, NLD may not be able to build tactical alliances with minorities because of the way minorities are treated. Hence, the minority alliance may end supporting their own candidates or from USDP. In such a situation, USDP may increase its tally and occupy more assembly seats than it did in 2015."

They lost against the popularity of Aung Suu Kyi (Nobel prize winner) and her NLD party. She has since suffered international recriminations over the Rohingya crisis and the perception that the NLD has not fulfilled its promises. The USPD has reformed from having military representatives to local civilians as its delegates to align with the voters and the people vote on local issues. The USPD has represented itself as the defender of the Buddhist faith. Myanmar is 88% Buddhist. The first past-the-post electoral system assists the larger parties of which there are two; the NLD and the USPD. There are no polls to indicate the direction of travel. I propose that the USPD will gain seats in the 2020 elections. The election could be affected by Covid-19.
