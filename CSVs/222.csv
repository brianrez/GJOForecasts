Even if Republicans weren't surging almost all across the board due to a tried and true script and a well coordinated push from the GOP super PACs, Democrats in tough districts would be in real trouble from the midterm curse alone. As it stands now, some forecasters see this as toss-up, but no one--not the forecasters or the aggregators--are leaning Democrat in this race at the moment, even if it's a close one. The consensus is approximately 60-40 Nunn, and that feels about right."
