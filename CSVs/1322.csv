How the clean-up is managed, how the derailment is investigated, will be spread across a couple of agencies, but (perhaps as much do to attention / guilt by association, and ignorance by the public about fine grained cause and effect), there will be a loose bleed-over of public outrage, and some will get stuck to EPA. Oddly, EPA may have comparatively less causal responsibility in THIS case, but it will be a kind of poetic justice if the blame game umbrella comes over Pruitt and EPA -- since they *have* gotten away with so much already, that has passed without public notice. (Pruitt's playing fast and loose with principles of environmental custodianship, has left a series of unlit fuses, and this oil car train derailment may convey sudden scrutiny for the past, lousy, unaddressed policy decisions so that they become *lit* fuses.
