This has been happening or the last 3 weeks. 9000 seems to be a base. 10,000 seems to be a ceiling. I don't see any forces to push it down. Breaking through the 10,000 barrier is tough because everyone takes the summer off, depending on which part of the world you live in. Point is, I think there will not be a lot of activity to push it above 10,000 without some other outside event that cannot be seen as of this writing."
