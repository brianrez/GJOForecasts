If there are elections coming up, lets say congress in 14 months time, then this perception will matter. How could Biden show that UK-US relations are stronger than ever?

The Obama administration did not support Brexit because it undermined the liberal democratic international order and was driven by populism, sovereignty and Britain first sentiments. Similarly, the former US administration gained power through populism, America first and MAGA sentiments and was thus not too antagonistic towards Brexit. However, the new administration disapproved of the UK intention of breaching the international rule of law to resolve the Northern Ireland border issue. Add to this back drop the recent timing of US unilateral decision to withdraw from Afghanistan may have exacerbated the situation. I think the etiquette of inviting the UK PM to the White House of a new President will be observed but I am not sure any significance should be attached as to when the invitation is presented, accepted or fulfilled."
