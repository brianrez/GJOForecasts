Will China conduct naval exercises with any ASEAN member before 1 June 2016?,2015-11-24T18:00:22Z,2016-02-21T01:00:32Z,Yes,"['Yes', 'No']","['Foreign Policy', 'Security and Conflict']",819,654,340,237,"Tabletop exercises, war games, and simulations will not suffice to resolve the question. China's defense minister has expressed interest in holding joint naval exercises with members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) amidst heightened tensions in the South China Sea; at least one ASEAN member government has welcomed the proposal (Reuters, CFR, NYTimes). Recommended Questions Will China officially declare an Air-Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) over any part of the South China Sea before 1 October 2016? Will there be a lethal confrontation in the South or East China Sea region involving China's and another country's national military forces or law enforcement personnel before 1 January 2017? Will Russia conduct a naval exercise in the Western Hemisphere with a Central or South American country before 1 July 2016?",https://www.gjopen.com/questions/86-will-china-conduct-naval-exercises-with-any-asean-member-before-1-june-2016

As is evident from the cited article, ""stressing ... cooperation"" and ""deterrence by presence"" were aspects ""complementing the exercise."" As you know, if there was something that we could base an objective determination of ""just what a naval exercise is,"" I'd be the first to argue for that. But, when we do not have such a standard, and the usage employed by the actors does not violate common sense or basic logic, or reveal an intention to deceive, I'm not sure what the reason would be to not just go along with the actors interpretation of events. Here, an independent host country (India) is calling an activity that both China and Malaysia participated in, a [naval] exercise. I see no reason to dispute that claim. The objective of ""cooperation"" seems as good as any other for the purpose of a naval exercise. http://www.indiandefensenews.in/2016/02/message-of-cooperation-in-fleet-review.html"

I think the administrators are asking if any ASEAN nation will take up General Chang on his offer. If that's the case, exercises planned before Chang made his statement in mid-October 2015 will not close the question, since those exercises are not being undertaken in response to his offer. China and many ASEAN countries are already committed to Komodo 2016 and other exercises already, so I think it's unlikely that there will be any exercises in answer to Gen. Chang's statement in the time frame given. I should add that the placement of the air defense missiles in the Paracels also makes this less likely."

I'm not sure why some are seeing confusion in interpreting this question...seems clear to me that any joint naval exercise prior to June 1, 2016 in S China Sea involving China and any ASEAN member will suffice, regardless of other participants. China's attache attended the May 2015 Komodo ""socialization"" meeting among likely participating nations. Janes reported last June that the PLAN would participate and I can't find anything contradicting these claims. Russia just confirmed it will participate in Komodo. I don't see why China would possibly leave itself out at such a critical time for its relations with Indonesia and other ASEAN states. http://thediplomat.com/2016/01/a-first-china-and-pakistan-conclude-naval-exercise-in-east-china-sea/ http://eng.mod.gov.cn/MilitaryExercises/2016-01/02/content_4634962.htm http://www.komodoexercise.org/#!Multilateral-Naval-Exercise-Komodo-2016-Socialization/c1flr/1 http://www.janes.com/article/52390/indonesia-to-host-2016-edition-of-wpns-alongside-multilateral-exercise-fleet-review http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/12/29/russian-destroyer-ship-visit-promotes-friendly-russia-indonesia-military-ties.html"

In my opinion this division comes from the unclarity of the question it self, and a further clarification of the question by the originator would be very helpful. Up to now i have read it that China will be the initiator (host) for specific exercises with any ASEAN country. I denied this up to now because of the sensitivity over the Spratly Islands and the ADIZ, and other politics China vs: US. However if their sole participation is inbuilt in the question, then the Komodo and the Russian initiative (planned for May) with China and possibly other ASEAN countries, will be looked at as a ""yes"". I assume in case no extra exercises are held, China will consider the other two as a full fillement of their will. Therefore for the moment i correct my result slightly upwards as a signal. Dear GJP Admin clarify this point asap. IF you do not clarify I will rather read this as a ""YES"" to include others initiatives such as the Komodo and Russian ones into the question as valid."
