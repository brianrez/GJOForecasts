The lowest point was Nov 6 2020 when it was about 8.5TRY/$. It has strengthened since then, under the guidance of a new finance minister (not the President's son-in-law). Currency usually moves slowly, even the Turkish lira's fall was not monotonic. While it could easily touch 8.5TRY/$ again, it will likely continue to respond to the new finance minister and not leap to 9TRY/$. Due to the short term nature of this question and honeymoon period for the new finance minister I find it doubtful it to drop to 9TRY/$."

The other part of this equation is the US dollar which the general consensus is will continue to remain weak in 2021 led by fiscal stimulus and the fed's aggressive policy to pursue inflation. Possibility of a monetary policy tightening from the fed looks remote at the moment admittedly
