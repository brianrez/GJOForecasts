Egypt is present in the area with its national armed forces. Libya is, in theory, present at this location with armed forces composed of irregular. fighters counting with the support of Turkey. It is more likely for armed scenarios to escalate when irregular armed forces are present. Irregular armies do not subject themselves to rules of engagement and international law principles. Additionally, the magnitude or the potential escalation of the conflict is not part of the considerations taken into account by irregular combatants.

Both countries have the weapons and capabilities to support conflict and engage in small arms fire and artillery, each potentially resulting in mass causalities. Another factor is the support that Egypt has from Turkey, with a threatening posture that could force Libya to respond (Al Jazeera, 2020). VOA suggests that Egypt is increasingly worried about the spread of extremism from Libya and will respond with appropriate force to prevent the spread (VOA, 2020). As tensions increase and the current atmosphere is intensifying, my predictions are as follows: -31% chance https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/8/20/egypt-seeks-support-of-libya-tribes-amid-threat-of-intervention https://www.voanews.com/extremism-watch/fear-instability-behind-egypts-readiness-send-troops-libya-experts-say"
95614,2020-10-11T16:49:12Z,1,[13.0],[13.0],"Between 25 July 2020 and 25 November 2020, will a lethal confrontation in Libya result in five or more fatalities for Egyptian armed forces? Egypt and Libya have been at conflict for numerous years. This conflicted is highly covered as both countries have their own stability on the line but additionally, other nations have been brought into the mix, “the Libyan crisis is a significant challenge to Egypt’s domestic stability and political legitimacy. Since 2013, the conflict has been of strong geopolitical importance for Cairo due to the strategic convergence between UAE and Saudi Arabia and their support for Haftar’s war against the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA)-the latter being backed by Turkey and Qatar” (Atlantic Council, 2020). As discussed from the Atlantic Council, the conflict with Libya not only affects the capital city of Egypt, Cairo, but also the UAE and Saudi Arabia. After months of relative peace, it seems the conflict is beginning to intensify again, “Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said last month that Egypt could send troops into Libya, warning GNA forces not to cross the current frontline between them and LNA. In response, the GNA said it considered el-Sisi’s comments a ‘declaration of war’” (AlJazeera, 2020). It is my opinion that neither country wants to actually go to war or have deadly conflict. It appears that both countries want diplomatic independence while not appearing weak to one another; “President Sisi had drawn a line in the sand – between Sirte on the Mediterranean and the area around the Jufra airbase in central Libya – as Egypt’s ‘red line’ “(BBC, 2020). This notion is further backed up by The International Crisis Group, “for regional actors, Egypt in particular, the stakes transcend Libya and its oil sector. Their main concern is defending their vision of the regional order” (The International Crisis Group, 2020). It is quite clear that Egypt wants to avoid war at all costs, but understands the notion that there may come a time where they have to respond with force. If Egypt is put in a position where they do not respond forcefully, they will not be taken seriously in the Middle East. With all of this considered I put a lethal confrontation of a probability of 13%. Melcangi, A., and Dentice, Giuseppe. (2020, June 18). Libya’s crisis is a tough puzzle to solve for Egypt.

95842,2020-10-11T13:49:15Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],"With the explosion occurring in the Port of Beirut in early August 2020, tensions initially were reduced between Israel and Lebanon. Public support for the government of Lebanon and Hezbollah has fallen due to incompetence observed before and immediately after the explosion as Hezbollah refused to cease control of the Lebanese Finance Ministry in a newly formed government (Deeb, 2020; Times of Israel, 2020). However, the energy behind the initial protests has decreased significantly, with recent protests being significantly smaller in size and comprised of primarily minority populations (Vohra, 2020). Once believed to be on the brink of another civil war where Hezbollah would be focused on internal struggles, the Iranian backed terrorist organization has demonstrated its desire to continue to attack IDF forces, inciting a cross border firefight on 25 August 2020 (Vohra, 2020; Gross, 2020). The IDF returned fire and reportedly utilized military helicopters and aircraft to target Hezbollah positions across the border in Lebanon (Hendrix & Sly, 2020). No casualties were reported by either side after the altercation. The location where Hezbollah engaged IDF troops was between two camps of UN peacekeepers, and was suspected to be an attempt by Hezbollah to have the IDF to accidentally kill the UN forces (Hendrix & Sly, 2020). Engaging in a firefight less than a month after the explosion, as well as the IDF’s willingness to utilize military aircraft to target Hezbollah positions indicates tensions on the border are largely unchanged. Recent fighting against one another within Syria resulted in the death of a Hezbollah fighter, likely contributing to the escalation on the border (The Defense Post, 2020). Clearly evident that despite the explosion and subsequent public uproar, Hezbollah remains steadfast in its fight against Israel. However, both sides are actively avoiding all-out war, likely attempting to avoid inflicting significant casualties (Bassam, 2020). With one month remaining, I propose a 15% probability that a lethal confrontation will occur between Hezbollah and Israel prior to 14 November."

95394,2020-10-08T21:34:28Z,1,[31.0],[31.0],"I assess a 31% chance of the proscribed event occurring. The conflict between these two groups will not escalate to conflict at a high enough level by 25 November 2020 to occasion the loss of five more Egyptian troops. Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi made a dramatic announcement when he stated that Egypt was prepared to move into Libya should national interests be threatened by the current unrest in this region. This proclamation was given with a “red line in the sand”. While not an idle threat, historical trends between these two countries have shown frequent posturing and little action. In February 2015, an Egyptian aircraft conducted several raids on positions belonging to extremist groups inside Libya in response to the slaughter of 21 Egyptian Copts at the hands of ISIS. Cairo is likely to continue this use of force with a limited intervention to securing the border area inside Libya and it could back up such an operation with airstrikes upon pro-Tripoli forces of the Government of National Accord, should they seek to advance. With Sirte located 1,000km from the Egyptian border deploying troops to central Libya would pose significant logistical challenges for the Egyptian army, lengthening supply lines and promising only inconsistent air cover to ground troops. Egypt’s rumored plan to transfer weapons to eastern Libyan tribal groups seems a more likely alternative to direct action. Currently actions by Egypt have shown distrust of this government due to its political Islam and ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, a group which Egypt has historically persecuted. Turkish and Egyptian troops potentially coming into close contact and pro-Russia private military fighters who are also in the fray risks a wider regional confrontation and overt escalation, something not desired by Egypt or its’ allies. An intervention that could expose Egyptian troops to a direct confrontation with the Turkish military and affiliated Syrian fighters in central Libya is still a possibility. Private military contractors of the Russian-owned Wagner company are also consolidating a presence in central Libya, reportedly operating fighter jets in Jufra and bringing in reinforcements to Sirte and the oil terminal areas in a bid to bolster the Haftar forces’ positions there. France, the UAE, and several other neighboring countries, also share the same supposition concerning Libya's threat to regional stability. Outside interference is largely focused around the drilling stations scattered throughout the region. This combined pressure will most likely result in punitive proxy engagement with potential airstrikes in contrast to outright conventional military action against a largely guerrilla force. It should also be noted that sate media and that belonging to nations who have interests in the country have utilized propaganda incessantly in an attempt to legitimize their claims. Three primary channels exist, Libya Al Ahrar, the most balanced but displayed a cautiously anti-Islamist institutionalist agenda, Al Nabaa, which is a staunchly islamic supporter of the revolutionaries, and Libya Awalan, which is conservative anti-Islam. These sources have combined to create a more complicated picture than necessary and overhypes the violence playing out on the ground. Therefore, the engagement will not escalate to the extent of five or more Egyptian casualties within Libya by the date prescribed.

Egypt likely wants to avoid a direct conflict in Libya. However, al-Sisi has drawn a “red-line” along the Sirte-Jufra line. This endangers oil sources. The bigger risk appears to be small groups of Libyan terrorist striking at Egyptian military. Little information is available on Egyptian troops positions and protection. Far less is available on potential border threats from Islamists. The chances of a lethal confrontation between Egyptian forces INSIDE of Libya appears much less likely.

Nevertheless, they need to seem strong. This is why President Sisi stated a last warning to Libya and Turkish fighting forces not to cross their “red line” of Sirte. In saying this, we must ask, how likely is it that Libya fighters will blatantly cross this line? Egypt supports General Haftar, who controls most of the border between Egypt and Libya. An attack on Egypt would have to be more than just a suicide bomber. It would have to be a more organized and effective attack on Egyptian soil to actually push Egypt to put massive amounts of armed forces on Libyan soil. Although there is some Egyptian presence in Libya, whether it be covert or not, it is unlikely that five or more Egyptians will die from conflict on Libyan soil before 25 November.

We determined that the Egyptians probably would not take the risk of conflict personally in this timeframe because it would threaten the supply line between Libya and Egypt. The only uncertain factor is the behavior of Turkey and where they swing their efforts and who they back. So far, there are no deaths in the set up timeline.

In June 2014, smugglers killed six Egyptian border guards. In 2017, a group of Jihadists crossed into Egypt and attacked a security checkpoint, killing 16 Egyptian soldiers. Militants also kidnapped and beheaded 21 Egyptian Christians in 2015. Recently Egypt’s president said last month that he could send troops into Libya, warning GNA forces “not to cross” the current frontline between them and LNA. The GNA responded, considering the Egyptian Presidents comment “a declaration of war”. High tensions remain present both politically, socially, and economically. Most conflict is observed on the “Red Line” between Egypt and Libya, in which several cases Egyptian armed forced have been either injured or killed.

Egyptian forces have not had any battlefield experience since 1973, so they are known to be inexperienced. This means that Egypt is currently adopting a primarily defensive strategy and will not make the first move into Libya. In late August, a ceasefire was announced by Libya’s rival authorities of their ongoing civil war.

Haftar blockaded oil exports in January, decreasing the nation's oil revenues and creating a strategic necessity for Libyan government forces to move further East, towards Egypt. There is a possibility that Egyptian forces will launch incursions into Libya to counter what they see as encroachments on their border. My prediction is not higher due to NATO supporting the Libyan government forces, which would most likely serve as a deterrent against Egypt launching attacks into Libya for fear of a multinational military reaction."
95530,2020-09-27T20:42:17Z,1,[11.0],[11.0],"• Yes I do believe that there is a chance of about 11% that a lethal confrontation in Libya will result in 5 or more fatalities for Egyptian armed forces and here are my reasons why I’m saying that there is only about a 11% chance. • While The Defense Post is saying that, “Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has upped the ante in the chaotic conflict in Libya, warning Cairo could intervene militarily to halt a march eastwards by the Turkey-backed forces of the UN-recognized government.’, they are also saying that, “It is highly unlikely that Egypt will enter a direct war in Libya,” said Hassan Nafaa, political science professor at Cairo University. Sisi’s message was “more a political one than a military one: ‘That Egypt stands by its allies,'” he said.” • According to Samy Magdy of the Washington Post, “Last week, el-Sissi hosted dozens of tribal leaders loyal to Hifter in Cairo, where he repeated that Egypt will “not stand idle in the face of moves that pose a direct threat to security.”But el-Sissi has also pushed hard in recent weeks for a cease-fire and political settlement.” • Also, according to Aljazeera.com, “Libya’s UN-recognised government announced a ceasefire across the country on Friday and called for demilitarising the contested strategic city of Sirte, raising hopes for peace in the more than nine-year-old conflict.” • Based upon the information above, I feel confident in my prediction that there is only about a 11% chance of there being a lethal confrontation in Libya result in five or more fatalities for Egyptian armed forces."
95299,2020-09-27T20:11:17Z,1,[36.0],[36.0],"Currently, Egypt’s President Sisi has drawn a “red line” in Libya. He stated that any attempt by militias loyal to Tripoli to cross this line will be considered a direct threat to Egypt’s national security. This “red line” was drawn back in August. Since the peak of this confrontation during this past August, there have been many engagements that have resulted in casualties, but none of which pertain to the Egyptain military. Along with this, President Sisi stated that they are currently looking for a peaceful diplomatic solution and are avoiding the usage of forceful military assets. Using inductive reasoning, with only about two months left, no recent fatalities amongst Egyptian forces, the pursuit for a diplomatic solution and still high tensions; it is safe to predict that there is a slight chance that there will be no lethal confrontation that will result in five or more fatalities for the Egyptian armed forces."
95557,2020-09-27T19:57:02Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],There is a 5% chance that there will be more than 5 fatalities to the Egyptian armed forces. Egypt is not in a good place at the moment to be fighting a war. Egypt cannot afford the war and their allies are unreliable. If Egypt was to have lethal fatalities in Libya that would further escalate their situation and Egypt would have little chance of succeeding in.
95513,2020-09-27T18:11:22Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],"No. Egypt is pretty much trying to do what we are doing in the middle east. Libya has no form of state institutions or police or anything, so they are trying to do all they can to keep it from becoming a safe-haven for terrorists. The last time an Egyptian was killed in Libya was in 2017, so i do not see it to be likely. The situation there is very unstable, but I do not think either country wants to go to war."
95527,2020-09-27T17:45:22Z,1,[40.0],[40.0],I believe there is potential because of the heat of the area and the two forces wanting control over the same thing. But not many countries want war and that i exactly what would happen if this scenario was to play out.

As of today, Libya is an unstable country with warlords as government leaders. Before Libya let Egyptians enter thier states, Egypt was already had the idea of invading Libya without thier permission. Tensions are very high between these two countries, but its interesting to see that Libya’s government let the Egyptians intervene in thier state. Thier is a 40 percent chance that this will lead to an all out war and fatalities. There will be a 60 percent chance that nothing will happen."

With the United Nations, Russia and the UAE also involved they will have a shared interest in ensuring that the situation does not reach a global level. I give a 35 percent chance of lethal confrontation due to the unpredictability of a terrorist organization. In 2017, 16 Egyptian soldiers were killed in a border attack by the jihadists. The Egyptian military has not seen action since 1973 and is prone to mistakes backing General Khalifa Haftar."

I say this because if Egypt does get into a conflict with Libya, Turkey will get involved due to their partnership with Libya which then leads Egypt to fighting a foe that is their neighbor which they do not want to have happen. Instead of a conflict of force I believe with is will be a conflict of politics rather than actual confrontation. Egypt isn't looking for a confrontation with Libya because thy know they won't get much support especially from their Arab neighboring countries. While Egypt has approved sending troops into Libya I predict this is only a show of might to the Libyans to say they are not afraid to put people in the country but it will be the last resort."

Increasing foreign involvement from the UN and Russia will ensure that Turkey and Egypt face economic and judicial pressure if they continue to escalate in Libya. In addition to this, a cease fire called in August both opened the doors for negotiations and proved that Turkey has lost some of its advantage in Libya since its military intervention."

This https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/08/egypt-seeks-support-libya-tribes-threat-intervention-200820091114854.html seems to suggest that movement towards Sirte by the parliamentary/islamist forces would be a “red line”.

94632,2020-08-18T20:13:43Z,3,[26.0],[15.0],"In order for these requirements to be met you must have (a) Egyptian troops in Libya and (b) some conflict that results in 5 or more deaths. At the moment, Egypt is primarily posturing, and has not allowed requirement (a) to be realized. However, they have drawn a line in the sand and stated in no uncertain terms that any Libyan militants loyal to the opposition crossing that line would be classified as a national security threat and lead to an invasion. A full-fledged invasion would likely spur on both (a) and (b), but how likely is this. Well, baseline, since Egypt overthrew Morsi in 2013, there have only been three occassions where more than 5 Egyptians have been killed in a single conflict with Libyan militia. Of these three incidents, only two killed more than 5 armed Egyptian forces and the other one was the only that occurred on Libyan soil, meaning none of these events meet this criteria. However, if we take the total number of conflicts resulting in 5 or more Egyptian deaths, that gives us 3 in 7 years, or a roughly 43% chance each year. With less than four months left, this goes down to around 14%. However, the line in the sand is not the Egyptian border, it is drawn across Libya, making the odds of they are crossed much higher, say 28%. Moreover, Turkey is now vocally supporting Libyan rebels campaign against Egypt, which is likely to embolden them towards more aggressive actions. So raise it to 42%. The line being crossed, however, does not necessarily mean Egypt will invade since their only motivation will be to save face since the line itself is not all that close to the Egyptian border. I'd say there is around a 70% chance they would commit troops if this did occur, leaving us with 29%. If troops are committed, I'd give it a 90% chance that more than 5 are killed (assuming it is a fair amount of troops), though whether this is before November 25th depends entirely on when they are deployed. Regardless, that comes out to about a 26% chance more than 5 Egyptian troops are killed in a single conflict inside Libyan borders."

With the US, Russia, and the UN now taking key positions and (at least outwardly) supporting peace talks and discussions, as well as a ceasefire, it would make even less sense for either country to ramp up tensions further. If a full-fledge war breaks out, Egypt will lose control of the region completely and will likely get none of the benefits of Libyan gas deposits while Turkey would likely be forced to watch even more areas of Libya cut out and controlled by various organizations (foreign and domestic) and the whole country descend further into chaos."

Egypt may or may not be bluffing, but I think they would really like Russia to do the dirty work for them. Especially because tourism will probably come back at some point and they don't want the news feed filled with war stories. They also have to deal with the Ethiopian conflict. Putin on the other hand could use a military victory."

So, a conflict that produces casualties for Egypt is limited to either a confrontation of ground troops, or a loss of an Egyptian fighter jet. I assign: 80% that Egypt does send troops in to Libya, either by air or land. 40% that Egyptian troops actually reach hot zones, such as Sirte, by land. If they do, I assign an 80% chance for 5 Egyptian casualties or more. This adds up to 26%. I would like to add, to the above, the probability of an Egyptian air strike to Sirte going wrong, such as 2-3 Egyptian MiGs being shot down by GNA or Turkish forces, to which I would assign a 20% probability. Adding up the probabilities for ground and air fatalities I will assign 46% to 5 or more Egyptian casualties."

Assuming any ceasefires fail and there is confrontation, the risk of Egyptian troops (5 or more) being killed are high, otherwise 0%"
