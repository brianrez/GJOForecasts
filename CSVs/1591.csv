A substantial proportion of the population in the northeast continues to face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4) acute food insecurity, with an increased risk of high levels of acute malnutrition and excess mortality. Less accessible areas remain at risk of Famine (IPC Phase 5). As of September 27th, 4,114 cases of cholera have been reported in Borno State, with 56 deaths and a Case Fatality Rate of 1.4 percent. High concentrations of the outbreak have been reported in the Muna corridor of Jere LGA (1,991 cases), Dikwa LGA (687 cases), and Monguno LGA (1,396 cases), while cases in Maiduguri metropolitan area and Mafa stand at 34 and 6, respectively. Suspected cases have been identified as being at ‘high risk’ in Bama, Biu, Kala Balge, Kukawa, Mobbar, Ngala, Hawul, Damboa, and Gwoza local government areas. Households outside of the northeast of Nigeria are engaged in early harvests of millet, maize, cowpea, groundnut, and cassava, and are consuming own-produced foods. Similarly, the favorable main season harvest which is underway in localized areas has led to increased availability and a decline in staple food prices, improving food access for poor households. Most poor households in these areas are engaged in normal income earning opportunities and are facing Minimal (IPC Phase 1) acute food insecurity. Heavy rainfall events and above-average cumulative precipitation in much of Nigeria and the neighboring countries of Niger and Cameroon led to flooding in at least 22 states in Nigeria, including significant impacts in Benue, Kogi, Niger, Ebonyi, and Delta States. In Benue and Kogi States, flooding led to the displacement of over 250,000 people who are currently living in camps. Similarly, some houses have been destroyed and cropped fields damaged. The government and humanitarian partners are currently providing food and non-food support, including access to water for the displaced persons. The preliminary results of a joint WFP/FEWS NET market survey showed that market functioning in conflict-affected areas of Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa States are gradually improving. However, staple food prices remain higher relative to the same time last year and well-above average price levels. Household demand remains elevated by 70, 63 and 64 percent, across Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States, respectively, relative to the same period of last year."
