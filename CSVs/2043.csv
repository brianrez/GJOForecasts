How many countries will Russia remove from its food embargo list before 6 August 2016?,2015-10-05T20:00:55Z,2016-08-05T17:00:37Z,0,"['0', 'Between 1 and 5, inclusive', 'More than five, but less than all', 'All']","['Economic Policy', 'Foreign Policy']",1691,654,421,237,"This question has been closed under answer option ""a)0"" with an end date of 5 August 2016. Russia extended its food embargo through the end of 2017 (RT, Sputnik International). While there have been modifications to the embargo, notably to allow the importation of certain products for use in baby food (Russia Beyond the Headlines, Tass), all of the embargoed countries remain on the list. Russia imposed an embargo on food imports from the US, EU member states, Canada, Australia, and Norway in August 2014 as retaliation for western sanctions, later adding Iceland, Albania, Montenegro, and Liechtenstein to the list (Yahoo News). On 16 September 2015, Russia lifted the embargo on specialized products for sports nutrition (LatestNewsResource), but most of the embargo remains in place for all affected countries. If new countries are added to the list before the question expires, their subsequent removal will count. This question will be scored using the ordered categorial scoring rule.

Will any NATO member invoke Article 4 in response to actions taken by Russia before 1 January 2017?

EU farmers care more about their farms and family's well being than anything in Ukraine, hence the current protests in France. Russian people are paying almost twice as much for some food products compared to before sanctions. With upcoming elections United Russia and Putin have a lot of incentive to lift food embargoes as a first step in relief to Russian's daily lives. Eastern European farmers at some point will begin to wonder about their allegiance to an EU whose policies force them to accept unwanted refugees and not to sell their products to their traditional key market, Russia. Farmers' lives and incomes are measured in crop years, not calendar years. If the sanctions are not lifted before summer planting or at least before fall harvest, then they have already lost another year. If sanctions are lifted this year, it should happen before August to satisfy that need. http://www.france24.com/en/20160215-france-angry-farmers-blockade-vannes-protest-falling-prices"

He actually predicted the ruling party would lose elections late next year due to public dissatisfaction with economy. I know Putin's support is fairly staunch but regardless of any election, it does seem likely that in the event of any significant loss in public support for ""braving"" the sanctions, the removal of some or all food embargoes would be Putin's best option for compromise to alleviate public sentiment.

However, even if new contries are added, this question asks if any contries will be removed. August 2016 is still a long time ahead and time could provide at least some kind of agreement in Syria and/or put the russian government under pressure internally. While I don't believe all issues will be resolved, at least some (or: one) of the embargos (maybe one of the yet to come embargos) could be removed due to economic reasons. Taking into account that in the current situation it would be hard to argue, why only one embargo should be lifted, I am going with a moderate 60/40 on one vs. none and will update this especially if new embargos should be added, If I regard them as temporary. As I take it: The more countries will be on the list, the higher the chance that at least one embargo gets lifted."

In addition, the attacks last week cutting the power lines from Ukraine to the Crimea are likely to inflame the war in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian separatist and Russian forces may try to push south through Mariupol along the western edge of the Black Sea to establish a land link between Russia and the Crimea, which is now dependent on Ukraine for power, water and gas. That would ease the difficulties and risks of Russia's logistical support of the Crimea somewhat, but would also likely harden EU positions."

(http://www.bbc.com/news/world-33905340 ) It will try to increase imports from countries that it finds less objectionable. Meanwhile, the disgruntlement of Russian consumers will be held in check by the traditional remedy for economic bans: smuggling. Belarus is now shipping genuine Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, made only in a few regions in Italy, into Russia with ""Made in Belarus"" labels slapped over the top of the original Italian labels, for instance. Smuggling will continue apace, because it is lucrative for the smugglers, desirable for the consumers, and a nice income source for suborned customs officials. Russia cannot stop it all; look at cigarettes that come across the US border from Canada for a prime example of the failure of that economic remedy."

(Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Ukrainian_crisis). this same piece cites the Bow Group's report calling for the removal of sanctions on ground that they are both ineffective and damaging to the economies of the countries that impose them. The G7 must renew their collective sanctions agreement at the end of 2015. though there is potential for a dramatically early Russian presidential election in spring 2016, a change of leadership that potentially inspires a reversal of Russia's food embargo policy is unlikely given Putin's popularity in the opinion polls remains over 80%. The food embargo policy, though criticised within Russia, is not sufficiently impactful to induce a politically-motivated reversal. Russia has suffered economically as a result of the sanctions imposed on it however Putin will not lift sanctions unilaterally, in an effort to trigger a lifting of sanctions imposed upon it, as it would demonstrate political weakness. I see a stalemate remaining unless France can indeed mobilse sufficient support internationally to begin the process of lifting the sanctions on Russia. The US, in it's role as world's policeman, will lobby/reward small/medium sized nations who stick with their sanctions program. That said, I believe Russia will strive to reach a mutual agreement with at least 1 country in the given timeframe in order to undermine the pact waged against it."

Personal, biased view to this is that it won't happen with current administration.

Simplest scenario is change of views in some of listed countries, like for example change of government in Montenegro with ""no"" to NATO, followed by friendly actions from Moscow. We can also imagine some EU countries removed from the list, just to create confusion. Total for this option 40%. 15% for friendly gesture, 25% for political games.

I think this is by far the most likely option. 1-5: Russia lifts the embargo on one (or maybe a few) peripheral countries (perhaps Greece?).

If the EU maintains sanctions, it is extremely unlikely that 6+ nations would drop off. If the EU drops sanctions, they are more than 5 by themselves. If the EU splits on sanctions, it is unlikely that fewer than 5 nations would abandon sanctions. So, the probabilities are almost totally dependent on what the EU does.
