The Democrats most recent field with over 10 candidates was '88, with Biden and Schroeder dropping out before the primaries, and after Iowa, there were still 11 candidates in the race. Due to the proportional delegate allocation system in the Democratic Party, there is little incentive to drop-out, as opposed to within the Republican Party, where the winner-takes-all system penalizes losers. Forecasting around even tighter windows than between now and Iowa is extremely sensitive to individual campaign situations. One would assume Wayne Messam would have dropped out a long time ago -he is the most likely candidate to drop-out-, but he hasn't. You can split the field into tier 1 candidates, who have over 3% of support in polls -Biden, Buttigieg, Harris, Sanders & Warren-, and tier 2 candidates, who are the rest of the candidates who qualified for the debates, but have less than 3% traction, and assume that none of them will drop-out, including Sanders, whatever his health situation. Tier 3 candidates are the 0-1%ers. Paradoxically, I think, apart from Messam, they have little reason to drop-out, even if they are forced to scale back their activities, because their continued candidacy keeps their brand growing, cf. Williamson, and because they can appeal directly to voters and build support outside traditional structures, cf WIlliamson & Yang. Bullock can use this cycle as a training exercise for the future. Ryan can run two races at once but that may force his hand at some point. Delaney and Ryan may rethink their candidacy but again, they have nothing to lose from staying in the race. Apart from Messam who generates bad or no press, there is no obvious candidate, and Messam's campaign may simply be too inept to formally withdraw."
