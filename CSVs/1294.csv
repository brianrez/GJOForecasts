This means it would have to have a much higher per screen average than at least 4 other movies that will be on 2500+ screens the same weekend. It is rather unlikely given the good but not great reception in the friendly Toronto crowd during TIFF. There is just not enough buzz to warrant a high per screen average. It will also compete for progressive viewers with White boy rick and Assassination Nation while there are 3 movies that grossed over 20mln USD the previous week + 1 movie being released this week forecasted to open in that range. The holdovers will drop to min 10mln usd + while all tracking suggests Fahrenheit will open arund 4mln.
