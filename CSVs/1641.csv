"Before 31 December 2017, will President Trump sign legislation removing the ACA's individual mandate to purchase health insurance?",2017-07-14T17:00:09Z,2017-12-22T18:00:52Z,Yes,"['Yes', 'No']","['Health', 'US Policy']",1138,654,407,237,"The individual mandate is a part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA, or Obamacare) that requires most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty. In May 2017, the House passed a bill to “repeal and replace” the ACA with a provision that would end the individual mandate. The issue has moved to the Senate (Fox News, Vox). The passage of legislation which limits enforcement (e.g by removing the penalty or prohibiting the use of federal funds to enforce the provisions of the individual mandate) would resolve the question as ""yes"" (Cornell Law).

However, the Senate may (or may not) strip this measure from their version - it requires 60 votes. Some Republicans, like Rand Paul, are not in favor either. One difficulty of stripping the waiver is that the House would have to vote again on the amended bill - which would be difficult as they are reportedly leaving town now - so the Dems in the Senate may decide to acquiesce to the House version, not to be blamed for a government shutdown.

This law would create across-the-board spending cuts that the GOP would most likely not want to take responsibility for. In order to pay the tax bill without the spending cuts, Congress must pass a waiver that is not filibuster-proof. If President Trump waits until 2018 to pass the tax bill, Congress will have a full year to pass the waiver. At the moment, this seems like a much more likely possibility than trying to rush the passing the waiver before the end of the year."

My feeling -- that's all, just a feeling -- is that the reconciliation process will either include the mandate repeal, or else the tax bill will fail to pass this year, if ever. Republicans are terrified of angry giant donors who have been withholding donations, demanding giant tax breaks or else. Democrats are terrified of their donors, for example the real estate industry, health care, state and local governments, etc. who will be hammered by this bill, whatever it is. This bill features approximately 500 pages with cross outs and extensive revisions hand written on the margins mean that nobody right now knows what they really voted for or against. No hearing ever were held of this last minute version of the bill. This is unprecedented in modern history, perhaps forever in the U.S."

With this in mind, the failure margin in the Senate is small - the skinny repeal failed 51-49, so only one senator needs to flip to bring in Mike Pence for a tie-breaker - I suspect McCain is the most likely candidate to flip. Nevertheless, McConnell has announced his intention to move past healthcare for this session of Congress. Although President Trump continues to push and tweet about proceeding on healthcare, his administration recently experienced a divergence from the Republican establishment (resignation of Reince Priebus); this shift eliminates a key avenue for his pressure to actually bear fruit. As a result, Republican legislators face the same usual pressure they have since the 2010 midterms, namely their base wants to see something happen; they also face pressure from the optics of being totally in control of the government and yet failing to make a successful run at their signature issue of the last 7 years; and, as noted, they face pressure from the de facto leader of their party (POTUS).

The announcement follows Sen. John McCain's surgery that will keep him away from Washington next week. The bill has two GOP senators in opposition already and likely would have failed to advance with McCain's absence."

Political scientists call that “protecting one’s backside. Indeed, in a Senate with only 52 Republican members, 60 votes may be easier to achieve than 51.”"
