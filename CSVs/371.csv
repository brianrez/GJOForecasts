The dam is located within Etiopia and it is fully within Ethiopia's rights to build and reap the benefits of a dam on its territory. It is in the best interest of the three countries to come to an agreement to ensure their water needs are met and to provide a venue for disagreements for they are sure to come up. In addition, the dam can help reduce the damaging effects of seasonal floods and introduce a third farming season into all three countries."

102652,2021-10-11T13:28:03Z,1,[55.0],[55.0],"My starting point looking at historical data shows that 4 out 5 instances (or 80% of the time) in the last 50 years, nations that share transboundary water resources have come to an agreement (37 violent clashes/disputes out of 187 similar situations as noted by the UN at https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/transboundary_waters.shtml). However, I am less optimistic in this situation given that the three nations involved have had since 2011 when construction began on the GERD to come to an agreement. As well, Ethiopia has now completed two rainy seasons where the reservoir was filled and 2022 will bring the final rainy season required to complete the filling process. Officials at Sudan’s Al-Rusaires Dam, only 100km from the GERD, reported that they have not observed reductions in the flow of the Nile River even while the second reservoir filling was underway (https://www.newsday.co.zw/2021/07/sudan-says-nile-water-level-stable-despite-ethiopias-2nd-filling-of-nile-dam/#:~:text=The%20Al-Rusaires%20Dam%20on%20the%20Blue%20Nile%2C%20which,to%20the%20filling%20and%20operation%20of%20the%20GERD.) To me this fact reduces the pressure on even coming to an agreement at all between the three nations, especially by the 1 Sep 2022 timeframe as the question is written. However, one thing that still keeps my forecast on the plus side of 50% is that the closer the deadline looms for the final filling of the reservoir, more pressure will be felt and exerted for the three nations to come to an agreement. Then again, a serious complication to the negotiations is the inclusion of overall Nile Water Quotas in the discussions about the GERD which have been in place since 1959. That may mean that a final agreement will simply take longer to reach than in the next year."

Sudan has reported no decrease in flow during the second filling. The UN security council is not getting actively involved. All of these point to no agreement. The wild card is what happens if flow is impacted and how serious is Egypt's threat of military action?

Egypt and the Sudan who rely on the Nile waters for their needs are relying on traditional water rites. The Egyptian President, Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi, made a strategic mistake by signing a Declaration of Principles that gave Ethiopia carte blanche to control the Nile waters and believes that another agreement is not necessary. Unfortunately, the Declaration did not allow for any mechanism to resolve any future disputes. Negotiations have stalled, due in the opinion of Egyptian and Sudanese officials, the lack of Ethiopian seriousness in concluding talks in a bid to buy time to complete the filling of the dam. There is little leverage that can be applied to persuade Ethiopia to comply with the wishes of Egypt and the Sudan. Ethiopia’s major trading partners are the U.S., Saudi Arabia, U.A.E. and Israel, none of which are affected by the dam and its economics. The U.N Security council issued a Presidential statement calling for resumption of talks led by the African Union (AU), although India later stated that ‘as a general rule, transboundary water issues do not belong to the domain of the UN Security Council’. The Egyptian Ambassador to the U.N. did not object to Ethiopia’s right, but considering the existential threats to his country, the Egyptians should defend their right to life. This potential threat may have perhaps been for his domestic consumption but would indicate a possible escalation of hostile intentions. Sudan’s Irrigation Minister Yasser Abbas described negotiations in the current are a ‘waste of time’ and wants to involve the AU, UN, EU and the US. (This has been refused by Ethiopia, not to mention the distance effected by all the other parties)."

Ethiopia has the upper hand because they're upstream, but Egypt and Sudan can cause problems for Ethiopia. I can picture the situation festering for years without any formal agreement and potentially coming to a head during the next substantial drought, during which time Ethiopia could potentially exact concessions in return for the release of some water. No, Ethiopia isn't going to come to the table to talk because this reservoir is a source of power for them, literally and figuratively, in addition to being central to their water security. They haven't come to an agreement about GERD in a decade. What's going to change now? I also appreciate and agree with the analysis by @AimadEO."
