The popularity of the color white (one of the discontinued colors) on cars makes low demand unlikely. Now black is the only no-additional-cost color you can order from Tesla which will result in overall higher prices for a Tesla. At any rate, whatever the reason(s) this is more likely to hurt sales rather than help them. Additionally, Tesla has just dropped the entry-level model X as an option for purchase. Once again, why? Production problems or lack of demand? Either way, fewer colors and fewer cars to choose from = fewer sales overall. My forecast is therefore revised down to 10% from 11%."

Then GS forecasted TSLA to 250. The stock rallied after that. Now third Q reports puts TSLA on the verge of beating their original forecast for 2016. And GS downgraded TSLA stock to 170 area. If TSLA beats their own downgraded forecasts with numbers from the start of the year after a GS downgrade the stock is going to explode upwards just in the nick of time to raise some cash for the next project in 2017. This would look very scandalous. Perhaps even FINRA worthy. I'm not sure how to forecast this question. I'd like to opt out.

I read the book on Elon Musk, and he seems like the kind of person that would not take kindly to missed dates. Also with down-payments on the more recent forthcoming model behind us, he now has an excellent idea on what he needs to scale up. I suspect that means some pretty big orders recently went into purchasing new/better manufacturing equipment. I don't know how long it takes to ramp up EV manufacturing, but my experience with Window manufacturing suggests 3 months would be super fast. So maybe that won't help.

The target was also announced amongst results that generally disappointed consensus expectations in the market so it was an easy option to set a high production target for 2016 to help offset disappointment elsewhere. His management style also involves setting ambitious targets and goals to motivate and challenge himself and his staff. There is also always a risk of a problem developing in the manufacturing process which could slow production or if there is a mass recall which always must be a risk with such new and innovative technology. On the other side both the model S & X are fully established this year and they will not start producing the model 3 until next year so that wont slow down production of the other two models. Also given past annual increases in production a 60% increase does sound plausible although it remains to be seen whether it is easy to just extrapolate past increases in what is still a very young company operating in a highly technical field.
