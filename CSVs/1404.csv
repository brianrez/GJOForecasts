Thus, I altered these odds x 10, as I expect there to be a pro-feminist bent to this decision-making process. Still, it's not likely she'll come away with the award, because the film she worked on is not likely to be a high achiever elsewhere.

""Dunkirk"" also stuns in its sense of bigness. Nolan was perfect for this and it easily topples the newest, perhaps harder to tackle, Blade Runner film. While her film was beautifully shot I have only the rated the odds this high because it's rare to see a woman nominated much less twice in a row."

Her film is beautifully shot, but there is some really tough competition and while I think Deakins had the more technically difficult film to pull off? ""Shape of Water"" is just too strong in its vision. I only put the odds this high because it's rare to see a woman, and twice in a row too, nominated."
