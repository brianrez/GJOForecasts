Gardaworld is suggesting security forces may become embroiled in demonstrations and clashes between rival groups. Supporters of both camps have been organising rival rallies with the inauguration scheduled for July 28. While there is contention and a slim chance, it is presumed neither party will concede to allow a peaceable transition and not helped by rumours of a military coup if the left-wing Castillo is successful over the right-wing Fujimori.

Only one of these protests has resulted in a fatality. Any would-be political protests occurring before 18 July are likely to be smaller in scale, given the most likely trigger is Peru's narrowly contested recent presidential election. Then we can estimate an ""adjusted"" number of protests as ~20, and so the base rate of protest fatalities would be 1/20. In terms of non-political protests in Peru, since 2009 there have been 5 notable events, with 4 resulting in fatalities. We estimate the probability of one of these events occurring prior to 18 July as (11 days)/((12 years)(365 days/year)) * 5 = 1.26%. Then apply a 4/5 = 80% fatality probability, with almost certain probability of less than 20 fatalities."

Observers form the Inter-American Union of Electoral Organizations, (UNIORE) commended the National Election Board (JNE) for a ‘correctly organized and successful’ election, according to the JNE president. The election on June 6 gave Pedro Castillo 50.125 % with Keiko Fujimori on 49.875% of the vote, giving a difference of 44.058 votes from 18.8 million cast. Fujimori has challenged the result with charges of electoral fraud and there can be no transition of power until these have been resolved. Demonstrations and counter demonstrations have been held peaceably so far. The divisions are between the urban coastal areas and the rural highlands that include wealth and ethnic divides. Michelle Bachelet the United Nations high commissioner for human rights has issued a statement condemning hate speech and discrimination and urging an acceptance of the result. Given the official recognition of the electoral process and result and the level of peaceful protests so far, extreme violence resulting in fatalities would only become a reality if the result was overturned by a coup (as suggested by a group of ex-army officers)."
