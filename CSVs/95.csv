With a month to go that would add up to another 1.3 million cases were things to be linear, which they never are. So I think bin 4 and above are out unless there is some very new set of circumstances. Bin 1 also seems to be optimistic as even an average of 600 cases would get them over that line but it's still a remote possibility. On the other hand, bin 3 doesn't take into account the rapid fall in cases."
