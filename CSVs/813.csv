I take that as a sign that this particular reform is unlikely to be among reforms proposed by Republicans. Finally, Trump himself has both spoken and acted on the ""pro-police"" side of the issue, meaning he may oppose any legislation that could be characterized as ""anti-police"" that Congress supports, including this one.

Of the 54 cosponsors of the bill in the house only one is republican.[2] I believe Trump and other high profile republicans are avoiding the issue at the moment because of the protests, but when the protests die down, which I believe they will do in late summer early autumn at the latest, they will push back hard.
