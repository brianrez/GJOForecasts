The book has raised my interest in the long history of US misunderstandings about Chinese political dynamics and intentions. Time and again US players have seen what they want to see in China, and missed the reality. With the distracting blizzard of Trump tweet commentary, perhaps today's big mistake is to see the North Korea problem as a North Korea problem, when it appears to be a China problem. China's expansionist strategy has many elements, including claims to the South China Sea, naval base construction in the Indian Ocean, recent border clashes with India and relentless pressure on US affiliates including the Philippines, South Korea and Japan. If China's strategic goal is to break apart the structure that has controlled the Western Pacific region since the end of WW II, North Korea is simply China's useful dog in this campaign. China's ideal preferred end game would include: (1) tractable vassal states in Japan, Philippines, Vietnam that have no alliance with the United States. (2) restoration of Taiwan and various perimeter island chains as China possessions, (3) reunification of the Korean peninsula under a socialist or communist political regime that China would dominate, and (4) Chinese control of the Eastern hemisphere to a degree that would be similar to what the Monroe Doctrine once was in the Western Hemisphere. If this is the great game being played, six party talks would be a farce, and no progress will come from getting in a room one-on-one with Kim."

After many hours with the North Korean delegation at these ‘1.5 track’ talks, we left more pessimistic than when we arrived. North Korean officials made unambiguously clear that Pyongyang will not be deterred from augmenting its nuclear arsenal or test-launching an intercontinental ballistic missile that could eventually threaten the U.S. homeland. There were no signals of flexibility or willingness to negotiate on these programs. Throughout, the North Korean message was that denuclearization is off the table.” http://wapo.st/2tVpt13"

I would imagine that the last thing SK and Japan would want is the US and NK have two party talks (who knows what Trump might offer NK to give up its nuclear weapons - SK?). For different reason China and Russia would probably not be happy with US and NK having two party talks. Trump has said he does not like multi-national deals so I am assuming he would block 6 Party talks (and without the US they are not 6 Party). On the other hand is Trump consistent?
