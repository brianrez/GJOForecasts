This can be taken as a baserate. (https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx250jmk4e7t/pound-sterling-gbp). The House of Commons rejected Theresa May's withdrawal agreement three times, yet this did not affect the rate. Neither did the ecision to extend the deadline for the Uk leaving the EU for that matter. The prime minister's embattled position and the rumours about a revolt in her cabinet failed to have any noticeable effect on the rate as well. Given the political magnitude and far reaching ramifications of these events the chances for the Pound to fall below the 1.10 line in the few remaining hours until April 1 can be considered close to non-existent.

For the rest of 2016 it remains between 1.1 and 1.2. In 2017 the exchange rate has reached a minimum level of 1.075 and a maximum of 1,1955€. In 2018 there wasn’t a huge difference: the average of the exchange rate has been 1£ = 1.1303€, with a maximum of 1.1578 and a minimum of 1.1004 (but always >1.1€). Since the beginning of the 2019 the value of 1 £ has changed between 1,1€ and 1,18€, without ever reaching 1,2€. So, from the statistics, we should exclude the possibility of an exchange rate under 1€, focusing on the other possibilities. The last three months have been a critical period for Great Britain, with the Parliament rejecting twice the agreement reached between the premier May and the EU about a soft Brexit, plus the pressures of the ultimate date to take a decision (29 of March) and the internal fights in the party at the government. All these factors have an impact on the markets, but in the last years they have never had an effect that brought to have an exchange rate higher than 1.2 (excluded). Also, one week ago the British Parliament has approved the delay of the Brexit until the 30th of June, which could make the market stable until that day, because there won’t be yet an official Brexit. Still, I’m sure the pound will remain weak but sticking between 1.10 and 1.20€. However, because the markets are unpredictable, we cannot exclude completely the possibility of a higher loss for the GBP. Also, the EU has still to accept or not the extension of the art.50 (hard Brexit is still theoretically possible). These reasons make me set some possibilities for the first and the second options."

For example, the aforementioned high was reached on March 14, 2019 — the day in which the Commons voted to allow May to request permission to extend — in response to increased knowledge of the state of the market in the near future (one where the UK is unlikely to leave the EU on March 29).

This is likely to stabilise the market — no matter the outcome, since the market prefers to operate in the known. It is unforeseeable that the GBP will reach a value outside the 1.1-1.2 parameter, as it has not done in the last year and the greater certainty surrounding Brexit on April should reduce major anomalies. Thus this is forecasted at 80%. An equal chance of 10% is given to either side of this parameter accounting for the chance a boom resulting from a stabilisation, or a serious fall resulting from an unexpected hard Brexit."

Since November 2015, the pound fell sharply from 1.43 for 1 euro on November 27, 2015, to 1.17 on November 25, 2016, after the vote. Since 2016, the pound has stagnated around 1.15 on average until now. It is therefore in a low position, and the great uncertainty that the Brexit will bring by April 1, 2019 will not tend to increase certainly. It must therefore be known that the British political evolution will be inseparably linked to the evolution of the pound, and that Brexit will therefore be the catalyst of the value of the pound. According to the different scenarios of Brexit, we can try to understand the possible value of pound against the euro : - In the case of the extension of the Brexit deadline, the value of the pound will not have to change so much and therefore be between 1.10 and 1.20. Or even in the case of a finely played Brexit soft, go up a little more than the average of the last two years. Moreover, this Brexit scenario seems the most likely (in a forecast I place it at 65%). - In the case of Parliament's adoption of the Brexit agreement, the pound is expected to fall but still stabilize thanks to agreements with the European Union. The likelihood of this scenario is 20% in my opinion. The fall will not be too brutal. In case of No-Deal, depreciation of the currency will be extremely strong. Indeed, imports will be much cheaper against UK exports, which will be taxed by the EU. In this case, the scenario for the pound is not impossible to be below the 1.0 value bar. Nevertheless, the likelihood of this scenario at present is 10%. It is therefore more likely, following the current Brexit events, that the pound will be between 1.10 and 1.20 for 1.0 euro on 1 April 2019. However, the great uncertainty of this event does not exclude in any case an average decline in the price, or a very sharp drop in case of No-Deal, which is not out of the odds, even if it is less possible."

For the pound to fall below 1 euro or rising above 1,3 is absolutely unlikely. Even though the possible enter into effect of the Brexit could have a major impact on pund's value, these two extreme cases are, in my opinion, almost impossible. The other considerations necessarlly have to take into account the major economic and politic dynamics that can happen in the next month in Europe and UK - namely, most of all the path the Brexit will take. While in this forecast I won't analyze in lenght all the possibilities, here I reduce the analysis to economic matters - not exactely my field, but it's worth a shot. The resilience of the pound, even in the most turbolent phases of UK politics since 2017, is definetly something to take into account. UK is and will remain a big economy, which in my opinion will be affected by the turbolence deriving from Brexit but not necessarily in a catastrophic way. Moreover, a macroeconomic dynamic has to be taken into account: while the effects of the Brexit could lower the pound's value, the expenses deriving from the deal - if the deal remains the one stipulated, which is debatable, the UK will have to pay around 36 billions to the EU - will produce a reduction in the availabilty of pounds on the currency market, which in macroeconomics means an increase in the pound's value. If the UK's export, on the other side, will suffer for the exit from the EU, this would lead to a decrease in the pound's value to compensate the exports' reduction. All in all, wether the Brexit will be delayed (which would lead to a more or less stability in the exchange rate) or the Brexit will happen the 29th of this month the pound will be stable. In the even of a no deal, the pound could depreciate slightly (20% to the second option)"

First, the below 1 Euro and above 1.30 Euro I gave a 0% chance, so neither will be used as Bayesian mathematics doesn’t change already existing 0% or 100% predictions. First, I gave a 10% chance of the Pound being above 1.20 Euro. I made this based on the assumption that the UK pulled off Brexit successfully (which is my conditional). Currently, GJ Open says that there is a 26% chance of this happening. When Bayes Theorem is applied, it now gives a 3.76% chance. Since I applied the possibility of a false conditional to both by 1-1.10 Euro percentage and 1.10-1.20 Euro percentage, I then proportionally redistributed the reduced chance of ending above 1.20 to these other categories."

In this case, rate keeps as expected as reduced uncertainty. 30%. - Amended deal is not approved, but changes in parliament procedures pass and force an extension, removing the no-deal option. Probably coming together with snap election or second Brexit election. Most likely scenario, with a minor depreciation of the pound which could be slightly over or under the 1.10. 45% of less than 5% drop, or just 1.10... and 5% over 5%. - Leave with no-deal option on March 29th, total uncertainty, more than 10% drop. 10%. - Just the door open for other options, but very unlikely."

In general, expertise performs badly in these situations too. The first question I need to answer is: will any amount of research I can do allow me to out perform the market. Although I don't agree that markets are perfectly efficient they are closer to a random walk than a predictable trend. If ""the crowd"" believed that Euros would be more valuable on 1st of April than today anyone with spare money or who could borrow it should buy Euros today, the demand would go up leading to price going up, until the price is marginally lower than the expected price on that day. The fact that the price of a Euro now is 86p suggests that the best guess as to the price of euros on 1st April is 86p. I have allowed for wide variation in price given the unlikeness of anyone government to intervene to a heroic degree to interfere with market forces."
