Sounds like RCN is threatening escalation but not specifically threatening more strikes in the short term. The article below assesses ""next couple of weeks"", so that does lend support to a higher probability, but doesn't guarantee that the announced days will fall in February with 15 days left. They also might back off the threats or the gov might give a bit and restart negotiations."

13662,2023-01-20T00:43:04Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],The strike action organised by the RCN of 2 days a month has been consistent. Nurses lose pay when striking so this provides a natural limit to increasing the number of days. Because nurses provide critical services to citizens strike action interrupts these services and increasing the number of days over 2 increases risks of losing public support for the strike action and therefore pay increases.

No evidence that they added previously to months December or January. But will have to monitor the success of these strikes. There also doesn't seem to be any weekdays strongly favored. I guess if these strikes are very successful this time around, there will be no strikes. If guess if these strikes are very successful this time around, perhaps more dates would be added. But there is a tradeoff: by adding them with lots of lead time, you allow people to make plans to attend these strikes. If we don't see them being added soon, I think the ship will sail."
