Apollo is available on a GitHub repository, where developers can download the code, modify it, and suggest changes to Baidu. Developers who want to contribute to the Apollo source code must ""fork"" the repository. For more information on GitHub ""forks,"" visit GitHub's tutorial on the topic. This question will be resolved using Apollo's GitHub repository, which provides an ongoing tally of ""forks"" in the top right corner. Confused? Check our FAQ or ask us for help.

It is an interesting topic and I'd expect it to get some traction in the coming month. 2-3k forks is a lot and it strongly depends on the ""long tail"" of hardly contributing people. I.e. if even a handful of universities use it in a course this winter term this could add a thousand forks or only a handful, depending on how they organise it. We'll have to see how it looks in November"

Especially as they already have 1,107 in just 2 months."

If you look at some of the most forked repositories, a few of them are required for coursework on places like Coursera. Baidu has said it wants to partner with universities, and if that happens it could really move the needle. But without lots of academic participation, I don't see this number moving too dramatically.
