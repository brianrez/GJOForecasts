But I'm pretty sure that without COVID-19 restrictions in China, which anyway make it impossible to hold sports tournaments, the WTA would have been silent in this whole matter. So COVID will be still with us for a while and with it comparatively harsh Zero Covid measurements especially now as it turns out that the Chinese vaccines are not working against Omikron so nothing else left than continued lock downs. But I guess this is not the end of the story. I expect the relations between PRC and the West and the US in particular are going to deteriorate further, after the coming up Winter Olympics the PRC is acting more and more agressive towards Taiwan and further repressive against the Uigurs and other etnic minorities within their borders. My clue is the WTA is at one point to face a uncomfortable decision, when COVID is finally gone (or more likely be treated as a seasonal disease like the flu) wether to give up China as lucrative market or dealing with boycotts by players and fans in the Western world. My guess is WTA is not going to lift the suspension, but I think it won't in the first half of 2022 earliest in autumn. I give it a 22% chance for lift before 1 December 2022.

The CCP will probably wait for the world to move on from the story and create a narrative that refutes the allegations and demands the WTA take back its demands. Which is highly unlikely. There is still a good chance the WTA reaches some sort of agreement for the safety of Peng Shuai, but not unsure what that deal might look like if the CCP wants to sweep this under the rug."

The players do not like playing in China and are happy to be out. The WTA final in Guadalajara was a huge success, loved by fans and the players. I do not think the release of Peng Shuai will affect this position. The WTA has taken principled stands before and are unlikely to back down. Further they are finding ways to not have to go back. The only reason I give it 20% is because of the huge amount of money at stake."

This would seem highly out of character and would involve a huge loss of face after their public steps so far, and so seems extremely unlikely. (2%) - or there would have to be enough financial pressure on the WTA for it to relent and lift its suspension with only some symbolic, face-saving measure. This would represent a surprising miscalculation from the WTA - it seems unlikely they expected to have enough clout to force China's hand. (But perhaps this is a possibility, given that men's tennis didn't follow suit with the suspension - it's possible the WTA expected to find support and not be out on such a limb). (15%)"
