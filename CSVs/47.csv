However, we can do slightly more work to give a better answer. Looking all the way back to 1999, October has always had more checks than August (removing 2020 and 2021 as outliers). On average, October has had ~17% (sample average) more checks than August with a sample standard deviation of ~12%. Being extremely lazy and assuming the data follows a normal distribution (it doesn't but eh it's close-ish) we can put 95% of the probability above 0%.
