Anything just under 14.8% should round to 47%, i.e. still in bin3. Then considering lower figures, I think bin2 is possible, as anything around 6.5-8.5% gain would round to 44%. So the problem is partly not having much recent data to work with and partly due to the single figure rounding. I think the result will be 9-11% gain overall, so I'm reverting back to a similar split to previous."

Their percentages for previous years are about the same as The Infinite Dial's, but they call 117.8M 40%, whereas The Infinite Dial calls 116M 41%. They predict 42% for 2022, which would probably correspond to ~43% for The Infinite Dial, although there could be some rounding issue. Their curve looks nice and smooth and concave down, but that's because they left out all the years before 2018, which have accelerated growth. Sure, it's going to be an S curve, but have we really hit the inflection point yet? I'm not sure. One thing I like about their graph is that they give one significant figure after the decimal point. https://www.emarketer.com/content/realm-of-podcasting-us-global-leader-all-respects Hedging lower again because I'm not sure."

Their Q2 2021 financials show: - 2.9M podcasts in Q2, compared to 2.2M in Q1 - Q2 Monthly Active Users (MAUs) grew 22% YoY – from 299M to 365M (although that includes all streaming not just podcasts) - ""The percentage of MAUs that engaged with podcast content on our platform improved modestly relative to Q1"" - Their target, with a lot of uncertainty, is 400-407M MAUs at year end (globally and not specific to US) Separately there is some short term potential for churn in subscribers due to price increases/structure changes"

As I understand the question, we're asked what estimate it will be in the 2022 report. The increase in trend seems to be slowing - 5% rise then 4% last time around. So a 3% rise seems reasonable for 2021-22? That would take us to 44% (which makes sense when you look at how the question is framed). So I'm torn between going bigger on 42-44 or 44-48. On one hand, greater range to go for in 44-48, however, what will be the content that drives listening for the next year? I'm presuming that over the last couple of years, political podcasts would have been popular with the end of the Trump presidency. Is politics going to be 'more boring' this year meaning fewer podcasts being listened to?"
