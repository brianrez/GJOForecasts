State-owned energy utility Corpoelec has allegedly defaulted on a bond interest payment worth more than US$650 million, according to Reuters. The news agency cited a statement from the bond’s trustee, Wilmington Trust. “The issuer’s failure to pay interest on the notes when due on October 10, 2017 constitutes a default under the indenture,” Wilmington reportedly stated in notice posted on the Luxembourg stock exchange. Wilmington didn’t provide further details, while Corpoelec has denied it has defaulted. The company stated it made the payment on November 8, a day before it was due. President Nicolas Maduro had previously announced plans to restructure some of his government’s debt, with talks with investors set to take place on Monday. If confirmed, the default won’t automatically trigger further defaults, and according to experts any lawsuit stemming from the payment failure would likely be directed at Corpoelec – not the government itself. Maduro has long dismissed speculation his government could itself be facing default. Venezuela’s government and state enterprises like PDVSA collectively owe around US$143 billion in foreign debt, according to financial thinktank Torino Capital. PDVSA alone has around US1.6 billion in debt payments due by the end of the year, and another US$9 billion on bond servicing set to fall in 2018."" its a swamp see @dsarin This is disputed.https://venezuelanalysis.com/news/13498 Now we here from Maduro https://venezuelanalysis.com/news/13498 he banned naked women in defäúlt funny man the last refuge of sĉoundréls is moräls this shoúld resolvé it thänks @Gibson @Wildwood2000 @dsarin"

The debt load is so high that it cannot be refinanced 140-billion ""might have taken longer than some market players expected, but Venezuela finally announced this week it will seek to restructure its global debt; one estimate puts the overseas debt owed by the government and state entities at about $143 billion, including some $52 billion in bonds. The Latin American country had long struggled to avoid default. The local economist who had urged President Nicolas Maduro to default is now concerned that any restructuring will be very painful, and may do little to help the country as a whole. The government did say that state-run oil company PDVSA was making payments that fell due late October, which may relieve some traders. The saga left Mark Mobius happy he had stayed away ever since Hugo Chavez came to power in 1999."" www.bloomberg.com/markets Supporting link..www.nytimes.com citing eurasia group analysts"

However, in this case, with Russia being Maduro's ally, I expect Zero Hedge to carry Putin's water, er, oil. Currently, Zero Hedge is continuing to assert that that there is no default looming before the forecast horizon. In addition, financial news sites have been carrying headlines warning of default since practically forever, so I'm seeing little boy who cried wolf syndrome. Indeed, the base rate for Venezuela default is essentially zero, with the last default in 1982, 35 years ago. Therefore the base rate of one in 35 years turns into ~0.6% between now and the forecast horizon. Therefore, I'm holding at zero probability.

I should warn you that I was worse than average on the last two questions concerning Venezuelan debt obligations. I am flattered by your confidence but you might want to consider aligning your prediction with someone else on this one. The Bloomberg and Townhall stories in particular give me pause. There is just so little reliable data available to the general public. Those who have it and are trading on it certainly won't share it. I am dropping from 76 to 70 but really feel in over my head on this question.

Credit ratings value the risk of default towards creditors, not whether the population is starving for lack of basic supplies, and Venezuela is still one of the richest countries in terms of oil reserves, they just do not know to administer it. Credit rating of PDVSA is directly linked to the rating of the country, and once the country is downgraded a downgrade for PDVSA will be automatic. In case Maduro will come down, no one would like to bury the hope for a change by a downgrade (except Putin and the Arabian oil producers, maybe), and given the history with Venezuela, which lingers since a couple of years, it does not look like credit rating will be used to force Maduro out of office. Time: seven months to go. Greece did not fail because it could sell the country's assets, Venezuela still can do the same. These will be scary months for Venezuela, but not enough for default.
