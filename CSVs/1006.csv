This is expectation was reinforced by the PRM's strong results in the March municipal elections. Current President Danilo Medina (2012-2020, PLD) did not seek a constitutional amendment to enable a third consecutive term in July 2019. Former President Fernandez alleged fraud in the PLD primary in October 2019, which split the party, and municipal polls were postponed to March from February due to electronic voting problems, pointing to potential governability risks surrounding July's vote, which was delayed from May as a social distancing measure. Fitch expects macro policy continuity. However, in Fitch's view, prospects for three key stalled reforms -- public finances, central bank recapitalization (although the executive submitted a proposal to congress), and electricity utility losses -- are uncertain depending on the extent to which the next president will need to balance interest groups in the likely more diversified congress."

The basics - the PLD has won the last four elections, the sitting president retains a fairly high degree of support, and the country boasts solid economic growth over their tenure as leaders of the government. The country also has reduced the amount of unemployment over the last few years. A primary change driver in this case is the ability of the PLD to remain unified and transition its leadership to a new candidate. The new candidate in this case is Gonzalo Castillo, but there are challenges to his leadership from former PLD president Leonel Fernandez and allegations of corruption against Castillo while he served as minister of public works and communication. This was compounded by an earlier attempt to change the constitution allowing Medina to run for a third term. These developments, among others, will likely impact the unity of the PLD vote in May. A second change factor is the unity and experience of the opposition. In this case, polls from fall of 2019 indicate Luis Abinader's national exposure and experience have served him well and currently place him in the lead with 47% support (just under the 50% necessary for a 1st round win). The last factor to consider here is the form of the election. A potential 2 step process that starts with all candidates competing and looking for 50% of the vote. If no candidate achieves the 50% threshold, it moves to a run off between the top two candidates. Abinader would likely prefer a 1st round win to avoid PLD consolidation around a single candidate; however, winning in the first round is more difficult. Brookings analysis of two step elections indicate the 1st round winner usually wins the run off, unless the 1st round winner is considered ""the greater evil"". In this case the population tends to rally with the safer candidate. All this to say - based on his previous result in the last election, current polling numbers, and current issues within the PLD point to Abinader as the 2020 winner."

Big Cement, no-go zone for journos and NGOs for fear of wearing cement shoes . A Peruvian non-scientific poll mentioned by Bedouincafe puts Abinader as the front runnerbut that poll IMO, is problematic. Fitch Risk (a sister company to Fitch Credit) has indicated Leonel as front runner. And suggests that trial of DR pols in connection with Odebrecht (Brazil) corruption case (influence pedding, corrupt practices in the DR) could be a factor."
