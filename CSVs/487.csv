(It was a little under a month in March, but almost exactly 30 days right now.) I also agree with him that the J&J vaccine isn't moving much, and that its effects are likely to be pretty negligible on the forecast total."

So I'm centering in the 140s with some chance it hits lower or higher. J&J vaccinations have become basically negligible now unfortunately, so I'm not putting much weight on the possibility of J&J vaccinations boosting the fully vaccinated numbers higher."
