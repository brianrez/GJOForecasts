There were three separate events which resulted in a total of 14 deaths and all perpetrators were in the unknown classification. The two targeted assassinations were of environmental activists and both occurred in March of last year. An attempted assassination of an environmental activist occurred July, 4 of this year. There also may be a power vacuum with the recent conviction and looming extradition of drug kingpin 'Chepe Handal'. I believe there is a chance for gang violence or another assassination of an environmentalist."
