Based on this data one can state that there is a very low probability that either of the articles will be invoked by the 1st of January 2020. There seems to be a rather high threshold among the NATO member state in general to invoke the articles, meaning that a serious rise in tensions or a single/number of serious events would need to occur before the states would even consider invoking."

Article 5 has so far only been invoked once after the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the US (https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm). I do not believe that Russia will attack any NATO member state with armed forces within the next seven months, even though it is hard to predict. The one thing necessary to consider, however, is invoking Art. 5 on grounds of a cyber attack stemming from Russia against one of the NATO - members, as cyber attacks, as well, are included in Art. 5 of the Washington Treaty (https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/nato-updates-policy-offers-members-article-5-protection-against-cyber-attacks ; https://www.nato-pa.int/download-file?filename=sites/default/files/2019-04/087_STC_19_E%20-%20NATO.pdf). A cyber attack stemming from Russia is a credible threat (https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/2019-ATA-SFR---SSCI.pdf). Yet, in light of the current publications of the Mueller report and the unveiling of Russia's probable involvement in the 2016 US elections a cyber threat is not very probable right now, considering Russia is already under watch. As well, Russia is in no direct conflict currently with any NATO member state which would give reason for attack (even though of course reason is not necessarily needed). Furthermore, if a cyber attack were to occur it is not necessarily clear where it originates from, hence even if Russia were to issue a cyber attack against one NATO member state it might not even be disclosed immediately. Overall, invoking Art. 5 seems unlikely to me."

The Article 5 stipulates that “the Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them […] will assist the Party or Parties […]” (ibis.). The article has been invoked once since the establishment of the alliance when the US called its NATO allies after the 9/11 terror attacks. The Article 6 complements Article 5 by providing clarity about what constitutes an “armed attack” (ibis.). It defines that an attack on the “territory of any of the Parties” and/or “on the forces, vessels, or aircraft of any of the Parties” justify the invoking of Article 5. It is extremely unlikely that Russia would dare to attack a NATO member as it would face the whole NATO alliance. Furthermore, the deployment of allied troops along the eastern border of the NATO (especially the Baltics) decreases the probability that Russia would try to use the infamous “little green men” tactic as it did in Ukraine. As a result, and despite recently growing tensions, this forecast assesses a X < 1% probability for this scenario to occur."

Article 5 is a keystone of the whole NATO organisation while Article 4 is limited to consultations solely if the country feels that its independence or security is threatened.

Two things to consider are Russia-Ukraine war and cyber attacks. Regarding the first, it is one of the possible scenarios why Article 4 could be invoked again. However, even if suddenly Russia highly increases the military actions in Ukraine, it is unlikely to expect NATO involvement. Even though Ukraine is a NATO partner but as we can see from previous cases, comments being a partner or being an actual member to whom NATO is committed to highly changes the plan of actions. Cyber attacks could be a possible trigger to invoke Article 4, however, it is not a secret that cyber attacks are still considered to be a new way of war and NATO is still working on definition of understanding what actions should be considered severe enough to invoke the Article 4 or even 5. Hence, I do not expect any significant statements before 2020."

Secretary General of NATO announced that cyber attack can trigger article 5. That means that in reality it also can trigger consultations as stated in Article 4. Russian cyberattacs has become a common thing and meddling in the election procces can reach its high during election to the European Parlament in the end of May. That suggests that baseline should go up.

Article 5 states that an attack against a State member of NATO is an attack against all of the members, and sets the possibility of collective-defence, using the necessary tools (military or not). So far in history, it has been invoked only once after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Personally, I can’t imagine any possibility of a military or terroristic attack caused by Russia before the 1st January 2020, because no-one would gain any advantage from it, still less Russia. In spite of Russia being a global power, NATO is the most powerful military alliance existent which Russia has better not to challenge. Russia doesn’t have enough economic neither military power to face the eventual countermeasures taken by the entire NATO community, and I’m talking both about hard measures as military intervention and economic ones, like sanctions (which it is already suffering because of the Crimea issue). About Ukraine issue: a military intervention by Russia has already occurred (I’m referring to Crimea war), but Ukraine is not a NATO country and I don’t think is going to be part of it by next year. First of all, the domestic policy is too fragile now, the citizens are divided between pro-Europe and pro-Russia, plus the next president is likely to be Zelensky, quite close to Crimea requests and slightly filo-Russian. Neither the NATO would like to include it in its alliance in such a short amount of time and without any guarantee of stability in the country."

67625,2019-04-08T18:03:20Z,1,[8.0],[8.0],"First of all, I want to point out that the following analysis focuses only on the formal invocation of article 4 of the NATO charter. Article 5 pertains armed attacks against a NATO member, and I consider the probability of such event before 1 January 2020 absolutely unlikely. The last consideration derives from the facts that: - article 5 has been invoked only once, by the US after 9/11. As such, article 5 has never been invoked after a direct attack from a country to a NATO member - the scenario in which Russia decides to directly attack a NATO member is extremely unlikely, for the very reason that it's a NATO member and because of the very existence of article 5. It's not in Russian interest - or in any state's - to ignite the collective countermeasures linked to an armed attack to a member state, NATO is still the most powerful military alliace in the world, and in the foreseeable future the world military lead will be held by the US and the NATO system. (Probability: 0%). Moving on, it is necessary to fully understand what are the possible reasons which could lead to a formal invocation of article 4. The latter is: ""The Parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened."" (for the consultation, see https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_17120.htm). This article is much broader in meaning in comparison with article 5: first of all, it refers to every member's opinion about what they feel threatening. While every state has their own ""national style"" in detecting possible threats deriving from their interests and positions, we can assume that a formal invocation of article 4 would follow a threat recognized among all NATO members as such. While there isn't a checklist of all threats considered as such on a NATO level, we know that ""during the 1990s NATO significantly broadened the range of what it now considers to be security challenges: cybersecurity, instability beyond NATO’s borders, terrorism, energy security, health risks, climate change and water scarcity are explicitly mentioned in the 2010 Strategic Concept, something probably unthinkable only fifteen years before"" (http://www.act.nato.int/images/stories/events/2015/acor/ac15_final.pdf, page 5. For an overlook on NATO's strategic concept, see https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_56626.htm and https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_27433.htm). With this insight, we can assume that, with the right motivation and drivers, any threatening behaviour Russia could assume in the next months against a NATO member could lead to an article 4's invocation. Basically, it's impossible to restrict the analysis this way. It is more useful to invert the question: which perceived threats against NATO members could be Russia responsible for in the next months? First of all, I want to start with Ukraine, which is not a NATO member, but it could become one very soon - NATO-Ukrain relationships became increasingly closer after the Crimea's invasion (see https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_37750.htm). Ukraine is currenlty under elections. Both possible future presidents - Petro Poroshenko and Volodymyr Zelenskiy - are, to different degrees, pro EU and pro NATO. Nevertheless, we can expect that for Ukrain to join NATO will take a while - the most probable elections' winner, Zelenskiy, is willing to make a referendum over joining NATO, which obviously will take time (https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2019-04-02/will-comic-actor-become-ukraines-next-president). For these reasons, I don't think Ukraine will even have the possibility to invoke any NATO article sooner than the 1 January 2020 (probability: 0%). I started with Ukraine because it's the only country near the NATO influence zone affected by direct Russian armed violence. For the actual NATO member's analysis, I will try to outline which main threats they could perceive from Russia in the next months. Russia is one of the main Euroean energy supplier and, as already stated, NATO members can perceive as a threat the loss of energy security. In the event in which Russia - for any reason - threatens or actually decide to cut energetic supplies to Europe, NATO members could decide to invoke article 4. This scenario is extremely unlikely for several reasons: the energetic dependency corresponds to a Russian economic dependency from energetic revenues, which would mean very bad Russian economic performance, which is something you don't really want when elections approach - even if Russian elections are questinable in matters of democratic procedures. Moreover, Russia threatening Europe or actually blocking the supplies is a scenario we already saw (https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/world/europe/07gazprom.html) without the invocation of article 4. (probability: 0%). Another source of threat could be a perceived threat after Russian strategies of nuclear intimidation. I won't really argument about this, I just think it won't happen at all (probability: 0%). Another source of threat could be about environmental security. Denmark is currently blocking Gazprom's North Stream 2 by advancing possible environmental problems linked with the project. Nevertheless, Russia has a plan B (https://russiabusinesstoday.com/energy/denmark-still-deciding-on-nord-stream-2-approval/) which will likely imply the same environmental issues (the pipelined would only not pass through Denmark's exclusive economic zone, but really near). This could lead Denmark to invoke article 4. I just don't think that this issue could lead Denmark to take such a strong stand against Russian interests and projects, it would have several diplomatic implications and countereffects. Moreover, article 4 in the past has never been invoked for environmental issues (probability: o%). Another source of perceived threats could arise from Russian military exercises, most of all for European countries near the Russian borders (all NATO members). If those countries feel threatened by the military display - which could be understandable with the Ukranian situation - they could invoke article 4. As military exercises are not foreseeable (and definetly not scheduled in documents I have the access to), I would say that it could be possible, but military exercises has never been motive of article 4's invocation (probability: 0,5%). The last two sources of possible perceived threat I could think of are interlinked, and, in my opinion, the most relevant. Russia is well known, or at least it's suspected, to have cyber camapaigns and intelligence operations aimed at influencing foreign countries' policies, most of all in the event of elections - one of the most direct influences you can have over a country's policy is by trying to make a candidate/party whose program is in line with your interests win the elections. In 2019, there will be many elections (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_elections_in_2019, Europe section). The occasion for cyber attacks are definetly incalculable, the interests which could lead Russia to adopt them in any NATO member state are incalculable as well - at least, I don't have the expertise to do such assessment. Moreover, a NATO member, given the new broad threat dimension outlined in the aforementioned 2010's NATO strategy, could decide to invoke article 4 after an especially severe cyber attack, or if intromissions in national elections were found. The latter two possibilities, though, would be difficult to demonstrate to be Russian-led, and even so, they could not lead to the invocation to article 4 - a national investigation, a UN inquiry, or a bilateral peaceful confrontation could happen instead - (probability: 5.5%). Adding the future events' probabilities underlined until here leads me to think to a 6% probability of a NATO member invoking article 4 in response to actions taken by Russia. I added a precautios 2% because of unforeseeable factors and possible scenarios - or simply scenarios I couldn't think of."

The chance of something of an event of this nature happening in the time period to a NATO country is assumed as 50%, and assumes that probability of invoking either article is low at 20% even if that happens - implies 10% overall"

I think it is noteworthy that even during the cold war, those articles were not invoked due to actions taken by Russia (were they even invoked at all during the cold war?). So it appears that any Russian action is carefully planned to ensure to not trigger NATOs alarm bells. The residual probability I forecast is due to mishaps or misjudgements, for example a cyber attack that was supposed to remain unattributable, or some severe worsening of NATO-Russia relations."

We've got 1.5 yrs to go = 12.9%.

Maybe. The insider view is rife with contradictions. Trump is unpopular, but NATO countries are increasing their military budgets which has been a US request across the past 3 administrations. Turkey is more disconnected from the US and NATO than ever, but it is the source of most article invocations. 5) Does Putin like stir the pot? Yes. Will he seek create opportunities that Russia can exploit? Yes. Is the current environment a target rich environment? Yes. Should we be concerned that NATO or the US will not exhibit the will to confront an incorrigible Russian? Yes. Those all tack on percentage points, but I don't know how to quantify how much. 6) Crowd consensus is currently 5% I'm going to come in just a bit higher than that for now and go with just under my original baseline."

Despite the tensions that currently comprise West-Russia relations, the post-Cold War military order remains relatively stable for now. If there is going to be a crisis, it would more than likely be relegated to the diplomatic sphere and there is a low chance that it will result in a military conflict. First, it is important to note that despite the loaded dialogues, NATO in general is not as combat ready to fight a large scale war like the one with Russia. Since the end of the Cold War, NATO forces in Europe have been greatly reduced despite the increase in member states. Most weaponry of NATO member states, including the US, has shifted to conducting successful operations against militarily weak states, as was the case in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The same reductions are also seen in Russia, whose forces pale in comparison to the height of the Warsaw Pact. A more important reason would be that both NATO and Russia do not have a strong will to fight. In terms of a military response, NATO merely stood and watched as Russia went to war in Georgia, annexed Crimea, and became militarily involved in Donbass. This has sent a clear message to Eastern member states that they may not be able to adequately rely on NATO for help in case of a military conflict. Even though NATO sent forces in Poland and the Baltics, this was done more for political rather than military reasons, as the forces sent are not nearly enough to adequately respond to a large-scale conflict. Russia, as well, is also unprepared for such as large-scale conflict. Although Russia has engaged in a massive military modernization program since the presidency of Putin, Russia's expertise has also been relegated to small scale conflicts such as in Georgia and Ukraine. Many cite the annexation of Crimea as a part of Russia's imperial ambitions, but even Russia is reasonable and knows that it would be economic and military suicide to attempt and restore Russia to the boundaries of the Soviet Union. Despite Russia's annexation of Crimea, Crimeans remain largely loyal to Russia and see Russia as a liberator and Crimea is also a very small territory. If Russia was to go on a campaign of Eastern Europe, it would not only be a huge military and economic cost that would lead to WW3, but even if Russia was successful, it would have to deal with a very hostile population. Russia is also mostly a paper tiger, as we have seen Turkey shoot down a Russian military aircraft, which did not result in a serious military conflict, despite the aggressive rhetoric from the Kremlin."

35117,2018-04-17T18:25:47Z,1,[24.0],[24.0],"Let's start with a look at the base rate. Argument 1: Russian aggression has only led once to invocation of Article 4 since 1991, and that was in 2014, on the back of the Ukraine crisis. 1/27 is just about an annualised 3.7%. There's just under 20 months to go so let's round down and call it 6% during the forecast period. As an alternative take however, if we say that Russia has been notably more assertive since 2008 (August War) then that’s one prompting of Article 4 due to Russian action since then which is annualised 10% * (20/12) = 16.7%. This seems a reasonable start to bracketing it. Since an assertive Russia is what we are dealing with, I am leaning towards the higher rate in the current international environment."

These are: 1. The rapid increase of military might of China, which will add on to the already high level of the Russian armed forces; 2. The developing economical relations between EU and the The Eurasian Economic Union (officially EAEU), along with decreasing US influence all over the world, especially ME; 3. China's crude oil trade in Yuan of a new crude oil brand, which started recently, which undermines US$ role as world reserve currency. The empire being in agony, is knowingly a dangerous historical period. Depending on the level of responsible actor as a nuclear super power, or the lack of it, which the US and some of it's allies (vassals) have actually shown in recent past, the elites may make a yet another faulty step, which might trigger a military response of the Russian Federation. This would indeed mean the invocation of the NATO articles in question. A direct confrontation of both nuclear super powers military would very likely trigger an uncontrollable military escalation, which could mean the begin of WW3. Einstein was once asked, how WW3 may look like. He answered, that he wouldn't know how WW3 would look like, but knew how WW4 would be fought - with stones and sticks. Therefore, if thought about it reasonably, there should be a clear Zero % probability this to happen. However, similar as it was before WW2, the West construed a false picture of the then completely isolated USSR. All the public was influenced by means of media and intelligence assessments, that it would take the Germans 3-6 weeks to defeat the USSR. Especially the assessments of UK and USA have influenced Hitler, who by all means was not an adventurist, but received hereby an imagination, that he would be able to finish up USSR very quickly. When the started in 1941 on June 22nd, the German army didn't have proper winter attire, since it was assumed to beat the Soviet army till the cold winter. The end of the story we know. USSR has absorbed 80% of all combat in whole WW2, lost almost 30 millions citizens, but has over come Hitlers army, which was comprised by all European nations and its industries. US, through it's industries supplied Hitler till the end of the WW2 - GM-Opel, as an example. Therefore, the risk is evident, that this time the fake image the US media is portraying in regards to the state of military and its economy, the elite may conclude, that Russia will be an easy pray. I hope the reason will prevail, and the US elite will understand the suicidal path it will be, if Russia will have to respond militarily."
