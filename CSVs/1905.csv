In mid-July, I started as an optimist, believing that the PSOE cannot afford to be blamed for causing new elections and will yield, probably by a few abstentions. However, at that time I didn't know (i) about the regional elections on Sep 25, and (ii) that even if the Aug 31-Sep 2 attempt to form a government fails, there will be another chance (by Oct 31) to form a government before new elections are triggered. The turning point for me was the PSOE leadership decision to wait out the regional elections. Then I realized that a government before that will be seen as a defeat for the PSOE, so they cannot afford to allow that (unless there were a revolt, but this didn't happen)."

There will be good pressure on Sanchez from MPs in vulnerable districts to allow abstentions at the second investiture vote coming up this week and thus postpone new elections until the Spring of 2017 (at least), or until such time as another PP corruption scandal erupts. For now, I am thinking there is still a 50/50 chance Sanchez allows MPs to vote their conscience and abstain if necessary. If Sanchez votes ""no"" at the second investiture later this week and if the PSOE loses in the by-elections this fall, there is a very good chance someone else will be leading the PSOE at the December elections."

Moreover, they can chose the time and manner of the demise of the minority government (as it would need Socialist support in a confidence vote).

While voters prepare for an election rerun, the major parties will, no doubt, be neck deep in negotiations, looking for ways to avoid another stalemate. If, as expected, the newly formed Unidos Podemos alliance surges to a clear second place, will the PSOE be prepared to make a deal with PP as the lesser of two evils? It's likely - they would appear to have very little to gain from a third vote. Polls may be suggesting a similar outcome to December's election, but that's by no means certain. School holidays may favor PP and disadvantage Podemos. The Brexit vote is 3 days beforehand. Obama is visiting in July. The democratic process is at risk if the electorate loses faith in the value of their vote. And then there's EU pressure over the tanking economy. . . It's a far more complex and uncertain situation than my forecast suggests, but there is a real need for resolution and if that means a couple of parties need to make concessions, so be it."

But the right x left balance is virtually unchanged. However, as a third election is so undesirable to all political actors, PSOE could abstain and allow a minority PP (or PP-Ciudadanos) government. Must admit that confidence is low and I'm ready to change my mind at first evidence of change in polls."
10898,2016-06-07T20:27:03Z,1,[40.0],[40.0],"As it stands, the polls (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_Spanish_general_election,_2016) predict results similar to the December 2015 election albeit with the the Podemos led alliance in second place, instead of PSOE. This means no party has enough to form a government on its own, and more importantly no two left parties or right parties (categorizing Cuidadanos as right since they are to the right of Podemos and PSOE) have enough to form a government together. This leaves two possibilities: 1- Things change in the next two weeks and either the left or the right ""surges"" ahead to get more than 50% of the seats. Let's assign this event a 40% chance. If it's the right surging ahead (20% of the total), I think it would be easier for PP and Cuidadanos to either form a coalition or to have a PP government propped up by Cuidadanos (15% of the total). Otherwise if it's the left surging ahead (20%), it could be a little harder since chances are PSOE will have to be the junior partner unless Podemos concedes (10%? of the total). In short, while I'm assigning a 40% chance of a left or right tilt, I'm only assigning a 25% chance that this leads to a government."
