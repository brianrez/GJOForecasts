It is likely the Fed will go another .75 bpts higher at the November meeting. I think they will pause raising rates over December and debate/approve a further rise in early 2023. The amount of QE run off from the Fed portfolio between now and year end would equate to a 50bpts rise in Fed Funds rate. This leaves the dot projections consistent with with a headline Discount Rate rise of 4.0%. The funds rate will lead a higher Discount Rate in early 2023.

The Chairman and regional governors have spoken about learning from the experiences of the 70s where there was a minor pause in the CPI rate that came back with a vengeance. This is why I think there is a more than half chance of rates being higher. While they have mentioned they are aiming for a soft-landing, interest rates are blunt tools, which could slow down the economy and if it is sufficiently painful and CPI drops off quick enough I do think there is an off-chance for there to be a pause due to the Christmas season. I would never say something is impossible which is why I added 5% to the chance that the Fed will lower interest rates to support markets, etc."
