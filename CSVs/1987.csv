A party must win at least 5% of the vote nationwide to get a seat in the Duma, in addition to winning any particular seat. One more uncertainty factor -- will the vote be counted honestly?

And, sorry, I cannot provide references for my comments as I rely on sources in Russian. Several points: 1. It looks at least some people are making predictions based on past performance of UR in the last elections and current poll results. But electoral system has changed and you can do that only for half the seats, which are chosen through the past proportional system. It is a new ballgame for the other half, which is based on the majority, or ""first-past-the-post"" system, in which UR will most probably get disproportionately more seats. 2. I suggest - Don't rely on polls that much. In Russia in polls people tend to give higher support to the ruling party then it is - heritage from the communist past. E.g. polls consistently often underestimate support for (some irony here) the Communist party. Besides, it looks that now we see significantly lower portion of people (70%+) who say they will vote for 4 parties that have real chances to get into Duma and are already in the parliament. Before previous elections it was around 90%. But no other parties (besides these 4) are predicted to overcome 5% threshold. So, probably numbers for these 4 parties will change when voters face the reality of their lost votes. 4. Projections for ""first-past-the-post"" system are also complicated: it is already manipulated. UR did not field candidates in 18 out of 225 seats, clearly giving them out to other 3 parties to take. Why? Because other 3 parties in parliament are not opposition: on major issues they vote with the ruling party and the government wants them to continue to do so. And all of it is with the background that this time the government tries to make the vote look more trustworthy. Hence, they may not even want to get over 2/3 in Duma. No need actually, others will give the government the parliamentary support they want. Still, it looks there is a big chance UR may get more than 2/3 of the seats. I am increasing their chances to do that..."

This suggests that roughly the same proportion will go towards UR seats allocated for the proportional part of the election. Add to that, in the ""first past the post"" districts, you are generally likely to be highly over-represented when you are the party with highest percentage of support. This suggests to me that two-thirds is a very real possibility for UR. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_legislative_election,_2016#Opinion_polls for the polls."

It doesn't want a repeat of the electoral fraud of 2011 so this election will be more tightly managed."

Yet as Septemberâs parliamentary elections loom, Vladimir Putin is taking no chances. Widespread fraud during the last such ballot in 2011 sparked the Bolotnaya demonstrations, the largest street protests of his reign. Though the economy is struggling, and the ruling United Russia partyâs popularity fraying, intimidation and emigration have drained the oppositionâs spirits, so mass unrest this time looks unlikely. But why take chances? Before the campaign has even started, the Kremlin has accused foreign governments and media of meddling in it. The long-time head of the central election commission, Vladimir Churov, whom critics called âthe Magicianâ for his dexterity with voting results, has been replaced with the more widely respected human-rights commissioner, Ella Pamfilova. But subtler measures to keep undesirable candidates off the ballots ought to guarantee that the carefully scripted spectacle goes off without a hitch. [From the Economist Espresso] =====NOTE======== On 19 June the State Duma approved the first reading of a bill to bring the election to the State Duma forward from 4 December 2016 to the third Sunday of September in 2016 [keeping in mind the high marks Putin is still enjoying]. According to opposition figures this initiative is explained by the desire of the government to prevent the victory of opposition forces. Polls are giving ove 40% lead to United Russia."

Some articles at the time referred to it as being a loss of face for Putin. Now consider that the Kremlin pretty much controls the media in Russia; Medvedev is the PM; and Putin probably wants to maintain the illusion of a democratic mandate. So will they actually 'allow' anything less than 50% putting control of the Duma (at least on paper) at risk? Think highly unlikely. Gut feel is that will get at least 50%; well will take measures to ensure that they get 50%. Need to also consider how Putin is currently polling; how he polled back in 2011; state of Russian economy; any reliable sources re current polling of the Unit Russia party

There's also been an explosion in small parties and growing discontent with the economic situation, oil prices\embargoes etc so support for United Russia is not solid. To counter the growing discontent the election may have been changed to September, when Russians are on vacation, from the initial date in December in the hopes that smaller turn outs will favour United Russia. Due to all these circumstances, its highly unlikely United Russia could win 2/3 majority of seats , it only has just over 50% now. If vote rigging and fraud is true and general discontent is as great as reported it would create a huge backlash and suspicion if United Russia somehow secured 2/3 of seats. A more plausible election would have United Russia just winning enough seats so as to create a more believable result, if elections are fraudulent. However if elections are more free and the changes to representation don't favour United Russia, but the opposition, it would be possible for them to secure less then half the votes and maybe form a coalition government between United Russia and some minor parties."

In the short term, thugs win elections, of course, so if he backs off United--and especially if he signs on with someone else--things could get pretty strange pretty fast.

That's close to the floor, but I think there is a greater likelihood of something in the 40's (10 percent) than something over two-thirds (5 percent). United Russia won't be using Putin's image in the upcoming election, which will undermine their support. Conversely, the party would need to ride Putin's coattails pretty hard to repeat their 2007 performance (70 percent). Without his image, coupled with the economic situation in Russia (including the effect of the food embargo), corruption charges flying around, and dozens of party members leaving the party since about 2013 or 2014, they'll be closer to 50 than 60."
