I know this is a crude measurement, but if this trend holds true, many more than 200 protestors will be killed. While there is a chance of deescalation, it seems like the protests are just ramping up. Finally, if Iran wanted to break the protestors with an iron fist, as they did in 2009, there would undoubtedly be a number of casualties."

Assuming that means just 50 injured and only 5% die in the next three weeks, that's 2.5 more deaths to the official 185 count, or 187.5 deaths. Let's assume this estimate is underestimating by 3 times, therefore we'll expect 2.5 x 3 deaths, or 7.5 more deaths, or 192.5 total deaths. Let's assume this incident in question is only 12% of all clashes that's going to occur in the next 3 weeks and let's keep the original 2.5 deaths from the @MrLittleTexas report. In other words, 2.5 deaths / .12, or 20.8 more deaths, or 205.8 total deaths at question closing. Assuming Human Rights can detect and report more than 97% of these deaths, we'd be comfortably over the 200 deaths threshold. This can be further refined with further research into fatality rates of riot mobs. But then that is assuming there are no more people to die from previous injuries from previous clashes from last week."

But my current thinking is this earthquake was not catastrophic enough to totally disrupt protesters/rioters. In fact, it may catalyze more chaos and a higher demand for government to put focus on the community. And right now the community seems to feel oppressed, judging by the protests. I heard Iran was once a popular destination place in the '70s, with a more relaxed and inviting regime."
