But not in Japan Key!! https://www.stratfor.com/situation-report/japan-russia-abe-putin-meet-may-6 'Russian President Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will meet May 6 in Sochi, Putin said April 20, Kyodo reported. Putin reportedly did not say whether the talks would cover the issue of the ongoing territorial dispute between Russia and Japan over four Russian-held, Japanese-claimed islands off Hokkaido. The dispute has prevented the two countries from inking a peace treaty following World War II. An unnamed Japanese source confirmed that the meeting is likely to take place. The geopolitical climate taking shape is once again conducive to talks between Moscow and Tokyo"""

A clear diplomatic message by the Russian Govt. doing business w/ Japanese Govt. has a higher priority than the previous disagreements. The quote by Deputy Prime Minister Morgulov reference political differences ""need to be freed as soon as possible"" signals time is of the essence, at least from the Russians. Which is consistent with Putins increasingly difficult geopolitical and domestic calculations. With no real OPEC agreement on limiting oil production on the horizon ( NB: upcoming meeting looks fraught w/ uncertainties), Putin will from a domestic perspective can argue internally to Russians ""job well done for the time being in Russian"". That said, the gap left by the price of oil today relative to their ongoing budget requirements leaves Russia still close to dire economic straights. Carrying out his shorter term Syrian objectives had substantial financial cost as well. And, one might argue, both the naval and, military base in Tartus will continue to generate substantial cost. Clearly, a significant interest to his overall ME strategy. Putin now stepping back for the time being in Syria will not be enough to generate a return to reasonable economic conditions. He needs to show internally he has proper plans in place to improve economic development in Russia."

Hunting for the right information, I began with the simple statement made by the Russian government: “We do not see any possibility to take part in the preparations for the Fourth Summit on Nuclear Security.” Russia is known to be controversial in many of their views, so I started at what I consider a high 20% likelihood based on this statement alone. After some more research, it became clear that Russia sent their foreign minister to attend in 2014, and since then Russia has stated no new agenda items have come up that would instill a desire to participate. Looking further back at these summits, Putin has never actually attended, leading no reason to believe he would attend this year. Combined with Putin’s hothead personality who doesn’t go back on statements, I reduced the forecast to 6%. In reasoning, however, I also looked to other key players who can influence this decision in the opposite direction. Specifically, North Korea recently tested a hydrogen bomb. Because of Putin’s proximity to North Korea and the global concern with their tactics, he might feel compelled to attend the summit and play a dominating role about how to curb North Korea (likely with some underlying political interests here). Because of this possibility, I slightly adjusted the likelihood of attendance upwards to 9%."

The talks would focus on the Southern Kuril territorial dispute, according to the report. The beginning of arrangements for such a trip is in response to an invitation extended to Abe by Putin to visit a local city in Russia other than Moscow, when the two leaders held talks in November, the news agency, cited its sources as saying. Russia and Japan will begin preparations for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s 2016 visit to a Russian region with deputy foreign minister-level talks in February 2016, NHK news reported on Dec. 30. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov and his Japanese counterpart Shinsuke Sugiyama will discuss Abe’s visit at a meeting in Moscow in February, according to the report. 4-January-2016: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin to resolve ongoing territorial disputes between the two countries. 19-Jan-2016: Abe also said that “as the chair of the G7” he would consider a visit to Russia “at the appropriate time”, which the Nikkei newspaper interpreted as meaning ahead of the G7 summit in May. There's good evidence that the two will meet in Russia in the Spring of 2016, but no evidence that a meeting will take place in Japan."

This particular sentiment has been expressed as providing a solution by not ARMING terror rivals (a prominent partial military solution for the US) but seeking alternative solutions."

In July Mr Shoigu said two garrisons were being built on Kunashir and Iturup - the main islands in the group near Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island. Japan protested when Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev visited Kunashir and Iturup in August. The Kurils are called the Northern Territories in Japan.

Putin is using Syria and Ukraine as bargaining chips to end sanctions by the end of January 2016 after which the EU will decide whether or not to extend those sanctions (http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/united-states-vladimir-putin-europe-russia-215401). The sanctions appear likely to continue and the U.S. will do what it can to keep Japan on the side of the G7. Furthermore, Russia's biggest trading partner in the region is China. Russia would want to keep a stronger alliance with China amid sanctions. The island dispute between Russia and Japan will unlikely be resolved making a meeting with Japan even more frivolous.

There are more bubbles in Japan than there is nuclear radiation.

Putin and Abe met at the 2014 APEC summit, and postponed a Putin visit in 2014 due to US pressure over Ukraine. Japan, under pressure, also placed sanctions on Russia. They agreed to postpone until an appropriate time in 2015. Putin and Abe again met at the 2015 UN general Assembley in September. They agreed to meet at the G20 and/or APEC summits in November, and Abe issued an invitation for Putin to visit when ""outcomes in the peace negotiations and economic areas could be arraigned"". Everything seemed to depend on progress in Ukraine, except now Syria.... Recent news stories indicate Russia has started to place additional pressure on Japan (likely to improve relations) by visiting the Kuriles and starting construction, etc. This article, dated Oct. 10, 2015, describes the US coming down on Japan for it's negotiations with Russia. http://sputniknews.com/asia/20151010/1028326640/us-concerned-over-japan-russia-talks.html As a result, the indefinite postponement of the visit noted below."

Japan is hosting the G7 next year; Russia is embroiled in Ukraine and Syria. US-Russian tensions will make Abe tread lightly, and there is realistically little for Japan to gain from such a meeting."

Thus, there is really no particular reason to expect a visit to happen. Given that, I am going with an estimate of 15%, even lower than my 25% global base rate.

Whatever it was, it didn't work. Putin and Abe will surely meet, but unlikely it will happen in Tokyo in Q timeframe. WWII still in progress."

They also do not want the coming confrontation in the China Sea between Japan, the US, and China negotiated without them. The less they are involved in world affairs, the less they have to offer and ask from other nations who have more stake in these events, and are now involved in the geopolitical areas of these conficts. In short, if Russia does not assert itself, it will not have enough resources or political capital to buy meaningful membership into world affairs. By meeting with Japan, they have an advantage over China when Russia negotiates with them. China owes them money in areas such as transport and oil, this may encourage China to pay its bills."
