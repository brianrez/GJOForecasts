1333,2020-06-18T14:55:03Z,35,[0.0],[0.0],"The Supreme Court ruled against President Donald Trump on Thursday in a set of cases over his effort to end the Obama-era immigration program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. The opinion was authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative, and joined by the court’s four liberals. Roberts reasoned that the Trump administration’s termination of the program was “arbitrary and capricious,” in violation of federal law that governs administrative procedure. The ruling will protect hundreds of thousands of young immigrants who have been shielded from deportation and allowed to receive work permits under the program. There were about 700,000 DACA recipients at the time Trump ordered the program to wind down in September 2017."

I'm not convinced that all five ""conservative"" justices will be okay with administrative action that is based upon a contrived misreading of executive authority . This is another case that the Chief Justice might see as a threat to the courts as an institution. Let me put it this way, I think Roberts could see the administration's argument as the government thumbing its nose at the courts. Having said that, there are almost certainly 4 yes votes and 4 no votes, and Roberts is also probably leaning toward deference to executive authority in this area, so there is strong chance of a yes answer."
