Looking back as the GJO consensus trend, a week ago the consensus was 56%, but I don't see any great change in the polls between last week and this, so why has the GJO consensus changed so much? I was in Spain last week, but not in Catalonia and could not help but notice the majority view of the rest of Spain, that regards the Catalan independence as somewhere between madness and irritation (my local restaurant has jokingly renamed Crema Catalan on its menu, Crema Valencian). I suspect that the views of my Spanish friends has biased my view of this vote, I think that Catalan Independence would be a crazy complicated outcome. (How many boarder crossings and customs post would be needed?) So I tend to assume that sensible voters would not actually vote for parties that seem to promote chaos, but I have been caught out too many times in the last couple of years by voters who seem to be totally irrational and have voted for people, parties or ideas that have zero chance of achieving the golden future promised to their supporters. Having said that I do suspect that in Catalonia sensible people who want a quiet life are keeping a low profile and would be less likely to tell pollsters they are going to vote for the boring sensible parties and not the exciting, brave independence parties, so I am going for a slightly higher chance of a No than a Yes."

The CUP seems a little on the nose, and polling indicates that they will lose 2-4 seats. Similarly, the JxSi coalition (now fighting separately as ERC and JxCat) seems to be set to lose 0-2 seats."

It is also very likely that those who are anti-independence will most likely be mobilized and come out to vote in greater numbers (and are unlikely to vote for independence). There is a possibility that foreign influence (especially Russian) could attempt to bolster the pro-independence parties as Russian meddling was a factor in the referendum (as it has been with other separatist movements such as Kuwait)"
