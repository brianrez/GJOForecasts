"Will more than 6,000 new battery electric vehicles be registered in Germany in the third quarter of 2016?",2016-05-17T17:00:50Z,2016-09-30T17:00:55Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']","['Business', 'Technology', 'Environment']",630,654,278,237,"This question was closed on ""No,"" with an end date of 30 September 2016. Kraftfahrt-Bundqesamt, the source for the best-selling-cars report mentioned below, reported 3,321 new battery electric vehicles were registered in the third quarter (Kraftfahrt-Bundqesamt). Germany is launching a 1 billion euro rebate scheme to incentivize the sale of electric vehicles (Reuters). Question will be resolved using the totals from the ""Electric"" columns for the three months in Q3, July, August, and September at best-selling-cars.com. Registrations of hybrid electric vehicles and plug-in-vehicles will not count. Third quarter registrations in 2015 were 2,722, and include both German (e.g. BMW i3; VW e-Golf) and non-German (e.g. Nissan Leaf; Tesla Model X) models. Question will be suspended on 30 September 2016 and resolved when September's data is released. The new subsidy program, which gives purchasers a discount of 3000-4000 euros for select vehicles, is scheduled to start as early as May 2016. The German government is perceived as wanting to support the German auto companies, which are very important to the German economy, and to draw attention away from the diesel engine scandal of Volkswagen by emphasizing the country’s commitment to “green” technologies. The tax is controversial with some economists, who oppose subsidizing private purchases, and with environmentalists, who see negative impact from a boost in electricity consumption at a time when Germany’s ban on nuclear power plants has made its electricity generation more coal-based.

This varied by model. In the Netherlands the incentive structure is a bit more complicated but ""In total for 2015, plug-in vehicle reached 43,300 units, +183% over 2014"" http://cleantechnica.com/2016/03/07/ev-sales-22-of-car-sales-in-netherlands-in-december-2015/ Initial crude calculations that 6000 euro incentive would mean a possible 12 to 60% within a year in the US and 184% in NL. So 185% is a long shot but possible. There a few specific German factors: - this looks like it comes off the tag price of the car so it is likely to have more of an effect than tax credit. - new models from German manufacturers are coming on stream, the US example shows models have an effect on sales - Range anxiety is less of an issue that in the US due to higher population density - Germans aren't like the Dutch on cars - the land of BMW 7 series and no speed limits on many motorways won't be crazy for EV"

I can only speculate that consumers anticipated this incentive being announced so there is some pent up demand so this is a + -timing- incentive program starts in May and is first come first serve up to 400K cars in total which should last a few years but may have some impact on pulling in demand so slight + - the May partial month EV registrations will give us an idea of the trajectory but the June full month number will give us clarity - 1200 is a good number for June IMO to get to 6K in 3Q16"

(Some additional incentives such as free parking and no tolls were being offered.) The population of Norway is only 5 million compared to Germany's 80 million. Germany is already selling around 2700 all- electrics per month. Even though Norway is rather richer than Germany I'd expect that the famously green Germans ought to at least buy all-electric cars at a third of the Norwegian rate. That would mean sales of slightly over 6000 cars per month. (1200*1/3*80/5).

It would be, in case a battery had the size and weight of a book , clean, integrated in the dash board, standardized and emtpy ones could be exchanged at any filling station against a loaded one - against a fair fee. Today, small battery cars are rather used as second cars or city cars or for citizens with their job in a 10 mile distance (or retired ones).

German total auto sales for 2015 grew approximately 4% YOY with no particular incentives and VW under the radar which may have suppressed a normalized growth cycle. Assuming auto sales in Germany grow @10% per year then BEV growth of 100%+ appears aggressively speculative. Starting with a conservative estimate, following monthly sales trends with latest incentive packages that can change my judgement"

Average income is about 3500 euro a month. They have wind mills all over the place that I think are mostly for show. Car Registrations in 3rd Q in Germany is expected to be 261493 compared to 1st Q 315921 (actual) and 2 Q 282228. A 4 thousand euro discount from the German Gov for an EV car is good but its all the other stuff that is complicated. Germany also has a fairly efficient public transit system! There are only 2638 EV charging stations. It makes more sense to buy a hybrid versus just EV I'm going to come in low at 33% and wait for the official 2Q registration numbers. https://ev-charging.com/at/en/catalog/index/de/0. http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/car-registrations/forecast
