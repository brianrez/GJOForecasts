The confirmation hearing for Ms Barrett, a conservative appeals-court judge, will be the first for a SCOTUS seat to be held partially by video-conference. At least two Republican committee members have tested positive for covid-19 and will participate virtually. Over the coming days senators will probe Ms Barrett’s views on matters including health care and abortion, and may press her to explain whether a letter she signed urging “the unborn to be protected in law” means she would jettison Roe v Wade . If, as expected, Ms Barrett gets the committee’s nod, a full Senate vote will follow in late October. Mr Trump hopes to seat his nominee before the election, but infected Republicans might complicate this plan. Senate rules require this tally to take place in person.“"

A re-hearing would be consistent with the Court’s practice in several close cases in 2016 after the death of Justice Scalia left the Court with eight members for about a year."

The larger question now is the timing of the nomination. It appears that the Republican caucus is prepared to move rapidly with her nomination. She has already visited 19 Republican Senators in her first two days of hill meetings (a tradition among nominees is to offer a meeting to every sitting Senator). Although Democrats are still deciding on their tactics for how to handle the situation, they do not hold any silver bullet to stop the train and few options to slow it down. With the books cleared of other legislative issues (other than coronavirus relief), it would appear we are on track for mid-Oct hearings. This would likely set up a floor vote in mid-to-late October. Given the possibility of election court challenges, this would seem to increase the likelihood of a quick nomination. The only possibility for a lame-duck confirmation would likely be from Senators on the ballot in 2020 with close races.

There is a possibility that it could be held up by a shock event or delay in voting. This event would likely not be enough to not confirm her. If held past the election they would still try to appoint but a compromise could cause the GOP to have reason to delay the compromise. My 89% is based mostly off the messaging of the current intent and that the votes exisit to to it. It would also pay for repblicans to have a stable SCOTUS prior to the election and this gives me confidence.

Eventual confirmation is virtually assured. Media report that the Republican leadership in the Senate intends to move quickly with an eye toward a full Senate confirmation vote in late October. Given Barrett's recent (2017) confirmation for an appellate court seat, it seems unlikely significant new information will come to light that might sway at least two more Republican senators not to vote for her. However, it is possible depending on election polls in October, the Republican Senate leadership may seem some advantage in delaying the confirmation vote beyond the election. I think this is unlikely but possible."

The herd is probably right, and I won't go all in with a counter forecast. But Mitch McConnell may want to help a couple of the more moderate senators (Collins of Maine) in their reelection efforts. And while I doubt the Democrats can do much to stop McConnell if he decides to proceed quickly, something could happen. So I'll put the odds at 93%."
