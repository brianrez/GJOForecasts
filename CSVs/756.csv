While Arsenal have more to play for (this is their only shot as silverware) and Chelsea have the CL to look forward to, the lack of defensive prowess on both teams means goals are almost certain. The more goals are scored, the less likely a draw becomes, and with the variability of performances and disparity in talent between the teams, it seems less likely the game will ultimately end in a shootout."
