I didn't think this would happen because it doesn't make sense to reduce Raisi's long term legitimacy on what I perceived to be a long shot to get Raisi to win this, as it would deteriorate his ability to eventually go for supreme leader, but now that it's happened, I'm starting to consider the possibility that this might be because the establishment knows that Raisi's going to win, e.g., rigging the election. I still think that's unlikely in the broad scheme of things, because of what happened in 2009 when similar things were alleged, and the Arab Spring probably convinced hardliners that a big popular uprising isn't great even though the Iranians are probably better coup-proofed, but it still could happen. As such, I'm going to adjust up and down after adding Ghalibaf's former percentage to Raisi. This is very worrying. That being said, I still think that Rohani's going to take it. I don't see voter turnout dropping that much, nor do I see Raisi gaining all of the conservative faction. But this is still cause for worry."

Scattered reports suggest that the Rouhani's success depends on turnout, and that turnout is in danger. I think that's stretching it. [http://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/Iran%20Elections%20-%20web.pdf] If we look at last year's parliamentary elections, in which the moderates did quite well, turnout was 2% higher than normal. Also, in places like Tehran where turnout was roughly 50%, the Republicans (Iranian moderates) did extraordinarily well, winning every seat up for grabs. A couple things that could tip the scales: the Ayotollah coming in hard for a candidate. The candidate he's most likely to do so for, if he did, would be Ebrahim Raisi, as they reportedly are quite similar in viewpoints. But the issue here is that if Ebrahim Raisi lost anyways, which TBH is likely, even if Ghalibaf drops out and favors him, the Ayotollah would be embarassed, and because Raisi is reportedly his preferred successor, he would also de-legitimatize him. I think it's too risky. Another thing that might harm his chances is that if in the upcoming visit to Riyadh by Prez. Trump, something particularly hawkish is said/planned. If the relations are too antagonistic, this could push the electorate to the right. But especially because of the dangers of doing so, I think that Gen. McMaster and SecDef Mattis will be strongly cautioning against this. A strong statement against Iran could be intended to direct attention away from the Comey hubbub, but in the broad scheme of things, I doubt that anything too antagonistic will be said considering that Trump isn't really planning on doing any big speeches right now."

Looking at the previous election results (which is probably the best predictor of this one), Rohani wiped the floor with Ghalibaf. Ebrahim Raisi, aside from potentially being the favorite of the Ayotollah, doesn't have a whole lot of other things going for him. Look at the amount of people that don't know him in the poll [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_Iranian_presidential_election,_2017] The FA article suggests that Rohani has gotten an increasing amount of support across the political spectrum. He won handily in 2013, and especially with the huge leap in Iranian economic growth, and with the courting of conservative factions, I think it would take a miracle, or some shady business, for Ghalibaf to come close. This is a more cautious estimate than some of the others for a few reasons: I think that the Raisi camp is going to fold and go for Ghalibaf sometime soon. While Raisi is reportedly more favorable with the Supreme Leader, as mentioned earlier, nobody knows who he is. While I still think that Ghalibaf has meager chances, in part due to the fact that many Iranians surely associated recent successes with Rohani, that boost could be useful. I do not think, as some have suggested, that Ghalibaf will drop in favor of Raisi. He has been gaining steam lately, but I simply doubt he can gain enough steam to paint himself as a credible alternative to Ghalibaf within a few weeks. If that changes, I'll update. What worries me about my forecast (and I daresay personally worries me) is some kind of aggressive statement by the Trump administration could bolster support for hardliners. If it went poorly, it could very well boost Raisi's support enough to attract Ghalibaf's votes, and start to push more moderate conservatives to Raisi's side as well. I think the Administration knows this, so they will probably be careful, but a stray tweet could lead to a large percentage change in my estimates. That being said, I ultimately still see Rohani winning this. http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-22916174 Also, https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/05/03/who-will-rule-iran-tehrans-presidential-election-foreshadows-succession-politics/?utm_campaign=Foreign%20Policy&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=51590492 Ghalibaf is still the conservative candidate to beat. And as the article notes, it's simply too risky to try and do any kind of large scale rigging when Rohani's doing just fine."
