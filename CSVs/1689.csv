Chances of that number dipping below 30% feels slim, but I gave it a 5% chance since anything seems possible with this administration and the news stream associated with it. Maybe Trump will see a bump above 40 in light of: 1) His romantic weekend in Paris with Macron 2) The possibility of the US rejoining the Paris Climate Accord 3) Anomalies like his recent allowance of the Afghan Girls Robotics Team to visit the US to compete after being allegedly barred initially, and 4) Planning of more positive gestures for many Americans like the announcement of 'Made in America' week. It shows a possible yet microscopically slight softening of his more rigid tendencies. That said, these are minor factors in a much bigger picture, and they could easily be cancelled out with one unfortunate Tweet or off comment. I predict Trump will eventually dip below George W.

Starting with 100% in the 30-40 bracket (current position), what would nudge the poll up to 40-50 bracket? 1. The economy: even though it is improving at fast pace, it won't have enough time to change opinions. 2. His agenda: mostly pleasing his base and may convert some republicans/independents to his supporters column, but the two main items (repeal of Obamacare and tax reform) may not see the light before August 1 and even by then, won't sway opinions much. 3. His reaction toward external threat (such as 9/11 or invasion of Kuwait kind of magnitude): this may make unpopular president popular. But such event is rare and we won't have enough time to see it happen. 4. Statistical margin of error: +/-3% margin of error for Gallup polls. For example, if true approval rate were 38%, a poll may, by statistical fluke, read it as 41%, putting it in the 40% bracket."

Hence, it is unlikely that Trump will be able to beat those numbers since there haven't been many major changes in American politics since Clinton. (H. W. Bush also never picked up his approval numbers again during his exit.) H. Bush enjoyed high approval ratings mainly because of his response to the 9/11 attacks. For Trump to have such a high approval rating, there would need to be a major event like 9/11. But 9/11 was completely unprecedented in American history because of the enormous scale of the attack on civilian lives. Even with the rise of ISIS, it is unlikely that a similar attack will occur because of increased American security since 9/11. Perhaps there might a crisis with North Korea that might lead to a spike in Trump's approval ratings. However, Kim Jong Un hasn't done anything spectacularly different since his inception. Kim Jon Un's actions have been roughly the same as his actions when Obama was in office. Thus, the two major international issues that might increase Trump's approval rating are unlikely to occur. The only other possibility that might increase Trump's approval rating is the economy. Although the economy did fairly well under Clinton, Clinton still did not spend much time with above 60% ratings during his presidency. That only happened in the last two years of his presidency, not the last two years. Furthermore, this requires that Trump's economic policies will have a positive effect on the economy. But given that a lot of the disgruntlement about the economy from the working middle class (the base of Trump's supporters) is about the lack of jobs, it is unlikely that Trump's current policies will change much. For the past 20 years, a lot of American manufacturing jobs have been lost to automation and other technological advances. These advances will continue to happen and they will continue to disrupt traditional American jobs. Even with Obama's stimulus packages delivered right to those middle-class workers, Obama did not spend much time with approval ratings greater than 60%. Finally, and most importantly, presidents since Clinton (w/ exception of H. Bush during 9/11) have had quite steady approval ratings. Since his approval ratings is at around low 40's and high 30's according to five-thirty, it is likely that the numbers will stay there, with some downward trajectory. For all the reasons, I have listed, it is unlikely for Trump's approval ratings to go up. Although they may go down, they would only go down with a scandal like Watergate. In all the Gallup polls, American presidents have had approval ratings above 30%. Carter, for all his flaws, only spent a brief period of time below 30%. Even then, his low ratings were at the end of his presidency, not the beginning. Nixon was the only president in American history to resign. For Trump to follow in that footsteps, he would have to have a scandal on the magnitude of Watergate. Even then, Watergate took almost 2 years to play out. Other scandals like the Iran-Contra scandal and Clinton's Lewinsky scandal also did not do much to presidents' approval ratings. While there is a probability of things going badly for Trump, especially with Comey's upcoming testimony, that probability is low."

That only happened in the last two years of his presidency, not the last two years. Furthermore, this requires that Trump's economic policies will have a positive effect on the economy. But given that a lot of the disgruntlement about the economy from the working middle class (the base of Trump's supporters) is about the lack of jobs, it is unlikely that Trump's current policies will change much. For the past 20 years, a lot of American manufacturing jobs have been lost to automation and other technological advances. These advances will continue to happen and they will continue to disrupt traditional American jobs. Even with Obama's stimulus packages delivered right to those middle-class workers, Obama did not spend much time with approval ratings greater than 60%. Finally, and most importantly, presidents since Clinton (w/ exception of H. Bush during 9/11) have had quite steady approval ratings. For all the reasons, I have listed, it is unlikely for Trump's approval ratings to go up. Although they may go down, they would only go down with a scandal like Watergate. In all the Gallup polls, American presidents have had approval ratings above 30%. Carter, for all his flaws, only spent a brief period of time below 30%. Even then, his low ratings were at the end of his presidency, not the beginning. Nixon was the only president in American history to resign. For Trump to follow in that footsteps, he would have to have a scandal on the magnitude of Watergate. Even then, Watergate took almost 2 years to play out. Other scandals like the Iran-Contra scandal and Clinton's Lewinsky scandal also did not do much to presidents' approval ratings. While there is a probability of things going badly for Trump, especially with Comey's upcoming testimony, that probability is low."

Fifty-four percent of voters say Trump is abusing the powers of his office, according to the latest survey by Quinnipiac. Only 37 percent approve of his job performance, about the same as the 36 percent who approved two weeks ago. Fifty-nine percent say Trump is dishonest. Sixty-six percent support the appointment of a special counsel to investigate possible improper links between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia. Trump opposed that investigation, but the Justice Department named former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel anyway. ""President Donald Trump remains mired in dreadful mid-30s approval numbers and the red flags that are popping up tell an even darker story,"" Tim Malloy, the poll's assistant director, told reporters.

Intuitively I find something similar to this to be the most likely - Trump is already down close to his core support group for these approval ratings, and it would be hard to definitively shake tons of support from them OR for him to make a large turnaround. However, polls thus far haven't really captured potential fallout from the Comey/Flynn revelations of the past week so things may go further underwater for him soon."

There is a possibility of the Comey firing triggering a slew of leaks and testimony that leads to concrete information and/or actions by congress or the justice department but, barring that, it's hard to see his numbers moving significantly in the short term. If his numbers do sink below 30% they could collapse completely in an ""emperor's clothes"" scenario. He's very unlikely to recover much from this current figures and move beyond 40%.

I was at first estimating the drop was going to be around 2.4%, and then I changed my estimation to about a 6.4% drop, taking into account the fact that President Obama dropped about 13% over the time frame, and now that I looked at it, that was the closest analogue. Now that this has happened, and if I adjust for another 3% down, we're looking at the final approval rating being roughly around 36-35%. Some other things that could change: -The AHCA becomes law. I'm actually pessimistic about this, because if you look at the day the AHCA passed the house, approval ratings actually dropped by 2%. As such, if this becomes law, I'm looking at roughly another 3% drop. -Something big happens in the investigation with Russia. I don't think this is going to happen, but if something does happen, I'm thinking it'll be at least 5%, maybe 10%.

As best as I could calculate (there was some guesstimation because numbers didnt' neatly line up), it is a drop of -2.44% from the inauguration. Some issues I still have to work on: the standard deviation on this is really high. As such, in a little bit, I'm going to redo my estimates based on two metrics: a) nearest neighbor, where i'll roughly guess the closest historical analogue for which I have poll data based on what we've seen so far, and then b) which is an events based model, in which I'll figure out what causes the polls to change broadly, and then I'll edit more particularly later. If anything significant happens (big law signed, Russia investigations go poorly, etc.) I'll modify up or down based on the data I get from (b). As mentioned, this is my first forecast, so I have no idea what I'm doing. Any constructive criticism will be appreciated."
