Reasons: - Hofer has consistently polled slightly ahead of Van der Bellen however as mentioned related to the recent US election, polls may be underestimating support for Hofer due to the ""far-right"" media reports and unwillingness of supporters to be insulted/labelled. - Key issues include immigration (1): Hofer wants to ban economic migrants, while Van Bellen calls for faster integration. A recent report of ""sharia police"" (2) in Germany suggests integration may be more difficult than Van Bellen suggests. CLIP: "" What are the key issues? Hofer has focussed on the EU’s migration crisis and called for a ban on economic migrants. Austria – a nation of 8.7 million – has taken in more than 120,000 migrants from the Middle East, Africa and Asia since last year, bearing much of the burden of the influx together with Germany and Sweden.

Giving a slight lead to Hofer now given Europe's rightward anti-migrant shift. Also, escalating tensions between Austria and Hungary over migrants might give Hofer an edge by keeping the migrant issue salient. Of course, if Trump loses in the US elections, there might be a backlash against populist candidates in later elections (read in Austria). So, very high level of uncertainty ATM, but going to keep an eye on this one."

Polls reported at the end of August had also Hofer in the lead [3] & [4], where it was also mentioned that the undecided were high, but a percentage was not given. Under these conditions, a prediction is particularly hard. The odds appear practically even (accounting for the polls margin of error). Moreover, there is at least two months before the election, with a large number of voters who have not decided, and a significant contributing factor on what to vote for many would be emotional. This means that the result can go either way depending on the candidates' PR tactics and events that happen to take place in the mean time (ranging from the plight of migrants to terrorist attacks), which will affect how many voters will be engaged to go to the ballot box in the first place and then also influence which candidate they will vote. Hence, at this point in time, an equal probability was assigned."
