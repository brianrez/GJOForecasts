Second, the UAE is being proactive with their vaccination roll-out and have administered over 19 million doses which translates to 93.9% of the population receiving at least one dose, and 83% of the population being fully vaccinated [2]. Additionally, the daily rates for infections and deaths have been steadily declining and are 17% off from the previous peak[3].
