From the Economist “Apple will at last reveal its new iPhone models today. As always, the firm has kept tight-lipped about the devices’ stand-out features (other than naming the launch event “Hi, Speed”). Many expect them to be able to connect to 5G networks, the zippy next generation of mobile technology. This, analysts predict, will trigger a new iPhone “supercycle”, with sales growing at rates in the double digits. Such predictions have helped Apple’s share price to surge by nearly 60% this year, driving its market capitalisation above $2trn. Yet more cautious voices say that the moment is not yet ripe. Super-fast 5G networks are not yet widespread, least of all in America, and consumers tend to hold on to their devices longer nowadays. In the midst of a pandemic many lack the cash for a new iSomething. But if the tech titan has timed the release correctly, it will be a sweet Apple-picking season.“"

Majority of increases in markets arise mostly from 5 stocks, among which is Apple. Market cycles also suggest profit taking prior to year's end, so Apple may hit $2T briefly before profit harvesting kicks in. Robinhood has benefitted from people at home with nothing to do which will diminish as normalcy returns; reducing purely speculative buys of Apple stock, which is way out of whack WRT P/E .

First, it is only a few hundred billion dollars more valuable than ARAMCO. While this may seem like a lot, AAPL can and often does shed a hundred billion dollars in market cap on a single bad trading day. I also see serious risk of AAPL dropping in value by more than 10% in the next few months because 1) The US economy will continue to be hit by the pandemic. 2) AAPL is currently trading at an extremely high P/E relative to historical prices, which combined with the bad economy could see a drop. AAPL's largest domestic competitor, AMZN, continues to gain market cap, and although it sees many of the problems I outline for AAPL above, it appears to be more robust to a bad economy. AMZN could pass AAPL as it gains market share as more local businesses shut down, and if AAPL drops in value due to a broad market selloff. Regarding ARAMCO, I know very little. I'm assigned a 15% chance of ARAMCO passing AAPL since I think ARAMCO is already hit with low oil prices that could be reversed and will not face a broad market sell of risk that high-priced US companies like AAPL may face."

If the WH administration (current and next) pursue the current path eroding US supply chains in mainland China, Apple may at a certain point in time, with demand increasing or at least stable, simply be cut off of supply. With some Apple business meanwhile ""immaterial"" (TV, streaming, App store, ...), there is still a risk of turnover being cut by at least 50% for a quarter. The valuation of Apple may shrink by 30% or more on an incident like this. Others of the US FAANG stocks are more resilient to US-China trade relations, such as amazon, which could easily overtake Apple's valuation. However, this scenario has a probability of ~10%, i'd say, but if it materializes, it will be devastating to AAPL."
