The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy disclosed its stance on Wednesday following a meeting with local manufacturers of solar cell panels to discuss the possible U.S. protectionist trade action against the products. The ministry said, however, it will first try to dissuade the U.S. from implementing safeguard actions on the South Korean products, adding it will submit its opinions to the U.S. Trade Representative later this month. The ministry said it will consider the possibility of taking the case to the WTO after it reviews a detailed report from the U.S. International Trade Commission(ITC) on the issue. On Tuesday, the ITC decided to recommend President Donald Trump to apply tariffs of up to 35 percent on solar cell and panel imports from South Korea and China. _____________________________ COMMENT: These news are from November.
