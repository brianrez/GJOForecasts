I think he's defined the Rs in ways that make it impossible for them to emerge from his shadow without at least giving him a shot at redemption. And in 2023-24, Biden wouldn't have much of an agenda to achieve and Ds may drop off in turnout so Trump would have a credible path. If he ran, there's nobody who could stand in his way.

What really matters is who is more motivated to turn up and vote. I see a clean sweep for Ds.

Although there hasn't been much movement in the polls, I believe that President Trump stands an improved chance to get the electoral votes through the following pathway where the polls are tighter and the ""shy voters - if that is a reality"" may be enough to carry it through. He has to carry all his dominant red states to include a tight TX. He also has to carry FL, OH, NC, and IA. If he also picks up AZ and GA and brings home some votes in Nebraska and some from Maine, he would then need PA, WI, MN, MI, or NV - all still tough. So a lot still has to go right for President Trump to pull this out, but I believe the probability is better than what is advertised currently.

While many are hesitant to believe the statistical models given the 2016 outcome, there is one notable difference this time: 2016 contained a higher percentage of undecided voters in the polls leading up to election day, putting Clinton under 46.0% in all but one of the ten closest states (that fact was aided by Johnson's presence, but that doesn't change the fact that the undecided percentage was higher at this point in 2016, and Johnson ended up getting only 3.4% on avg in these ten states vs. his avg polling of 5.6%, meaning Johnson was likely an effective ""undecided"" vote at that time for many of these). Biden, on the other hand, has above 46% in ten of ten close states as of seven days prior to election day, has near/above 49% in six of ten, and needs only four of those ten to win the election (ignoring special electoral districts, but similar story). Also, with Biden currently leading in the polls in most close states, mail-in voting and early voting are already well underway. It looks like voter participation will be greater this year, a factor that has historically favored democrats, partly because the increase tends to skew toward younger, often more Democratic, voters."

At this same date in 2016 the polling averages gave Clinton a 5-point led over Trump and Clinton would ultimately go on to lose the election.1 While Democrats have been putting forth a strong showing in early/mail-in voting I do not think this significantly weighs on the side of a Biden victory given Republican mistrust for these voting methods.2 At present I simply do not believe Biden holds a commanding enough lead to indicate that he will be able to beat Trump in this upcoming election.

Many factors that helped Trump in 2016 are not active anymore (outsider status, Dems/media underestimating his chances, unpopular Dem candidate) and historically, incumbent presidents have fared worse in years of national crisis. Additionally, the chance of polls being off should be lower than in 2016 as polling firms have likely made adjustments to account for sampling bias and ""shy Trump voters"". My probability for the Dem win is only at 60 (vs. ~ 63% on betting markets), because there is some chance of polls tightening very quickly, as they did in 2016."

President Trump is even behind in most battleground states. His current approval ratings are closer to that of President Bush and Carter, average of 40%, with only three weeks to go. Presidents Bush and Carter were dealing with crisis as well as election day drew near. However, I am bringing my percentage back to 1 in 4 for two reasons. Trump could still win the electoral college as the polls are closer there. Also, even though COVID has ravaged the economy, some economic improvement leading up to election day may inspire greater confidence in voters for the President to lead through and post-COVID. I was considering a bump for his approval ratings after his COVID fight, like it has for other world leaders, but his approval numbers didn't fluctuate substantially with COVID and impeachment."

Without any clear winner, the debate did not seem to make any difference for polls on either side.

As of September 12, 2020, registered voters point toward a 53 to 45 percent spit between Biden and Trump. While this is a significant lead, other factors must be taken into account. 66% of Trump supporters say they support him strongly, while just 46% of Biden supporters say the same. 5% of Biden supporters, 4% of Trump voters state that there is a chance they change their mind, while 84% of Biden supporters and 85% of Trump voters say they are certain of their vote. Trump draws support from 53% of those with a high school diploma or less versus Biden with 89% of the black vote. Of all Trump voters from 2016, 94% say they will vote for Trump again this November; about 5% say they will support Biden. The pattern is the same as Clinton supporters will vote for Biden at the same rate. Research also suggests that voters are highly engaged, but nearly half expect to have difficulties voting. Another factor that has emerged to support a Biden victory is the new cohort of voters who have registered since 2016. In 2018’s midterm, nearly 120 million people voted, about 35 million more than in the previous midterm, in 2014, with 51 percent of eligible voters participating. This figure is believed to be 14 million new voters that were not voting in 2016. These new voters have also been primary democrat, pushing a 60/40 split. The Economist utilized analyzing polling and economic and demographic data to predict America’s elections in 2020. This algorithm currently has Biden with 336 electoral votes while Trump trails with 202. This model works by simulating 20,000 paths for the election, each time varying candidates’ vote shares to account for polling error, changes in turnout or the political environment, and the effects of campaigning. As of 25 September, the election has already seen 28 million ballots requested and another 43 million set to automatically be mailed. Democrats have accounted for over 1.3 million more of these pre-votes than republicans. BLM and the resulting call for social justice will also play a major part in the election as many of these new voters will be attracted by this rallying cry. On the other hand, It’s not just the BLM movement affected as every time there is civil unrest it attracts people from the right. This presidential election could be decided by the amount of violence in the street. Not just from the police and protesters, but right and left-wing groups that bring violence to the table as well. It’s going to be very difficult for the Trump administration to use the current status quo as a platform to win votes. Therefore, the factors and analytics suggest a minor victor for Biden in the 2020 election.

I am not a big fan of national polls, however the last polls indicate Biden is holding a lead but many states still have not taken polls. I believe President Trump still has the potential to win this election, but it will be close. Trump needed a good showing during the first debate (or a poor showing by Biden) and he did not appear to deliver. I consider the debate a tie at best, which will hurt Trump and he did not see a closing of the gap. However, that happened during his first debate in 2016 and he came back with strong debates later. The one downside, he doesn't have many more opportunities now to change where the polls are and Biden's lead is steady if not growing, even with a Republican Electoral College advantage. The other impact will be mail-in voting that has already begun. One other factor I do consider is voter enthusiasm. I gauge this by numbers of yard signs, flags, banners, etc. During a recent cross country trip last week the number of Trump flags, bumper stickers and signs were significantly greater then Biden. In fact, I was surprised how few Biden signs are in California, and only one in Oklahoma. There were Trump flags and signs all across the country in 6 states (TN, OK, AR, TX NM, and AZ) we crossed, until we arrived in Cali. I was making an effort to notice any political sigs and in some states like Oklahoma, Texas and Arkansas there were, what I would call, Trump shrines. These shrines had numerous (i.e. over 10 flags) and banners surrounding a large billboard. I did look and only saw ONE Biden billboard in Arizona and no flags banners etc, until we arrived in California. I know this is not scientific, but I was surprised and not expecting to see some much Trump support across the lower southern states along Interstate- 40 and 10."

As for another candidate, third-party candidates have not won a significant percentage of the vote in a presidential election in recent memory.

From the Economist: “Don’t waste time chasing swing voters, say many political consultants. Instead, focus on turning out your supporters. Mobilisation, not persuasion, wins campaigns in a deeply polarised America. There is some sense to this. Mr Trump’s approval rating stayed above 40% through impeachment, the disastrous federal response to covid-19 and months of street protests. And even on inauguration day it had never cleared 50%. But although most voters have already made up their minds, a few haven’t—around 3%, according to a pair of recent polls. This sliver of the electorate could prove decisive, and Donald Trump knows it. Tonight he takes live questions from undecided voters at a town hall in Philadelphia—the biggest city in Pennsylvania, among the most important swing states (ABC, the network broadcasting the event, has offered to hold one for Joe Biden too). In 2016, late-deciding voters backed Mr Trump; he may need them again to win another term.“"

In 2016, polls failed to capture a substantial number of quiet Trump supporters in swing states, and its possible, even likely, that could happen again in 2020.

Again, this is more along the lines of listening to the wisdom of crowds, versus personal instinct."

He has closed the gap in most swing states to within a few percentage points and while more states are 50/50 toss-ups than in 2016 it is still possible for Trump, as an incumbent now adopting a populist message, to pull this one out. The country is very divided and Trump has clearly found his floor while Biden has plateaued at this apparent ceiling leading into November. The GOP continue to hammer Biden and Democrats with coherent campaigns and appear fairly consistent in their overall messaging while Dems are still struggling to find any solid footing outside of unity and a return to normalcy, both of which are nice but do not speak to specific issues voters are worried about. Polling shows people are starting to lose interest in the pandemic as well as turn against the Black Lives Matter movement, both of which are likely consequences of both attention fatigue and coordinated efforts by right-wing media to cast both in a partisan light. Despite all of this, Biden continues to poll ahead overall and I still believe he would win if voting occurred today. With 2 months left, however, I am far from confident in either candidates' ability to win the presidency by a significant margin."

There was some controversy with last year’s model because it failed to predict Trump’s win. I don’t think that should detract from the fact that the FiveThirtyEight models really are the gold standard. As they point out, their models gave Trump a considerably higher chance of winning than other models (2x in the case of the New York Times). So, yes they were ‘wrong’ last time but they also outperformed the crowd by a large margin - something we know a lot about here at the Good Judgement Project. From what I have read, the model does a good job of bringing in information from a number of different approaches to election modelling including polls, economic data, the COVID factor, ease of voting and seems to treat each with a sober assessment of its limits.

They also miscalculated how close to the center that base would have to be to maximize the base size * base turnout math. The Democrats were also surprised that once in power, the Trump administration did not pivot to the center but instead attempted to solidify the base and create a loyalty cult. And chances are that this would have succeeded had the left stayed frustrated, sidelined and reactive to all the trolling and false-crises thrown out to distract (as in both entertain and pull attention away). But sometimes reality throws out actual crises. And Covid was it. By continuing to rile up the base, the Administration committed the error of effectively 'wishing death' on blue states, cities and their higher at risk populations. They flirted with the rhetoric of life and death, and the left believed them, triggering a phases shift in psychology to an existential frame (better crash the plane then have Hillary win - better burn down cities than submit to slow-motion genocide.) This hyper bi-modal electorate will now play the game of who can energize a higher turnout. The young and blue-collar workers that didn't turn out after Bernie was sidelined last time and people of color who couldn't get excited about Hillary will show up now. Because since the Republicans were going to villainize and highlight extremism on the left, the left said fine, let's be what they say we are; we'll at least have as much fun as they're having in their MAGA hats...tribalism feeds tribal responses. Putin's will be happy with the long term damage this will do, but Trump doesn't get to foment another four years of chaos."

However, Trump irresponsibly appeals to very dangerous ideologies and makes very shallow attempts to dispute those affiliations. Many people who support him will find any negative press as a slam piece meant to destroy his presidency, which is quite disturbing. But some are waking up to the dangers of nationalism--it is not the same as patriotism, and as time wears on, more and more people will lose the favor of the dominant party. We are seeing the canary in the coalmine, when protesters exercising their rights are being misrepresented as criminals by a grandstanding president. And his crowd of supporters just eat it up. Current events in racial justice as well as the pandemic will spur latent voters to action, and it will hopefully be enough to change the tide."

So let me begin, by stating what we do know with some caveats and then we can wade into the unknowns. a) Health of the economy matters and is positively correlated to the chances of the reelection. In this case, it should negatively impact Trump's chances with the caveat around the driver for the anticipated recession. Can Trump persuade the voters that this was wholly China's fault and he will compensate by being tough on them? b) Trump's approval rating stayed roughly the same ~ 42% over nearly 4 years. That suggests,- he can count on his base + a random component, but there is also ceiling on his support. Which is very unlikely to increase, given the health crisis + recession. c) Related to above point, Trump was greatly helped in 2016 by facing a very unpopular candidate- which is certainly not the case in 2020. Biden seems way more popular and the efforts of the establishment to bring the party together should increase the odds for the Democratic party."

And of course the incumbent has historically held an advantage - 14 of the last 19 U.S. presidents seeking reelection won. Trump's base remains loyal, however Trump's re-election campaign has been built on the strength of the economy. With stock losses of 30 percent and rising unemployment claims, this turns Trump's campaign on its head. US troops remain in Afghanistan and Iraq despite Trump's 2016 campaign pledges to end those wars. Trump's handling of the COVID-19 virus has also opened him to criticism from all sides. In addition, the likely victory of centrist candidate Joe Biden over far-left Bernie Sanders works in the Democratic Party's favor. For these reasons, the Democratic party has the edge in the 2020 presidential election. https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/02/2020-president-trump-reelection-chances-looking-better-and-better/"

For example in the key battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania Trump won by 0.23%, 0.72% and 0.73%. All these states have experienced a swing of between 5-20% in favour of the democrats in the 2018 midterms despite the booming economy suggesting voter's do not credit Trump with the positive economic outcome. In addition, the most likely Democratic nominee, Bernie Sanders, polls consistently above Trump in these states as do other potential candidates suggesting the Democrats will probably win back these states barring an aberration. As well as this, other states the Republicans could lose include North Carolina, Florida and Ohio, potentially even Arizona, Iowa, Georgia and perhaps even Texas in an unusual election wave. This weakness in a large number of states gives the Democrats a large number of likely paths to victory. In contrast, the Democrats have few seats they are potentially weak in (due to only winning in 2016 by less than 5%), namely Nevada, Colorado, New Hampshire, Maine and Wisconsin. However, Democrats, especially Sanders poll far better than Trump in these states suggesting the chances of them being lost is quite slim. In conclusion, Trump support seems to have hit an early ceiling providing little room for growth over 2016. However, the Democrats possess large room for growth and the vast majority swing-states going into the 2020 election are currently Republican-held. In light of the current Blue Wave, it seems unlikely the Republican's will be able to hold enough states to retain the Presidency in the face of an energised Democrat vote and a potential candidate that appeals to the Rust Belt vote that catapulted Trump to the Presidency."

Historically, the incumbent President seeking a second term is likely to win (roughly 80% of all elections historically). Trump's approval rating and current polling are also broadly consistent with incumbent presidents at this stage in an election cycle - his approval rating is consistent with Obama's in 2012 and his polling, while lower than some of the Democratic challengers, would likely increase during the election. Of the Democratic candidates only Biden and Bloomberg's polling suggests a decent chance of victory against Trump and even these candidates' polling against Trump is not notably high historically compared to challengers who have beaten incumbents.

He has done nothing serious to expand his base and is counting on near-perfect turnout in groups that like him, such as white Evangelicals, white males, non-college rural and smaller subsets such as Latino-Cuban voters in states like Florida. He has turned off most minorities, women (especially suburban), college-educated (including many white males), and urban voters. He does not even have a majority of Jewish voters supporting him, even further alienating this block of voters. Impeachment I think will be a net neutral unless something incredibly bad comes out and the Republican-controlled Senate is seen to put on blinders and it can be distilled into a simple campaign ad. I also think Trump is very vulnerable to healthcare, especially since his Justice Dept. is still trying to overturn the ACA including pre-existing conditions that are currently more popular than Trump. Trump is so worried about this that he is seeking to push it in the Supreme Court until next term to avoid the campaign issue. Trump also has Billionaire Michael Bloomberg who is willing to spend almost limitless money to defeat him even if he is not the final Democratic nominee. Trump has things going for him also. The voter suppression by many Republican Attorney General's is potentially going to harm the Democrats. The Democrat's may put a candidate that appears to far left and be an easy target for misleading ads about socialism. Also, Trump's base, though a minority, is very passionate and dependable voters. The Democrats will have to surpass that intensity of turnout. Trump also has low unemployment and a high stock market to boast about, usally out of context."

I realize some disconnect in wider base between health of economy and incumbent reelection (economy and voting intent used to be far stronger ) but will bolster the already strong Trump voters. Even if economy falters a bit, they will count on him. If Dem nominee can provide a convincing message, get out the vote, and swing a few people who vote Trump but don’t like it, they stand a chance. The “safe” candidate (Biden) may not offer enough change for some who seek disruption (Warren or Sanders)...but that could reduce any crossover voting. Current forecast is heavily pro-Trump."

The Dems seem divided between the moderates and the hard left and unable to form a coalition. Biden is the best hope for the Democratic Party as it stands, because he is very popular with the minorities and probably see as an extension of the Obama era. His running mate will need to pull in the hard left. The best candidate (probably the most obvious) is Harris. It would make for a good campaign between incumbent and challenger. The incumbent historically has greater chances of re-election especially with a roaring economy. A positive outcome of the trade deal with China will solidify Trump's hold of the electorate."
