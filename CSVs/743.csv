Facts: - 2nd one cancelled, almost no chance for that to be repeated, as none of the candidates seems to be interested (=not bin 4 !) - it´s a tradition to have those debates. It´s important. Everybody would see, that it would only be for some tactical reasons, if not at least another debate would take place (only 1 out of 3 traditional ones would be ridiculous in my mind), and both candidates agreed to do it already. So far I´m 100% in bin 3. Now it starts to get complicated. As an outsider I´ve got no chance to really understand the current mood in the US. No chance to see, which source still is more or less reliable. They are so polar: believe X or not, believe Y or not. Nothing inbetween. In my country you can read ""Spiegel"" and ""Focus"" and an aggregation of those will be quite close to the truth. How to aggregate black and white like in the US?"

Hard to predict whether the October 22nd debate happens but what else can Trump do to shake things up? As President, he has more power to shake things up besides doing more debates with Biden.

As such, I will just give the basic gist of it - considering age, rapidity and suspected extent of symptom onset, and existing risk factors a certain relatively high risk of not recovering exits. Adding some additional factors such as rapid access to high-level treatments and care likely decreases this risk some. There is a larger possibility of recovery but it could be a long one lasting weeks to months. Since there is a strong desire to have public visibility during final weeks before a contentious election, I feel there is a much higher chance of having 2 debates but a much smaller one of having all three. So many high level individuals in government and RNC have been exposed in close quarters without masks, and the count of those infected is rising extremely rapidly. It takes 2 weeks to allow all of those exposed the time to develop symptoms. What about others who carry out essential daily functions at the WH? The hundreds of people who attended the rose garden event? Everyone exposed at the events between Saturday and Thursday? All of their families? This could be much more than a small ripple - it could be a tsunami. The remaining debates would most certainly shift the focus back to the pandemic, which is what the RNC has been trying to avoid from the onset."

Trump came off looking terrible and Biden at times struggled to get a single word in between Trump's interruptions and Wallace's pivots. That fact alone leads me to think we won't make it to a third debate since neither camp really benefits from the clown show that the nation just witnessed. However, and much more importantly in my mind, that was the FOX News debate. Trump will not have an easier time in any of the other two, especially now that other moderators will (hopefully) prepare for his interruptions by prepping tactics like cutting his mic when Biden is speaking. The questions won't get better for him, the framing will be less favorable, and the follow-ups will likely be more aggressive than what we just saw. Knowing Trump, if the second debate does not go his way he is incredibly likely to take his ball and go home, choosing to call the media and moderators biased and hacks instead of debate Biden. Additionally, though related, I just cannot see the debates going better for him. If he talks less Biden is clearly better at speaking about policy and would steamroll him with ideas and his vision for America, but it is also obvious that not letting Biden speak at all did not do him any favors either. We have seen Trump cancel press briefings after he was embarrassed by his bleach remarks before and if he sees his polling drop after either of the first 2 debates I find it unlikely he wouldn't just call it quits. I know I am in the minority here, but these are strange times and I cannot imagine either candidate allowing 2 more debates like that one to happen."

These all occurred either in late September or October, a period which is still over a month and a half away. So historically, it would seem 2-3 debates would be most likely, with 0-1 being virtually unheard of in modern political history. Biden has also committed to all three scheduled debates (he did so in June), further increasing the chances all three are held. However, there are several reasons that less than three debates would be held. First, there is the pandemic, which will change the possible optics of a debate and won't allow candidates to exude as much confidence/competence (picture Trump following Clinton around the stage versus Trump crouched over in front of a laptop). With candidates swapping jabs about cognitive ability and old age, such optics may lead to one or both sides excusing themselves from later debates. Similarly, Trump is currently finding as many ways as possible to get in front of cameras and speak to the American people. The debates would give him another avenue to do this. However, as we saw with his COVID task force briefings, he will forego the limelight if doing otherwise may tarnish his image (bleach, anyone?). So, if the first or second debate goes exceptionally poorly in one way or another (doubtful, but possible), we may not make it to the final debate(s)."
