93350,2021-10-01T06:02:06Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],"This case hinges upon the conservative bent of the court justices that makes up the Supreme Court. Trump appointed three conservative justices, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett that gives the conservatives a 6-3 advantage. Barrett, as a judge on a Chicago- based federal appeals court in 2019 wrote a dissenting opinion that ‘legislatures have the power to prohibit dangerous people from possessing guns, but that power extends only to people who are dangerous.’ This is perhaps an indication as to she may vote on this case. The opinion is that Barrett will join her fellow conservatives in extending the right to bear arms out of the home into the public sphere. Justice Brett Kavanaugh recommended ‘that the justices take up another Second Amendment case soon, suggesting the lower courts might not be properly applying the Supreme Court's earlier gun rights rulings. Kavanaugh, during his tenure on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, dissented from that court's gun rights ruling, which upheld a ban on military-style, semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines.’ A concealed carry weapon (CCW) is permitted in New York within your own property (Castle Doctrine), but this case is an attempt to allow it beyond these boundaries. Given the previous opinions of two of the conservative justices and the conservative majority (6-3) of the Supreme court, it is conceivable that they will agree that NY’s denial of concealed-carry licences violates the second amendment. Perhaps proof of a necessary self-defence requirement maybe a loophole."

This case, which they accepted after instructing the parties to ""brief a slightly narrower question than the challengers had asked them to decide, limiting the issue to whether the state’s denial of the individuals’ applications to carry a gun outside the home for self-defense violated the Second Amendment."" (Scotusblog) Casey says that states may impose some restrictions. Very tough call and Chief Justice Roberts will almost certainly be the swing vote."
