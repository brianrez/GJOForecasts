These ex-Baathists, with a talent for eye-catching violence and unsurpassed knowledge of the inner workings of Iraqi society, kept the Islamic State alive through lean years before leading it to sweeping victories following the American departure from Iraq.” “Almost all of the ex-Baathist leaders are dead, as are most of their immediate lieutenants. This represents a key difference between IS today and Al-Qaeda in 2011. When Osama Bin Laden died, many of his deputies were around to keep the organization running” “The Islamic State’s most obvious successors might seem to be it’s network of affiliates.

I read multiple questions and assumptions between the proposed question+ the more info section + answer options; so stripping them apart is my part 1. I’m all for collaborators to add to this list. Part II. will be the probabilities after I’ve had some time to research each factor laid-out here.

I suspect that the leader of IS (a nonstate actor) will continue to make significant strategic decisions regarding his own personal fate. Inter-organizational mechanisms that guarantee security would be held to an extremely small circle (I suspect). Organizational survival ranks higher among insurgents versus territorial expansion (despite its central ideological positioning) in states where they operate. Without exponential growth, IS will have significant strategic disadvantages for recruitment and other techniques which guarantee participation rates within its closed structures (military, ideological and religious domains within the organization."
