To gather the members you need 25 knesent members to raise a gathering offer to the chairman. As I see things here in Israel, Netanyahu will never resign without going to elections with a very high probability to win again. Due to our current military situation there is an unwritten law that will put aside political disputes. So, if I'm looking for a possibility to have a confidence lost (which is by means of gathering and vote turning towards it) there is a very little chance it will happen. If we look for elections call (by some reports it was for Jan/Feb not earlier) not a chance. Resignation? not Bibi."

I had been following the issue of whether the Knesset would pass legislation to lower the threshold for entering the Knesset because that was an obstacle for Netanyahu if he called early elections, he needed some of the smaller parties' support. The idea was that if elections were called early, those parties would vanish. Seems lowering the threshold doesn't work if minority parties unite and form one list so a new idea has been introduced to limit funding for ""lists"" to the top parties in the coalition. This is aimed straight at Arab representatives. https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/06/israel-likud-yoav-kisch-arab-knesset-members-joint-list-bill.html"

I have a number of Israelis in my social network and while not all of them approve of Netanyahu's leadership none of them seem to expect he will be out of power any time soon. Additionally I recall that during a recent election his party was projected to do poorly but in fact managed to gain several seats. Israeli relations with the US have never been better since the election of Trump and a number of Israelis (correctly or not) seem to be crediting Bibi for that. However the number of scandals and investigations facing him is large, so I don't think it is extremely unlikely that public opinion could change. I think it's very unlikely he will resign - from my knowledge that isn't typical of Israeli politicians and certainly not expected given Bibi's personality in particular. The other two possibilities are unlikely in my (admittedly poorly informed) opinion, but are much more plausible than resignation."

Israel has visa free travel regiment with Russia, 35% Israelis speak Russian, many have Russian citizenchip. Israel is celebrating the end of ww2 on May 9th, like Russia. The 9th May became a religeous memorial day like passover. Israelis know the history of the Holocaust, which was perpetrated by West, including USA, and know which army saved the Jewish nation - The Red Army. To those majority of US citizens, who live in an informational buble, I recommend two US books: Conjuring Hitler, how UK and America made the Third Reich; Nazinexus, by Edwin Black. Once you have read the books, you may ask your self who is directing the US education, media and how can this central agency control the informational industry from discussing this topics in the public. This will lead you to better understand how transparent, or not, the political system in USA is. In any case, Israel is a democratic country, which is also welcomed by the US administratiion, especially, since, giving the means available to US, it can easily manipulate a democratic system by supporting, or not, a given government, opposition. Therefore, whether Bibi will stay in his function is rather a question, whether Israel is ready to openly join the fascistic russophobia orchestrated by the failing empire USA. Israel won't join this hysteria, due to religeous, historical, demographic reasons, as weel as natioanl security interests. Bibi may fall, but a close relationship with Russia will stay. Russia, by the way, announced three weeks ago, that in case of an aggression from Iran against Israel, it will deffend Israel."

I also know that Liberal Israelis are not happy about the lobbying by conservatives American Jews who supported Trump to move the Embassy to Jerusalem which was facilitated by Jared Kushner who now has his own ethics issues. There is also political polarization in Israel over illegal immigration (especially Africans) who take low paying jobs especially in Eilat and other places that is similar to that in the US. All of this has made Netanyahu a lightening rod. There are four possible outcomes. Nothing happens. Resignation = 0. Lose a vote of confidence = 25. Call for new elections =15. Total = 40%."

He also has a variety of enemies that he can invoke to mobilize public opinion - not only the Palestinians, but the specter of a US pullout of the nuclear agreement with Iran, and the war in Syria.
