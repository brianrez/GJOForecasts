Will California extend the current restriction on urban water use before it expires on 29 February 2016?,2016-01-12T18:00:43Z,2016-02-02T22:00:35Z,Yes,"['Yes', 'No']","['Environment', 'US Policy']",734,654,512,237,"More than 90% of California is experiencing a 'severe drought' or worse (Drought Monitor). On 1 April 2015, Governor Jerry Brown imposed California's first mandatory water restrictions, requiring a 25% reduction in urban water use until the end of February 2016 (The Economist, CA Executive Order 1). On 13 November 2015, a further executive order ruled that if drought conditions persist beyond January 2016, water restrictions will be extended until 31 October 2016 (CA Executive Order 2).

In TX in 2015 the drought was ended when the reservoirs filled but the magnitude of the problem in CA is much greater; it would take almost double the yearly average rainfall in order to bring the conditions out of the bottom 20% of 4-year average accumulations. Further, many reservoirs in CA are filled via imports that come from snow melt in the mountains, which is expected to decrease this year. Also, El Nino is notoriously unpredictable, creating even greater uncertainty as to its effects (likelihood of not filling reservoirs: 95%). Further, the question states that even modifications to the rules count as an extension, this includes loosening (but not eliminating) restrictions. Given the info above regarding El Nino rainfalls, if the CA government decides to change usage rules, a loosening is much more likely than a total elimination (85%). -- @Mos The following text is from the fact sheet dated January 15, 2016 and titled, Extending the Emergency Water Conservation Regulation (Proposed Regulatory Changes to Achieve Statewide Reductions in Urban Potable Water Usage):"

15504,2016-01-20T15:39:55Z,1,[83.0],[83.0],"Pros: El Nino rainfalls will likely not be enough to sustainably fill CA reservoirs. In TX in 2015 the drought was ended when the reservoirs filled but the magnitude of the problem in CA is much greater; it would take almost double the yearly average rainfall in order to bring the conditions out of the bottom 20% of 4-year average accumulations. Further, many reservoirs in CA are filled via imports that come from snow melt in the mountains, which is expected to decrease this year. Also, El Nino is notoriously unpredictable, creating even greater uncertainty as to its effects (likelihood of not filling reservoirs: 95%). Further, the question states that even modifications to the rules count as an extension, this includes loosening (but not eliminating) restrictions. Given the info above regarding El Nino rainfalls, if the CA government decides to change usage rules, a loosening is much more likely than a total elimination (85%). Cons: El Nino is particularly strong this year and so far is concentrated in the upper part of California, where most of the state's reservoirs exist. Also, given El Nino's unpredictable nature, it is possible (5%) that we see an extraordinarily convenient weather pattern. Also, the question specifically states urban water use as opposed to agriculture water use. Urban use only accounts for about 20% of the state's water usage. This creates political uncertainty as the Democrat urban areas may feel unfairly burdened by the restrictions compared to the more Republican rural areas. However, there is little evidence of these political pressures at work (10%)."

I think that it's a 50/50 proposition whether the current restrictions will continue or not. The Sierras are receiving the most snow since the winter of 2010 - 2011. This will ease the stress on the state's reservoirs during the upcoming summer and fall. Restrictions will still be necessary in order to have sufficient surface water available to farmers so that they won't pump under ground water.

But the Governor will probably reduce the targets for some areas, such as San Diego.

The reason for increased water rates is secondary to a loss of revenue to cities from water restriction last year. Water will be billed much like electricity. Electricity is billed based on a tiered system. For example tier 1 would pay $1/unit. Tier 2 would be 2/unit. Each tier has an allotted number of units. Once you have consumed those units you move up to the next tier. This billing structure for electricity has changed peoples habits and forced many new residential solar power projects. Regarding water I'm not sure if there will be water restrictions from the state or just extreme water bills to mega water consumers. The water restrictions were very unpopular in California. California is a blue state and with elections this year the state may not chance restrictions again. Water districts may just crank up the price to control usage. I'm downgrading my forecast to 79%

In a similar vein, this winter’s precipitation will not likely bring an end to the drought. D4 drought covers more than half of the district (Figure 4, above left) and the longevity and severity of the current drought will likely defy one year’s worth of above normal precipitation. Therefore, expect some sort of drought conditions to continue into the spring. But this year should bring some relief to extreme fire danger which has gripped the state for the better part of 4 years."
