Moves of such magnitude would not be uncommon in most FX markets. However, while since August 2015 there has been greater market input in setting the RMB, ultimately the rate is controlled by the PBoC. What the US does (whether Trump, Congress or Fed is secondary). The overriding priority will be to avoid a disorderly movement either up or down, and the PBoC clearly still has sufficient foreign exchange reserves to support the currency at least in the near term. The RMB has been on a declining trend since the beginning of 2014 in large part due to dollar strength (see here for the trade-weighted chart https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TWEXB). Recently, the RMB has been relatively stable against other major currencies (e.g. the euro). The PBoC has been moving its focus away from just the dollar to a basket of currencies. Since the unexpected devaluation in August 2015, there have been four declines in the RMB of around 3-4% in any 68 day period. The biggest was 4.17% in January 2016. The time period in which the PBoC's current currency exchange policy has been in place is only relatively short (around 18 months). However, it seems unlikely that in just over the next 2 months the RMB will move outside the central band, even if there is a ""surprise"" event (e.g. the US declaring China a currency manipulator), I would estimate a move of such magnitude happening around once every 3 years, i.e. around 6% chance before end April. I think a depreciation is more likely than appreciation, giving the likely continued selling pressure from Chinese investors."

A drop to 6.6 or a climb to 7.2 would involve a 5% change over 98 days, which is a steeper change than has occurred over any 98 day period since 1/1/2012. The reason my forecast is only 90% is because of high volatility in the coming months as the Trump administration takes positions on trade (and China takes counter-positions) which I think will affect the relative strength of the two currencies. (Overall I think the strength of the dollar will drop in the short term because US markets will look unpredictable, meaning a dollar buys fewer yuan, and so this number goes down)"

Any decrease in the US current account deficit to China should put further downward pressure on the renminbi, but there is unlikely to be too big a change in the deficit by end of April, since a lot of deals settled between now and then have already been agreed upon. In addition, there are two FOMC meetings between now and end of April. The Fed won't raise rates again in January, but may do so in March if the unemployment and especially inflation figures support it.
