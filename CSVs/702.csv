This assumes that TSLA will have market returns which I am not sure is accurate given how it has moved over the past few months but I dont think I am better able to predict this value myself.

However, this has been the case for years now, therefore we need to find other ways to put a probability distribution around the stock price. A common way to do it is to use implied option prices and the values that market implies. Option deltas can often be used as an approximate for the probability that the markets imply for the event to occur. We use these values to come up with a probability distribution for the price. There are two main reason why such method could be used and might prove valid: (1) the wisdom of the crowd cannot be underestimated and has proven to be often right, (2) given how detached Tesla is from its fundamental valuation, it is the market that is driving and deciding about the price and not the other way round."
