After the plaintiff got a bad enough reputation that she no longer could find a new sucker, er, lawyer, it was trivial for me to win a judgment againsther. I see something similar in Waymo v Uber. Delay strengthens Waymo as Uber's management troubles proliferate and the reality of Uber's overall criminality becomes clearer. Delay long enough, and Uber's reconstituted management will settle. Or else Uber will implode, which would clear out one of Waymo's most serious competitors. Indeed, this lawsuit is an excellent vehicle for ferreting out Uber's deep dark secrets, and for inspiring Federal prosecutors to go after it and its managers."

Transport for London, which regulates ride-hailing services in the city, said the company’s “approach and conduct demonstrate a lack of corporate responsibility.” Andrew Testa for The New York Times By Amie Tsang and Michael J. de la Merced Transport for London, the city’s transportation regulator, said on Friday that it would not renew the ride-hailing service’s operating license when it expires on Sept. 30. The regulator, known as TfL, said in a statement on Twitter that it had concluded that Uber was “not fit and proper” to hold a private-hire operator license. It also argued that Uber had demonstrated a “lack of corporate responsibility in relation to a number of issues.” The regulator’s complaints also touched on: •The company’s approach to reporting serious criminal offenses, • Its approach to background checks on drivers for the service, and • Uber’s explanations about how it used Greyball software to prevent regulators from gaining full access to the app. Worth noting: Uber will appeal the decision, and can keep operating in London throughout the process. From a statement by an Uber spokesman: “Uber operates in more than 600 cities around the world, including more than 40 towns and cities here in the UK. This ban would show the world that, far from being open, London is closed to innovative companies who bring choice to consumers.” Joe Murphy, the political editor of London’s Evening Standard newspaper, had this to say on Twitter: “Uber employs 40,000 drivers in London alone. That’s like closing a town.” Related Reading The Wall Street Journal’s Greg Bensinger says that Benchmark, one of Uber’s earliest backers, won’t participate in a plan to let SoftBank buy out existing investors."" www.nytimes,com/dealbook"

36604,2017-07-25T18:15:50Z,1,[84.0],[84.0],"When researching the case, I found the exact details of what occurred. The case explicitly states a former Google (Waymo) employee secretly downloaded 14,000 files, created a self driving car startup, then had that startup bought by Uber. ""The complaint very specifically names the ways in which Levandowski stole the data."" as said in the case file. The case was brought up in February 2017, giving Uber and Google almost a year and a half to either settle, or have Uber be found liable. When reading up on These types of lawsuits I found ""In order to win a trade secret misappropriation suit in most states, the trade secret owner will need to show that the information at issue qualifies as a trade secret. It must be secret information that confers a competitive advantage and was the subject of reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. Also, the defendant must have improperly acquired the information or improperly disclosed it. Improper acquisition methods include espionage, fraud, theft, and bribery. Improper disclosure usually occurs when the person disclosing or publishing the information has reason to know it was improperly acquired."" which seems to fall directly under what is happening. Also when reading more up on the settlement itself, I found that ""Uber’s attorney told investors that a lawsuit over self-driving cars from Alphabet’s Waymo could be settled before a scheduled court date in October, though she said no formal agreement is in the works, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private."" according to Bloomberg. Although one could be lying to investors to show this isn't as big of a deal as it may seem. According to the same article, money is growing for Uber, so settling may be the right decision to clear the waters with all the scandals happening within the firm."
