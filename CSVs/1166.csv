The ANC's share of votes in local elections has declined to about 54% since 2016 following these controversies as party supporters either opt out of voting or support opposition parties like the Economic Freedom Fighters; however, there has been no data to suggest that a significant percentage of ANC party supporters have switched their support to these opposition groups (https://worldin2019.economist.com/southafricaselection). Following President Zuma's removal from power, Cyril Ramaphosa has been working to restore the party and the office of the president by criticizing those who supported Zuma. Although Zuma is supported among poor and rural factions who may be resurgent during this election cycle, it is very likely that Ramaphosa will win in South Africa's next election because the majority of black voters will not desert the party associated with Nelson Mandela and the abolition of apartheid (https://www.cfr.org/blog/despite-challenges-south-africas-anc-likely-remain-power). In addition, an Ipsos poll conducted from February to March of this year suggests that the ANC's main opposition parties will receive no more than 16% for the Democratic Alliance and 9% for the Economic Freedom Fighters parties (https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/sa-voter-turnout-will-be-critical-in-elections2019-ipsos-poll-19968042)."

Unemployment rose after the ANC’s rise to power in 1994, (and continues to rise) and the coincidence of high public sounding and low growth provides an unfavorable economic situation. There is discontent over land reform and property rights, the school system, and corruption. There isn’t indication of real plans to alter policies which could combat the issues within the administration and the ANC, which could damage public opinion. That said, the ANC has a lot of power, and has won in the past – opinion polls show support at 56.4%, which is lower than the 2014 elections but still significant. Incumbent advantage, success with institution of basic services, hope for Ramaphosa, division within the opposing party (DA), and historical role all give clout to the ANC. This makes it most likely that they will win between 50-60% of the votes, least likely that they will win less than 50%, and somewhat possible that they win over 60%."

The nominee for the ANC this year Cyril Ramaphosa, is running on a platform to root out and clean up much of Zuma's corruption and poor policy that had plundered South Africa's economy and caused such a promising state to collapse. Under Ramaphosa many in South Africa are hopeful he can be the one to enact change and clean up South Africa and give life back to its economy. The only real challenge to the ANC and Ramaphosa is the Democratic Alliance or (DA) who are led by nominee Mmusi Maimane. Although the DA is far less corrupt and a change of party could help South Africa, their political power in the country stops at the Provincial level as the national voting population of South Africa has historically in large numbers voted for the ANC. For these reasons it is likely that the ANC will win 50-60% of the votes and depending on the impact of the DA could be over 60% or less than 50%."
