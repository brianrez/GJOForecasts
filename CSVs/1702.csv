Access is further restricted by the presence of mines and IED’s” (https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/N1722473.pdf) FEWS NET states: “Large populations remain heavily dependent on humanitarian assistance for food access, the majority of whom are in Borno state.” (http://www.fews.net) There are frequently reports of attacks conducted by Boko Haram in Yobe and Borno, which carries the risk of elevating food insecurity. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-security/suspected-boko-haram-militants-kill-eight-soldiers-one-civilian-in-nigerias-northeast-police-idUSKBN1CU2XL https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/247875-four-killed-12-wounded-boko-haram-ambush-borno.html However, there are reports of improvements, such as market functionality and IDP’s returning home due to increased access in other areas. So, unless there is a large-scale withdrawal of humanitarian aid agencies, seems unlikely a famine will be declared in the next 2 months.

Although Mr Lowcock acknowledged that “millions of people are still at risk if more international help is not forthcoming”, I think its unlikely the UN will go back on its word in the next 3 months. Also, Boko Haram and general accessibility problems make it very unlikely that the UN can get into the rural areas and conduct the assessments needed to declare IPC Phase 5 - hence FEWS NETs “elevated risk” statements. See @lsgold7’s September 19 post about militant attacks on aid groups and @Wildwood2000. Boko Haram attacks - https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-14/boko-haram-defies-buhari-with-more-attacks-in-northeast-nigeria Consider the likelihood of famine declaration depending on Boko Haram and any move the Nigerian government makes in the short term to counter the insurgency. In theory, with Boko Haram eradicated from rural areas, accessibility improves and assessments can be conducted to determine the IPC level. But again, can this be done within the next 3 months?"

For example, many people in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States remain in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) food insecurity, with an increased risk of high levels of acute malnutrition and mortality. Less accessible areas, particularly in Borno State, experience similar or worse conditions and continue to face an elevated risk of Famine (IPC Phase 5) in 2017. Markets remain well stocked with local and imported food, helping to meet rising demand during the lean season. However, food prices are rising seasonally as household stocks decline and households become more market dependent. These increases are more pronounced in the eastern basin, particularly in the Lake Chas Basin where market flows remain disrupted by civil insecurity, and in Nigeria where the depreciation of the Naira enables the rise of prices in the areas in conflict. Despite the increase in market demand until the next harvest in September/October, prices will remain close to average levels throughout the region except in Nigeria. http://www.fews.net/west-africa/food-security-outlook/july-2017 Dropping further on this"

Pro · refugees coming back in devastated communities · still a lot of displaced person · media articles cited by many of other forecaster seemingly underline how severe the food crisis is or might become: indeed, it could become a very severe humanitarian crisis that would ask for the highest levels of signalling the crisis and the need for help… Con · FEWSNET country report seems to be not too pessimistic · they write of ""increased risk of famine"", not famine as such (http://www.fews.net/west-africa/nigeria) · access to the areas seems to improve a bit, so help is underway (http://www.fews.net/west-africa/nigeria) · in the projection of the food shortages the territory with a rating of 5 does not expand (but probably the affected people within this territory) · access to the areas seems might be - at least to some parts - very difficult, with extreme difficulty in data collection --> UN needs valid information since her declaration of a famine must be signal, not noise: a 'false positive' may harm the future willingness of stakeholders to take action if famine is declared vs. @AB747 comment on helicopter (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/497989): however, that does not guarantee a valid data collection · There is some liklihood that the forecast of a famine could be self-defeating since all stakeholders have an interest in preventing the famine (except Boko Harem; may be even Nigeria could lobby against this declaration in order in an effort to maintain its reputation: but if so, could they prevent a declaration?). Boko Harem is contained, international help is underway etc.; so, paradoxically, media coverage on the subject could be a sign for preventing famine. I also would like to comment on @boz comment: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/494347 · The first two points point to Nigeria's reputation and influence… I am not sure about the preferences of Nigerias Gov since it could also help Nigeria to have a famine declaration by the UN (resources, help, media coverage concerning a problem they cannot handle due to their failing and failed states characteristics; and democratic norm may not hinder the declaration of a humanitarian catastrophe); I am also not sure whether they have so much influence to prevent a declaration. · The third point on resources goes both ways as @boz admits. · The points on FEWSNET are striking, however. · The last point on the UN is a little overdrawn. However, it could well be that the UN is trying to avoid a noisy declaration, i.e. that is not valid - as I pointed out above. All in all: it is a very hard question. Given the momentum of the situation to become worse and worse, the chances are above the 50 percent threshold. But it is far from certain. My guess is that we are around 66 to 80 percent. The most serious problem is that we seem to know very little on how the decision processes on famine declaration are organized and which stakeholders do a power play, which preferences they have, how much salience these preference have to them and how much influence they can have… Also we lack the understanding of the dynamics of famine crisis, e.g.: How likely is it that a famine can be prevented once it was diagnosed as (very) likely to happen and thereby mobilizing international help to prevent it? --> Does anyone have ideas on that?"

However; Three UN agencies — Food and Agriculture Organisation, World Food Programme and International Fund for Agricultural Development –reported that Nigeria was one of the countries that would suffer famine, food shortage and malnutrition. The Federal Government has denied the reports by some United Nations (UN) agencies of imminent famine in Nigeria. There is no threat of starvation in the country, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, told newsmen in Abuja.

These concerns are not restriction to Nigeria but also include Somalia, South Sudan, and Yemen. It has made an appeal of $4B, to start, in order to ameliorate the immediate and short term needs of these states. Even if the appeal is met, it is likely that increased factors will increase needed conditions for amelioration. Of major concern is not only the problem of food security but the attendant and likely instability and fragility that will occur in these states; with current or base rate instability and fragility in all four states, further deterioration (including the likely loss of millions of citizens, refugees and other displaced people in these countries) are anticipated. A famine has already been declared by the UN in February for parts of South Sudan. Human Insecurity resulting in famine and deaths including diminishing supplies of water, among other factors, drive the concerns of political stability and fragility. While these two factors have been of concern for some time the base rate in the states are increasing problematic from a policy point of view; with weak resilience under fragility the e,pit is imply an horizon of exponential crises."
