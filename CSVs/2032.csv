Will either the Palestinian Authority or Israel announce a halt in security cooperation before 1 July 2016?,2015-11-10T18:00:36Z,2016-07-01T06:59:36Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']","['Foreign Policy', 'Security and Conflict']",1393,654,409,237,"This question resolved on 30 June 2016: Security cooperation remains in place (Hareetz, CNN, Al Jazeera). In 2016, crises elsewhere in the Middle East will distract from the Palestinian question, which smoulders on (The World in 2016). The formal security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) established by the Oslo Accords has only been suspended once, during the second intifada (Al-Monitor). Although escalating violence has heightened concerns about a new intifada and the Palestinian Liberation Organization attempted to halt cooperation in the spring of 2015, security cooperation between the PA and Israel has continued (NY Times, BBC, Al-Monitor, Washington Institute ).

This development could not have been imaginable without ongoing Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation.

I think both sides will take care not to openly back out of the UN efforts in this case, though neither side is happy the arrangement."
