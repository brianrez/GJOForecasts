La actual fecha de lanzamiento es el 30 de abril, sin embargo, uno de los inversores que habló con el equipo encargado de TON, afirmó que es bastante improbable que esto alcancen la fecha límite. ""Votamos por esperar, aunque estamos seguros de que Telegram no podrá aclarar las cosas con la SEC"", dijo uno de los inversores de TON a CoinDesk bajo condición de anonimato. Tomando como supuesto que los problemas existentes entre Telegram y la SEC son demasiado complejos y tomarán varios meses en resolverse, mi predicción es, con un 90%, que la opción más probable es que TON no se lanzará antes de Octubre 2020. Siguiéndole con un 8% está la opción de que sea lanzada entre mayo y septiembre 2020, y ya con 2% que la aplicación salga antes de mayo 2020, ya que estando a mitades de abril y sin tener mayor información o avances en los acuerdos realizados con la SEC, es posible asumir que es realmente improbable que TON sea lanzado antes de esta fecha."
