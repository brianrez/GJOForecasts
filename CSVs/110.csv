As the election is approaching, the White House is doing a better job of managing public opinion than it did a few months ago. The first approval poll post student loan relief showed upward movement in Biden's approval: https://engine-insights.com/blog/public-opinion-polling/ So he stands at 41.9% right now, which is a pretty good cushion. Given that he won 51% of the vote in 2020, these marginal approvals in the 40s are the easiest to win back. Finally, if you go back in time to before mid June, he was always above 40. It shouldn't be too difficult to maintain that, if the White House can just do the bare minimum."

I wouldn't say we're heading into a GFC level crisis, but recessions are a good determinant of Presidential approval and signs point to a global one on the way. Add on the recent SCOTUS decisions, failure to pass major legislation, and the slow revitalisation of Trumpism in the republican party. I don't see much if any room for his approval to increase. The harder question is timing, and I don't think we'll see it dip below 35 until the mid terms in November."
