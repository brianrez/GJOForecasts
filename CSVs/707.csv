But the main development that leads me to raise is the return of the two Michaels to Canada following the US decision on Meng Wanzhou. Earlier, the CCP claimed the two cases were unrelated. Yet, both planes—one carrying Meng to China and one carrying the Michaels home—were in the air at the same time, leaving no doubt that (1) the Michaels’ arrest was an exercise in hostage diplomacy and (2) the CCP decided to drop all pretenses on this matter. In other words, Xi’s China is sending a message to the world that it will engage in hostage diplomacy whenever it sees it expedient to do so and does not fear (expect?) consequences. The US and allies might think twice before sending their citizens to China, knowing all pretense of good faith is gone."

Most of my comments from the previous forecasts on this subject are still valid, but the answer is changing due to additional pressure that is pilling up. If more voices are rallying for boycott, I would probably have to increase the % as this becomes more likely. The subject even got a Wiki page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerns_and_controversies_at_the_2022_Winter_Olympics For the western world there are 2 major antagonistic aspects, the economic one and the social one. There are tens of western companies planning to increase their Chinese investments this year and in the following ones for higher profits. The subject is counterproductive for them. They are not necessarily against the boycott but would definitely want to stop the evolution of this subject which could lead for economic sanctions and jeopardies their ROI. On the other side the social voice asking for boycott becomes stronger and stronger. UK parliamentarians voted for diplomatic boycott. https://www.skysports.com/olympics/news/15234/12356751/beijing-2022-mps-in-house-of-commons-support-diplomatic-boycott-of-next-years-winter-olympics-in-china The vote is not the final word for now. The Foreign Office minister Nigel Adams response is: ""As the Prime Minister has previously made clear, no decisions have yet been made about UK Government attendance at those Winter Olympics in Beijing."", meaning the situation is prone to change if there is a higher political pressure. Boris Johnson statement should also be taken into boycott equation, he said he is ""instinctively and always have been against sporting boycotts."" The subject is set to evolve. Human rights groups are mounting international pressure against China’s hosting the games to draw attention to Beijing abuses against Uighurs, Tibetans and residents of Hong Kong. From Reuters to Aljazeera many newsfeeds are commenting the subject. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/8/china-warns-of-robust-response-if-us-boycotts-winter-olympics On April 21, Susanne Lyons, chair of the United States Olympic Paralympic Committee (USOPC), said “We at the USOPC oppose athlete boycotts because they have shown to negatively impact athletes while not effectively addressing global issues in the past.” Not less important is the financial aspect mentioned by Susanne Lyons, that boycotts put ""unfair pressure"" on corporate sponsors who provide the bulk of financial support for athletes and athletic programs over the long term. Also, despite the more recent US State department documents about human rights violation in China, the administration didn't release yet any statement that refers to Olympics boycott. As of 19 Jul, I consider a 40% chance is a realistic view, which says that given the actual development on this subject it is less likely that an Olympic boycott will follow, but things could flip."

I don’t think the current president is ignorant of all the parallels with the situation in 1980 or how much it contributed to a sense of the country heading in the wrong direction. Outside view: the enormous power of the Olympics for generating cash for U.S. companies is even more pronounced compared with then.

It is not for the 1st time US is raising this issue. In 2020, the US imposed sanctions and visa restrictions against several Chinese government officials, in response to the Uyghur genocide and human rights abuses in Hong Kong and Tibet. If more convergent statements at state level are coming in the next months the probability will increase. Any US Olympic committee decision should be based on something. In this case would be US official statements, and this makes a strong bond between US administration and Olympic committee. Historically China doesn't engage in public debates about something considered ""internal affair"". But if US goes for a boycott is not only US-China trade at stake. EU and the Muslim world could adopt a similar stance. Historically, when engaging in an international action, US always looked for allies to take US side and give weight. Today, China’s economic power depends on free trade and at global scale. The boycott on Olympics could be followed by international wide economic sanctions which pending on the duration could affect Xi Jinping 2025 announced development plans for China and challenge his authority. Even he is a president for life with dictatorial power, a long-term drawback in standards of living for common Chinese people is not something easy to go with. Also there is a risk that a new round of trade disputes will set US-China economic relations on a new base, and bilateral sanctions will become a norm. Therefore, there is a probability that China might accept an international commission investigation to alleviate the situation. This can gain time for China and go over the deadline for a go/ no go decision. On top, a positive turnaround can be politically used by Xi to pose in a victim of unfounded accusations and extend this on other hot issues like democracy in Hong Kong or Covid origin. Can also be used for putting the blame on US intelligence services for misinformation, many are still remembering about Saddam and his mass destruction weapons. For now, there is a low probability to have a boycott. Need to wait and see if more are coming."

95712,2021-05-17T09:06:42Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"It appears the White House is unsure of their current position on a Winter Games boycott with the Washington Post writing on 12 April, ""The Biden administration offered somewhat mixed messaging this week"" (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/04/12/olympics-china-boycott/) . Political boycotts of The Games tend not to change a hosting government's position but only serves to disadvantage athletes. The State Department in January 2021 declared ""that China’s actions against Uighurs should be categorized as 'genocide'"" and as a result the US banned imports of goods made in Xinjiang, citing ""a risk of forced labor in the region."" (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/02/11/china-uighurs-genocide-xinjiang/). But while banning imports from Xinjiang is promising, IMO if the US wanted to make a strong statement about China's treatment of the Uyghurs, they would embargo the trade of select lucrative goods with China, not just the region in question. A scenario so very unlikely to happen - it's a chess move too dangerous. The US conveying their distaste with the tokenism of not sending a team to the Winter Games appears weak and without consequence. Therefore, I do not think that the US Olympic Committee will boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics on political grounds. I think it's more likely Covid-19 will disrupt the Winter Games should variants emerge from India and vaccines become less effective."

Now, both CNN and the BBC have published deeply reported and horrifying accounts of rape, abuse, and torture detailed by Uyghur women who'd been held in China's internment camps. [...] These testimonies should also compel Biden to reconsider US involvement in the Olympic Games. Too often in the past, hosting the Olympics has allowed authoritarian regimes to peddle propaganda and gain legitimacy -- from the Nazis in 1936 to the Soviets in 1980 to the Chinese Communist Party in 2008 and Vladimir Putin's Russia in 2014. In response to China's oppression of Uyghur communities and other human rights abuses, over 180 human rights groups and international legislators are calling for the 2022 Winter Olympics to be moved from Beijing or boycotted altogether. [...] We need all hands on deck for this effort and the international community should declare with one voice that participation in the Olympics depends on progress for Uyghurs. [...]This time has to be different. As the Biden administration works to reorient American foreign policy to ensure that it aligns with American values, it must signal to the world that China's treatment of the Uyghurs won't be tolerated.""

While it appears that the majority of these groups are not western agencies per se, it definitely is a larger step in the direction of highlighting the humans rights abuses China is committing, as well as their failed vow to improve their human rights record after their last Olympic hosting duties in 2008. The IOC does not intend to get involved, declaring their agency does not involve itself in inner politics. This question focuses on USOC. If more and more agencies begin to call for a boycott, or athletes themselves declare that they will not participate (think along the lines of Mesut Ozil, formerly of Arsenal FC, who was, more or less, blackballed by calling out these atrocities in china), we might see USOC start to shift their position in wanting to be on the ""right side of history.""

The last time Olympic games were boycotted by any country was in 1988. While boycotts have appeared in the past, it has happened sparingly. However, this day and age feels different. Influence campaigns through mass media, especially throughout the pandemic, have been widespread and athletes are taking less of a ""me"" approach and more of a ""worldly"" approach. The calls are increasing for a boycott in 2022 and this would be a major message sending to China that would have political and potentially military ramifications while completely destroying China's ""face"" in the process. While this would certainly be a political act, it would also affect the athletes who pour their heart and soul into preparing for the Olympic games and it would be interesting to see what those athletes would have to say about a potential boycott. At this point, there is a lot of time and it is too early to tell, so there is a slight chance this happens, but that could increase as time goes by and more and more calls are made."

From Economist “Australian senators will today consider whether or not to boycott the Winter Olympics in Beijing in 2022. The treatment of protesters in Hong Kong and Uyghurs in Xinjiang, as well as the risk of Australians being arbitrarily detained, are more than enough reason to shun the games, according to the senators who introduced the motion. Some politicians in America and Britain agree. The Summer Olympics in Beijing in 2008 were also controversial, particularly among pro-Tibet activists, but there was hope then that the games might herald greater dialogue between China and the West. Those hopes have largely evaporated. The International Olympic Committee insists that boycotts do more harm than good. Whether that is a principled stand or a compromise of convenience (the only other bidder for the 2022 games was Kazakhstan) is debatable. But discussion of boycotts brings attention to China’s nefarious activities. For the campaigners, even that is to be prized.“"

The Australian Sports Minister has said his instinct is to separate Politics from sport. 160 Human right groups have called for the IOC to not hold the 2022 winter games in Beijing. Biden may be a factor should he win the US Presidential election as he has called the repressive treatment of the Uighurs to be genocide. Pompeo has proposed an alliance of democracy to derail Chinese authoritarian ambitions. Cancelling the Olympics would send a message. Canada is a powerful force in winter sports and commentary from there is stirring. Australia and the UK seem to be the most vocal, but neither could be considered a world force in winter sports and would have less Olympic level sports people to upset. There is an option to move the Games to another venue which void the premise of the question that is just looking at boycotting the games in general. The movement to take the games away for Beijing is only beginning to build momentum. The US election is pivotable and nothing will happen before January 1st, 2021 as finalising the election (postal votes) might take time and there is still the question of the pandemic."

In general its getting harder for the IOC to find host countries to fund the olympics because of the huge financial burden, and so cutting off China seems like a huge financial burden.

The Uighur mistreatment is bad, but it appears much of the current discussion for boycotting is posturing by various US political operatives. For one thing, the current rhetoric against China makes me think the American public and their representatives would like nothing more than to go out and beat the Chinese on their own turf. A classic and ever present case of American exceptionalism. For another, the President essentially okayed the building of the Uighur camps in order to avoid stalling his trade negotiations with Xi. This would be brought back into the spotlight if the US boycotted the 2022 Olympics, so if he is in charge it is difficult to see why or how the US would forgo the glory and ratings of an Olympic spectacle for the moral high ground.

Under a Biden administration, I expect that pressure to have a significant likelihood of being effective, especially if some high profile US athletes opt not to go individually. I'll estimate that at 40%. A Trump presidency could go one of two ways. In general, he appreciates spectacle and displays of nationalism, which suggests he'd strongly prefer the US to compete.
