The German Federal Ministry for Health so far expected 10.1mn doses of the single-shot Janssen vaccine in the second quarter of 2021 (April, May, June)), but received only 1.7mn of these doses and only 1.2mn doses have yet been administered. It is unclear whether the Emergent incident will cause a total collapse of deliveries in Q2 2021 and beyond, but it already means that those 8.4mn doses outstanding will have to be replaced by about 17mn doses of any other (two-shot-regimen) vaccine, and potentially delays the federal German vaccination campaign by ONE MONTH on average (Berlin being in the mid field)."

It hinges on Covid-19 in particular since the staff already has been hired and trained so in March they definetly planned to open the doors. Its a bet will Germany finally gets it hold on Covid with vaccination etc. For the next 4 week 100 % certainty to be remained closes since a federal lockdown is coming in Germany. Afterwards Germany and Berlin in particular needs some good news and distraction. In July August Septermber since there are federal elections enternainmant wil come back - panem et circensis !!!! They will open i believe.
