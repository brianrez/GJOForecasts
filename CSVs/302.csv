However, that growth was not a straight-line growth with a very flattened curve since 2019 (https://greenfdc.org/countries-of-the-belt-and-road-initiative-bri/). 61 countries joined in 2018, 14 in 2019, and only 1 in 2020. (https://www.cfr.org/blog/countries-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-whos-and-whos-out) As well, given the negative attention BRI received in some parts of the world, it is less likely for a country to sign a BRI MOU now or in the next year than before COVID-19 (especially with Australia cancelling their BRI deal with China earlier this year (https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210421-australia-cancels-state-s-belt-and-road-deal-with-china). Layer on top of that the Biden announced ""Build Back Better World (B3W)"" program to compete with BRI, especially in Latin America (https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/10/01/china-belt-road-initiative-latin-america-united-states-g-7-build-back-better-world-investment/). So, even in a post-COVID-19 world, if we get there in 2022, there is likely to only be a few additions to BRI for China by the end of 2022. My money is on the 3 to 4 range (65%), or possibly even less in the 1 to 2 range (30%)."
