"In Air and Liquid Systems Corp. v. Devries, will the Supreme Court rule that Air and Liquid Systems Corp. can be held liable for negligence in exposing service members to asbestos?",2018-09-21T17:00:48Z,2019-03-19T17:00:20Z,Yes,"['Yes', 'No']",['US Policy'],158,654,89,237,"In 2014, the widows of US naval servicemen who died of cancer allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos lost a civil suit against Air and Liquid Systems Corp. (Court House News). The Third Circuit reversed that decision, ruling that the company could be held liable for negligence even though their products were not manufactured with asbestos (Oyez). The Supreme Court is expected to hand down its decision in its 2018 term (SCOTUSBlog), but if it does not, the question will resolve as no. Confused?

Thus, given the Roberts Court's propensity towards narrow opinions, the opinion in this case will likely not shut the door on the Defendant's liability. Rather, I expect a remand supporting the Third Circuit opinion and direction for that Court to explore the merits of proposed remedies. Is there a tort expert here to poke holes in my analysis? Isn't this an ""as applied"" case where Scotus really has no way to determine some bright line ruling? Eventually, the lower courts may decide that the Defendant owes $0 or $4 billion."
