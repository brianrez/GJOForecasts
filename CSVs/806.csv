They have been extremely vigilant about shutting down every tie there is a spike in any location, and have the central controls to implement immediate lockdowns 3. Baring a major new outbreak. Probability of it climbing by over 2,00 new cases in a month are slim. Which is why I have left a 15% probability of having a second major spike in the next month."
