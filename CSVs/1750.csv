Forecast: Raise 80 %, Maintain 20% and lower 0%. The information shown in figure 1 is the monthly development in the effective federal funds rate since July 1954. Remarkable are the peaks of the funds rate in the eighties (maximum? When?) and the extreme minimums around 2010 (minimum? When?). As becomes clear from the graph the development of the federal funds rate is divided in increasing and decreasing trends, the trends lasts for several months and sometimes years. This implies that if the effective federal funds rate has risen in the previous month, the probability of an increase in the rate in the next month is higher than the chance of a decrease. Therefore it becomes useful to look at the most recent trend. Figure 2 shows clearly a gradually increasing trend in the effective federal funds rate. This increase started in November 2015, with a rate just above 0.1% and is was between 0,6% and 0,7% in the most recent data. The trend does not seem to have reached it’s peak yet, since it is still gradually increasing until January 2017. However, the question is not about the effective federal funds rate, but about the targeted federal fund rate by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The decision to use the data of the effective federal funds rate can be justified by showing that the effective federal funds rate usually follow the targeted federal funds rate. If one compares figure 2 & 3, it becomes clear that when the FOMC decided to raise the limit if of the target rate from 0,25% to 0,5% in January 2016, the effective rate increased quickly to a rate just below 0.4% and continued to increase slowly after that time. A similar development is shown when the FOMC raised the limit of the target rate to 0,75% in the end of 2016. Thus, these two figures highly correlate with each other and therefore the effective federal funds rate can be used as an indicator of the targeted federal funds rate by the FOMC."

They raise rates for political reasons. They raise rates to maintain public confidence. They suggested they were going to raise rates three times in 2015 and we got one extremely small raise at the end of the year. They said they would raise rates multiple times in 2016 and we again got one extremely small raise at the end of the year. If they raised rates again in March after recently raising rates in December that would send a message to the market that they are ready to start raising rates more aggressively.

Instead, we think March would be a good meeting for them to prepare the markets for a hike at the subsequent meeting on May third,"" the economists wrote. Most Fed watchers have forecast a June rate hike. Goldman Sachs economists also said that based mostly on the hotter inflation reading, the likelihood of a March hike increased to 30 percent from 20 percent, but they also see a better chance for May."" http://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/15/a-march-rate-hike-isnt-a-lock-but-the-odds-probably-just-got-better.html"
