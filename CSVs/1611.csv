I looked at the average of month-to-month increases and decreases to get a sense how much movement typically happens month to month. In the last eight months - the central bank lowered the discount rate at the end of July for the 8th straight month - only one adjustment would have stayed within the same band from month to month. Thus the low probably of staying the same. I think downward is more likely than upward from a quick review of some macro fundamentals. A lot of this is probably a guess.
