Considering that there’s still much of the “fire season” ahead of us, putting a fairly low chance on bin #1. The rate of change here is obviously going to be highly variable, depending on how many and how large any given moment’s active fires are across the country. The final cumulative count will also be correspondingly difficult to extrapolate from, e.g., simple YTD observations.
