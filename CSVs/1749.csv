The year has already been very sanguine and given the lack of volatility previously and the generally positive forward looking environment I find a very low likelihood that the S&P 500 will fall by 20% or more over the next 8 days. Also, many portfolio managers will not make any bold moves given that its the end of the year. The only item to push the market lower is a 'black swan' event. I give it a 1% probability of happening over the next 8 days. That is why I am projecting that its a 1% 'Yes' that the market will fall 20% or more."

I think a 10% decline is much more likely, with some possible trigger events being the Debt Ceiling and Government continued funding approvals coming up in a few months. Another external factor could be election outcomes in Europe causing investor uncertainty, though I would suspect most would be short lived events. Expansion of conflict in various regions could affect investor confidence, or trigger a sell-off, though it's tougher to predict where and when.

These years were characterized by overinflated stock values and “unusual circumstances”, e.g., oil price shocks, extremely high interest rates, the 1987 flash crash, the Internet bubble and the collapse of the housing market. By some measures (Shiller CAPE PE10) the current stock market is significantly over-valued (by almost 50%). However, using the data at http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm and fitting a curve to the total real value over time suggests that the overvaluation is a less ominous 10%, which is historically not unusual. Over the decades, the dividend rate has declined while total real value has faithfully followed an exponential growth rate, which is only explained by higher price-to-earnings ratios. There is certainly potential for an ""unusual circumstance"" to develop during the year, but baring such an occurrence, the current direction of the economy is generally positive, and a 20% drawdown rate appears high."

But, again, looking at long period and the current high score of the index aren't chances of a big drop considerably. Am still looking for guidance here. How important is geopolitical uncertainty that does not manifest itself in events and policies that hit corporate performance? What if the majority thinks the same and uncertainty translates into doubt among investors, starting up a vicious circle downwards?

If we take the past 20 years this corresponds with a chance of 15%. However, in the same period he S&P has dropped well over 20% in one (calendar) year twice in the same period with a time difference of roughly 7 years and has now steadily been rising for the past 8 years to reach its highest level ever. Looking from this perspective, the chance may be considered higher that 'it' will happen again the longer this takes. Add to this the high uncertainty that surrounds the election and behaviour of president Trump, the Brexit, the Chinese economy and geopolitical tensions, chances that the S&P 500 will drop 20% within this year increase. Subtract that uncertainty in the past years hasn't affected the S&P index, the currently healthy profits of companies and the fact that the longer it takes before the drop sets in, the lower chances are that the 20% drop will exactly happen in 2017. In fact, looking at the two other 20+% drop, chances would be higher that it happens in 2018. Currently, looking at the index since January 1st, the index has increased. When we see a significant start of a drop, chances increase considerably, the longer it takes, the lower the chances."

33862,2017-02-22T15:59:06Z,1,[12.0],[12.0],"I think it is impossible to try to ""forecast"" a market crash based on logical reasoning. The CBOE has daily prices on its website going back 30 years (1986). During that time there have been five years in which the S&P500 has fallen more than 20% intra year: 1987, 2001, 2002, 2008, 2009 Arguably 2002 and 2009 should be discounted as they are existing bear markets. However, there were also 2 years with very near misses 1991 (-19.9%) and 1998 (-19.2%), so perhaps 5 in 30 is a reasonable starting point. Looking further back I could only find monthly price data which is less accurate. There was definitely a 20%+ drop in 1974, suggesting 6 20%+ falls in the last 50 years. The fact that such falls are so irregular makes estimating the likelihood difficult. Does the fact that the S&P is at an all time high and arguably overvalued increase the likelihood? Possibly. However, I don't think there is anything to suggest markets will be particularly volatile in 2017 relative to previous years. The spate of recent ""flash crashes"" in other markets and widespread automated trading suggests the chances of a crash similar to 1987 are higher. Overall, I think 1/7 for the full year is reasonable - around 12% adjusted for the fact we are nearly 2 months into the year."

There has never been a bubble like this before, so looking at historic data really is not appropriate. Very few people buy treasuries for actual investment purposes anymore. China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia are all selling off their u.s. debt. The only real buyers now are the European Union and Japan, and they are buying treasuries for political reasons, not for investment reasons. With the US relationship with Saudi Arabia finally starting to deteriorate, if Saudi Arabia decided to end the petrodollar that would certainly trigger the crash. Or the fact that inflation is finally starting to rise could signal the beginning of the crash as well. The FED is not going to be able to combat the sluggish economy and riising inflation at the same time. They don't have the political will to raise rates the way Paul volcker did in the seventies. But I thought all of this before. I thought that when China stop supporting the dollar that would be the beginning of the end. I thought when China started selling treasuries aggressively that would be the beginning of the end.

Of course this doesn't mean prices will increase with 20%, but it wont lower price of stock either. Trump has a team of skilled finance people who aim for the same: lower taxes. So while p/e may look high, they aint abnormal high and fair when corporate tax will be lowered from 35% to 20%. I put in 4 % since Trump is a controversial president and there is a likelyhood he'd be either shot by an extremist (6 of the 45 presidents were shot, of whom 4 were killed) or maybe forced to resign, but i consider that change pretty small.
