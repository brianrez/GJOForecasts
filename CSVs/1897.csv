I use the data from 2012 as a proxy http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/campaign-finance Between 7% and 10% in November and between 24% and 25% in October (at least 1/3 of it will be after the 19th of October). => 7% +24%/3=15% and 10%+25%/3=18.3% With those number I am between 245million and 255 million.

We should get spending through October 19 by the time this question closes. Plus some spending by outside groups. I'm going to guess $75 million from the Trump campaign plus outside groups. That would be under $250 million. I will stick with that until I see the September number.

Current spend total of $139,979,000 is an increase of approx 43,000,000 (29 from committee and 14 from outside) since Aug. 22nd. Over the past two months outside spend has increased from approx 3,000,000 to 14,000,000 per month. To date Trump has raised 201m and spent 140m, with about 64m raised in the past month from all sources. Donations have incresed, but the required increase in spend over the next month to $110,000,000 might be too much. Seems unlikely that Trump's spend will cross the $250,000,000 mark, although further large increases in outside money may make a difference."

Because this question asks for the amount that will be reported on November 1st, there are only two more months of campaign totals to be reported, so Trump would have to see a massive spike in fundraising to reach 500 million."

The failure of the RNC to produce a significant poll bump may finally force deep pocketed donors and outside groups to commit funds. Add the ""Russia"" flap, and their best bet at getting control of the message, and influencing down-ticket outcomes, may be to end-run the messenger with on-script media. This raises the chances that spending will cross the $250M mark, and even the $500M mark. But $750M seems out of reach at this late date and with Mr. Trump's high negatives.

The fact that roughly ten percent of all campaign spending runs through Trump entities will not be lost on donors. Neither will his polling numbers in June, which were lackluster at best. A bigger bang for the deep-pocketed buck may be had further down the ticket, making a skewed fundraising picture all the more likely. Holding the House and state legislatures (at least) will become the primary orientation of top Republican officials, as their ability to influence the presumptive nominee is fully acknowledged. Meanwhile, as money fails to come in, the presidential campaign will take on a different, less costly, media aspect. This will not harm the candidate, however. He has already received so much free publicity that his name recognition is total. Neither does he need to spend money outlining policy; he makes that up on the spot... in 140-character cost-free bursts. And then there's the convention. Despite themselves-- and I include myself here-- millions of voters will tune in just for the Dionysian excess. (A gold balloon drop?) Debates, likewise, come at low (no) cost to the candidate, and will certainly have monstrous audiences. Having come this far while spending so little on conventional campaigning, I can't see a compelling reason for Mr. Trump to change strategies now. Leave advocacy ads to the outside groups; they'll pick up the tab eventually."
