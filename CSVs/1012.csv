Frustrated with the slow pace of multilateral efforts to reform the global tax system—and the piddling amounts paid in France by tech giants—last July the French government introduced a revenue tax on certain big digital companies. But a USTR investigation concluded the policy discriminated against American companies and has proposed imposing retaliatory tariffs on $2.4bn of French imports. It is hard to see how further confrontation can be avoided. A grand bargain on tax reform could defuse tensions, but the Trump administration has recently seemed to sour on the idea. Phil Hogan, the EU’s trade commissioner, will try to soothe relations when he meets with Robert Lighthizer, the USTR’s top official, in Washington next week. But at this point, his task may simply be one of damage control.”"
