But even so if they do get upgraded to hurricanes there will only be 9 which stay between the range of 7 to 9.

Probably a post-season analysis will determine this later past the close date, even later than the December 16 criteria (and as late as May or June 2023 based on the publishing patterns of a few seasonal reports I've seen) but it's still not out of the realms of reality that such a revision occurs sooner. Also, we cannot rule out an anomalous hurricane to form past November 30 and before the official resolution last day of December 16 (one full month to go as of today)."

As stated by Earth Sky there are less hurricanes in November due to cooler ocean temperatures. They also state that there have only been 58 hurricanes in November between 1851-2015. This is less that one hurricane a year on average in a 164-year time span. Lastly a 30-year climate period from 1991-2020 by the National Hurricane Center states that on average there are 7 hurricanes during hurricane season in the United States. In conclusion, I believe that there is an 80% chance that there will be between 4 and 6 hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean during the 2022 hurricane season. This is because this hurricane season has a less than average number of hurricanes in total and ends in a month, November, which has a less than average number of hurricanes. Knowing this it is highly likely that there will not be more than two more hurricanes before the 2022 hurricane season ends."

This is based on the following EvidenceEvidence: NOAA, in an outlook report for the 2022 season, estimated 6-10 hurricanes with 20 named storms (Climate Prediction Center - Atlantic Hurricane Outlook (noaa.gov)). This figure shows that half of the precited number would develop into major storms. With another prediction from NOAA, which offers a 65% chance of the above-typical season, the figure more reasonably fits (NOAA predicts above-normal 2022 Atlantic Hurricane Season | National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). This number is backed by several climate factors that NOAA lists as contributing to the potential for an abnormal season (predicts above-normal 2022 Atlantic Hurricane Season | National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). Based on the Evidence provided due to climate factors 10-12 within the season seems plausible."

It's possible, but I'm doubting it since late October to November sees relatively little activity. Also, the strongest hurricanes tend to occur in October, and since the next 10 days looks quiet, it's hard for me to be convinced November would give us one.

Essentially my model says the number of hurricanes is a function of sea surface temperature anomaly - and I distinguish three categories. The idea is that how lower the SSTA, the higher the number of hurricanes. So far, so good. However, when I compute the distributions based on low, medium and high SSTA and subsequently compute expected number of hurricanes, I get 7.5, 7.6 and 5.7, respectively. Effectively, by my model, it makes no difference whether SSTA is in the (i.e., MY) low or medium bin. I should have checked that prior to posting my first forecast. That gives me two 'challenges' with respect to this forecast question: (i) build a proper model and (ii) figure out how to adjust the model for the fact that we've not seen any hurricanes in the first two months (almost, anyway) of the hurricane season."

Additionally, a forecast of mine [that is a month old] predicts this year has an above normal chance of becoming the hottest year on record since record keeping. I have since decreased the probability a bit for this latter question but it is my judgement that this correlation will lead to an above normal frequency of hurricanes this season. In both the Pacific and the Atlantic basins? Now that's a separate question. I don't know."
