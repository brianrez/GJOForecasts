Will the US or the UN impose any new sanctions on Iran before 18 October 2016?,2016-02-09T18:00:53Z,2016-03-24T17:00:39Z,Yes,"['Yes', 'No']",['Foreign Policy'],718,654,334,237,"In January 2016, the U.S. imposed new sanctions in response to Iran's October ballistic missile test (Treasury Department, NY Times, BBC).

This was evident in the Jan 2016 sanctions that took effect even as Iran released some high-profile prisoners.
