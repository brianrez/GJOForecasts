A reasonably good estimate for any given day is to take the average of the 2021 and 2019 screening data. 2020, for obvious reasons, seems irrelevant. Since the beginning of November, this average has underestimated the actual 2022 screening totals by about 50,000 screenings per day. Adding in the average from 2019 and 2021 for the remaining 17 days gives a forecast of 65.87m total screenings. Adding back the 50,000 underestimate per day gets a forecast of 66.7m screenings, which would have to fall short by 100,000 per day to go under 65m screenings. This is highly unlikely as the total screenings in 2022 has fallen short by more than 50,000 screenings compared to the prior year's averages only 4 times so far in November and December and not so far in December."

I got a gist about the difference in each month and gave greater weight to winter months (Dec 2021 vs. Dec 2019 and Jan 2022 vs. Jan 2021) where it was about 11-12 mil down. I balanced it down a bit because this year's differences are smaller throughout the year. Therefore, I think 9-11 mil. down is a fair estimate. I put greater significance to the numbers with greater differences because things might go wrong easier than going suddenly better, as this year is still behind more than 5 mil. down each month against 2019 even though the COVID cases decreased. Hence, only minuscule probabilities went for over 65 mil."
