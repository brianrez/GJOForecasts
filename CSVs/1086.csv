This means to me that the Iranians have decided to play hard ball with the Brits - maybe figuring they are too consumed with Brexit? Iran was to have freed 7 sailors from the tanker in mid-August - keeping the remaining 16 - who remain to satisfy the Minimum Safe Manning Certificate requirements for this vessel. This could mean that it could sail out with a reduced crew of 16 if the Iranians permitted it - which is why I still give it a one in three chance of release by Oct 31. The insurance carrier for the Stena Impero is the Swedish Club, a mutual insurer which writes the P&I in addition to the Hull and Equipment. War risk/piracy can be a covered peril - though all P&I policies are manuscripted - so every policy is different. Assuming war risk/piracy is covered - the pressure would be on the Insurer to pay the owner of the Stena Impero for the vessel. That would reduce the pressure on the UK government to keep this in the news - as the matter moves over into the area of commercial enterprise from national interest. The Iranians could then release the rest of the crew, the Owner gets made whole from the insurance, and the vessel is kept by the Iranians and re-flagged."
77713,2019-09-04T21:57:23Z,1,[62.0],[62.0],View is that the Stena impero is being used to convince domestic audience that 'the world' is against Iran and that it is being treated unfairly - retaliation for the Adrian Darya 1 [reportedly carrying oil to Syria] - the ability to use the tanker as a political tool continues to be beneficial to the Iranian government - the outside forces are no longer 'invisible' - it also allows the Iranian leaders to show their own strengths in terms of 'you take our stuff - we take yours' ... military/political gamemanship... Tactic to encourage Europe to shift their existing position - Iran wants support in its struggle to overcome [US] sanctions - which are having an economic impact as Iran desperately wants to sell its oil to foreign markets - domestic pressure on current regime is building - younger generations want continued progress - Reports that Iran was specifically targeting vessels with British crew [Iran claims UK intercepted their tanker on US orders] - with recent news that the Iranian authorities are allowing non British crew to leave but that the rest must remain indicates that they are prepared to let this play out further - Iran wants to demonstrate confidence in its strategic position throughout the region.
