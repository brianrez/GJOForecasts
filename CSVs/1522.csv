I think there is only a 5% chance that SCOTUS will not find that the statute implicates 1st amendment rights under the specific circumstances of this case. I do actually think there is a 95% chance that SCOTUS will rule that 1st amendment rights are implicated here, but that does not mean they will invalidate the statute. More likely a compromise would be reached within the current Court. They will definitely recognize his religious liberties and wax poetic about that. But they will also wax poetic about LGBTQ rights, and the rights of artists like cake designers since that is the hook the cake shop is using. To balance these rights they will likely keep the anti-discrimination statute but allow an ""out"" of sorts. My best guess is that they will make it clear that such statutes cannot apply to businesses that are not open to the public. A business that is open to the public must serve the public. They cannot refuse a customer for discriminatory reasons. The only way for the cake shop to operate legally and decline customers such as these would be to change their business model to not be open to the public. So everyone wins. The cake designer and other persons at a business whose religious beliefs are violated by such a statute are free to do several things that may be mentioned in the opinion. They can leave their job, change locations to somewhere not covered by such a statute (eg, the feds have no such anti-discrimination statute and the majority of states do not yet either), engage in the political process to repeal or amend such a statute, or the one I think is most likely to happen: close their doors to the public and be completely be appointment only (like commissioning a painting or any kind of creative work by an artist. They could invoke copyright law and possibly say that the author of any copyrightable work has the right to decline to produce such a work, but only if they are not operating as a place of public accomodation open to the public. Creative works have strong legal protections, so that combined with the religious liberties aspect and the current Court means some kind of compromise is likely)."

If a product or service is standardized for anyone who buys it, such as a box of cookies, a hotel room, a meal at a restaurant, or a bike rental, then you can't discriminate, because there is no distinction in your expressive input. However, where the product or service requires your particular skills to produce something unique and customized, as a wedding cake typically is, or demands that you provide something you normally wouldn't, then the First Amendment is implicated, and you cannot be forced to do so. I think this outcome is the only one that emerges while leaving the precedent in Hobby Lobby (protecting a business owner's religious expression as it effects business decisions) and the family of anti-discrimination cases like Heart of Atlanta Hotel and Katzenbach v. McClung fully intact (since they all involve products or services that are the same regardless of who is ordering it. I.e., there is no expression involved with providing the product or service)."

Unless I'm not reading the laws correctly, I see no statute related to a company refusing to give a particular service or not to a customer walking in the store. Currently, federal anti-discrimination laws say businesses can refuse service to any person for any reason, unless the business is discriminating against a protected class.

This too could happen, for instance if they find a Colorado Civil Rights Commission member biased. The question of two commissioners' bias came up during later part of the oral argument. To be frank, the evidence of bias was meager but considering the Court's reluctance to even take the case up, some of the Justices would perhaps be happy to remand the case, so let's put this alternative at 10 %. (3) They decide against the cake maker. Even though ""all of his cakes"" are supposedly ""custom cakes"", the couple only wanted a cake from his selection if I understood correctly. They didn't request any type of pro-gay text or symbolism that would clearly be recognised as speech. Still, I put it at only about 15 % that the Court upholds the Colorado decision. Without trying to summarize the inane hypotheticals etc. that came up during oral argument, let me just say this: Yes, Anthony Kennedy is the author of Obergefell v.

So here's a question: what if the baker had said that he wouldn't bake the cake, and gave no reason; he simply turned down the job. Would the plaintiffs have had grounds to sue? How about if the baker had said, ""Thanks, but I'd rather take that day off."" Would the plaintiffs had grounds to sue then? In other words, can the baker legally turn down the assignment for a non-religious reason or even without stating any reason at all? Is it only a crime if the baker turns down the assignment if he or she gives a religious reason for doing so? Because in that case, it probably can be framed as religious freedom issue."
