Unless operational refers to complete construction without any tests, there's no reason to think phase 4 will be operational by January 2021.

The PV should be easy, though I haven't seen any specific status updates on it. The CSP part gives me pause. Wikipedia says there's a parabolic trough component, which I don't see mentioned elsewhere; maybe it's been dropped? At any rate, troughs are a mature technology, and if it's not massively behind schedule, I wouldn't worry too much. The power tower with molten salt storage, is a combination of two fairly new technologies in terms of installed capacity. The most similar system in the US is Crescent Dunes, which has been a total debacle, and it's not like foreign firms have that much more experience either. (Note: Crescent Dunes took two months to melt the salt in the storage system). There are so many components to these systems, from the heliostats, to the power block, storage tanks, tower, receiver, cooling system, as well as all the general plumbing and electrical connections, and I don't think we've heard about any of them other than the tower and receiver. Maybe that's because they're all going well, or are just too boring, or maybe not. TL;DR - novel technologies, with shaky track record, lots of moving parts to go wrong."
