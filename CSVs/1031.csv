The message is clear: things are looking better. But the Treasury market seems to have missed the memo. Yields leapt on the day of the Pfizer vaccine, but have since fallen back, with the 30-year yield—usually supersensitive to growth prospects—lower than at the start of the month ... This unusual divergence isn’t because the bond whisperers think the vaccine doesn’t matter. It is about the Federal Reserve and inflation, or rather the lack of it. After a decade when faster growth, low unemployment and zero interest rates did nothing to spark inflation, many no longer expect even extraordinary Fed action to push up prices faster ... Inflation prospects have barely budged, despite the boost to the economy a vaccine is expected to bring. The implied inflation rate calculated by comparing yields on Treasurys and on Treasury inflation-protected securities for the five years starting in five years’ time has risen only to 1.83% from 1.81% at the end of October, still below the 1.92% reached last month, the highest since August last year ... With inflation off the agenda, investors think the Fed will stamp down hard on any rise in yields, because of the drag on growth from higher borrowing costs."" https://www.wsj.com/articles/stocks-say-covid-recovery-is-nigh-bonds-tell-a-different-story-11606572182"
