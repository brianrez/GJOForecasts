97312,2020-12-15T20:32:14Z,1,[1.0],[1.0],"For this question to be true I considered 3 scenario's that could happen: a coup, death, or voluntary resignation. The chance of an incumbent dying in office in a given year (Based on the last 20 years) is about 1,25% (50 dead leaders over 20 years and +- 200 countries) Change of a Coup in South America and the Caribbean the last 20 years was 0,8% ( 7 coups in 20 years over +-40 counties) The same change in the previous century was around 2%. Since Venezuela's situation in my opinion resembles that of Latin America counties over the whole 20th century more closely than a Latin American country in the 21st century I raise the probability of a coup from 0,8% to 1,5%, closer to the 20th century average. The change of a voluntary stepdown I consider too small to measure. Adding the percentages up gives a change of Maduro not making 1-1-2021 at 2,75%. Since there are only 15 Days left in this year this gives an probability of around 0.1%. I round this up to 1% - never ascribe zero possibility."

It is fairly unlikely that any states against Maduro will risk the Ire of the World Powers backing him.

Additionally if Biden becomes president that likelihood becomes even less likely as Trump made Maduro a main campaign topic. In relation to domestic troubles Juan Guido has lost his momentum. The citizens are tired and don't believe he will be brought down.

Normally, the economic problems associated with the global public health crisis would also increase Maduro's chance of being forced out of office, but the economic situation in Venezuela is already dire, and that is unlikely to change. There is also a very small chance that Maduro will die or have serious health problems, but he is fairly young, so that chance is not significant."

Burn rate is about one billion per year but I expect that it will increase as the pile dwindles down and providors of supplies raise prices. Aside: iran isn't helping venezuela, it's plundering what gold remains. I think he s secure for 2020. I expect him to be gone in 2021. As long as sanctions remain and the us navy intercepts drugsand shipping to Venezuela then it is just a matter of time. The 0 probability is aggressive considering I do not know exactly how much gold is in venezuela and the spending rate. As long as he has money it is like Billie Holiday sang: Money, you've got lots of friends Crowding round the door When you're gone and spending ends They don't come no more"

Sure, there are the US sanctions and the international community tends to favor Juan Guaidó, but that alone is not going to make Maduro to step down. Also, with the US elections happening this year. I really doubt Trump will send troops or anything like that."

Additionally, he is now embracing the opposition leader to team up and fight COVID. All this could change quickly, but where he has the US to easily scapegoat, especially with the botched coup attempt (even though they were unassisted by the US gov't directly), power won't be changing hands very soon."
