Additionally, the December 2021 Options for Crude oil are currently pricing a 30% implied volatility for this product. This makes me believe that Brent Crude oil is relatively likely to end above $70.00, however there is still a possibility about the price having changes over the next six months.

101273,2021-07-02T13:31:56Z,1,[65.0],[65.0],I used the annualized volatility to scale back to a volatility for Brent crude oil from Bloomberg and then attempted to simulate a random walk with for the change in price standard deviation set to the daily volatility. I attempted to also add some drift component due to mean reversion that equated to reverting back to the 1Y mean in expectation over the course of the time from now until December i.e. Y_{i+1} = Y_{i} + (long term mean - curr price)/number of days. The reason is that mean reversion is quite common for commodities such as Brent crude oil based on some research. The simulation yielded approximately a 65% chance of the cost per barrel to exceed $70.

Oil dipped majorly since covid, and has steadily been climbing since the beginning of 2020. In the US, roughly 2/3 of oil consumption comes from transportation (https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/oil-and-petroleum-products/use-of-oil.php). We might extrapolate that oil prices dipped because demand dropped as global transportation slowed during Covid. Statista documents how travel rates have dipped significantly (https://www.statista.com/statistics/564717/airline-industry-passenger-traffic-globally/). We may therefore expect them to surge as vaccination rates across the world rise, and travel returns to post-COVID levels."

It seems that the nearer dated ones are more expensive, around 74 for August expiry, than the December ones, only 71. The future seems to suggest a slightly higher than 50% chance of Brent finishing above 70, but there are two other factors to consider. One is the recent gains that my peers pointed out, which is seemingly short lives as the pricing on different dated futures contracts would imply. The other factor for consideration is the possibility of OPEC+ actions. There have already been talks about increasing production, and despite the increased demand for oil due to a reopening economy, other figures such as Fed chair Powell have suggested these price increased are temporary. These two factors seem to suggest that oil prices may start to trend down soon. Thus, my prediction is a slightly lower than 50% chance that is currently being implied in the market (not too much lower since the market is already pricing some of this information in)."

101280,2021-06-21T13:26:00Z,1,[55.0],[55.0],"We proceed by examining the delta of the Brent crude oil 70 call with expiry at 30 December 2021. We use the data at https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/CBZ21/options/dec-21 and the options calculator at https://www.optionseducation.org/toolsoptionquotes/optionscalculator. We have the following inputs: stock price = 70.14, strike price = 70, implied volatility = 31.7%, risk free interest rate is 1.45%. The calculator then tells us that the delta is 0.552. This delta is roughly the partial derivative of the call price with respect to the price of the underlying. Some people consider the delta to be a good approximation of the probability the call finishes in the money, i.e. here the probability that crude oil is at least $70 per barrel. The high-level idea is that a $1 increase in the underlying will result in a $1 * p increase in the value of the option, where p is the probability of finishing in the money, because the option needs to finish in the money to ""enjoy"" or ""receive"" that dollar increase. Since the delta is calculated to be 0.55, we estimate this probability at 55%. A better approach might be to look at deltas over time (especially since these calculations were on a Monday and might reflect some weekend idiosyncrasies). Nevertheless, I think deferring to the quant analysts who have money on the line is an okay approximation here."
