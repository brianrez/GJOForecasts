This can be seen for large data sets from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-hospitalizations and https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/us-all-key-metrics. The peaks and valleys of these graphs are fairly symmetric, at least enough to be modeling beforehand, but not so perfect that modeling will give a completely accurate answer beforehand. (Much like stock markets). Modeling the data from healthdata.gov and the two above sources from Nov and Dec 2020 shows that the current period 21 - 28 Feb is most akin to the period from 4 Nov to 10 Nov 2020. When these Nov data for admissions over the 4-11 Nov periods are summed in the healthdata.gov spreadsheet, the result is 45,500 admissions approximately. However, the overall distribution of COVID cases seems to be falling slightly more rapidly than it rose in Nov at the current time (see first two sources for examples of the distribution falling off more rapidly than it rose). In aggregate this seems to imply that the total hospitalization rate will fall below 45,000 for this week with very high likelihood."

Same 7-day rolling % shows a 2.14% reduction. Projecting this, we would be around 45K. So, it seems clear that the number of admissions will be significantly lower than the ~ 80K at the end of January. Crowd majority predicts between 45K to 60K. What could impact this trend? - Vaccination. US is strong in vaccination, ranking 3rd worldwide [2], but, based on lessons from the top country, Israel, we will have to wait some time until we see improvement in hospitalization [3]. No impact. - Tests. A high % of tests performed improve early diagnosis and treatment, reducing the need of hospitalization. Some data shows that US as average is almost 94% test rate [4] and from other sources, only 7 States are lower 50% test rate [5] but catching up quickly. No impact. - Weather. Forecasting weather is a completely different issue, but we an assume that it will not be different in February on average than January. No impact. - Gatherings. Next and probably most important one will be the Superbolw, and the precedencts could be Thanksgiving and Xmas-Year end holidays. While admissions increased at that time, the trend didn't change significantly, if anything declining slightly. We can guess that there is more optimism but, if any, only small positive impact. - Beds and ICU utilization. One can expect that the % of beds and icu utilization could have an impact in hospital admissions, so that only more severe cases are admitted when %s are high. Using same data [1] we might see some pattern as avg increase in hospitalization decreased when beds and icu utilization reached max in Nov and Dec, but a lot more analysis is needed to conclude that. Also it's interesting that 7-day rolling bed and icu is not changing much when the same rolling of admissions is increasingly negative. Slight positive impact. - Not familiar with the US health system, but a question could be if any Public Health Policy measure would have an impact in hospitalization. I could find a reference in the Biden-Harris plan to beat COVID19 [6] to ""Ensure everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected — in America receives the protection and care they deserve, and consumers are not price gouged as new drugs and therapies come to market"". Even this might be good intentioned, it can take some time to really implement it. Slight positive impact. - New variants of the virus. Probably only experience we have on this is coming from UK [7] and South Africa [8], and they are not encouraging, with very quick increases in cases between end of Dec - mid Jan. The curve is not that steep in the US [9], so it is uncertain if new variants are still to see or it was better managed than other countries. Mid increase. - COVID policies. Arguably, most effective policy at the moment is lockdown, as UK experience seems to suggest [7]. There is a tension between health and economy [10] and good figures could relax measures that slow down improvement in hospitlization. Mid increase. Too pessimistic. Let's see with the next set of data."

The wildcard is the Superbowl obviously, but judging from how Christmas played out I don't expect it to be as huge as one might expect.
