Given the complexity of such a large (rumored) adjustment, especially with a population that has become accustomed to below international market rate fuel prices, the Saudi government may wait for a few weeks to months to put in place a structured price change and assistance programs that would minimize the impact to its citizens and businesses. They may also have allowed the leaked the information, at least in part, in order to gauge the reaction of their citizens. Given the potential reasons for delaying the official announcement in the short term, I find it slightly more likely that the official announcement will come in January or beyond, however given the possibility that this plan has been in the works for longer than the news cycle has been reporting it, I think it is still entirely possible that the official announcement could come in the next week."

The consensus seems to be about 35% so more in favour of no than yes which concurs with that. The previous monarch raised prices in Dec 2015 and the crude oil price crashed in Jan 2016. The crude price seems to be the same $55 dollars a barrel type range as then but if anything there is slight increased trend. I wondered if they might do diesel alone as a political pointed but thought that would be rather trivial. Some reports are saying the 'may' do it. So there are pointers either side of my slightly no feeling so opted for the 30 - 39 range.
