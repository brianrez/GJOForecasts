Ruhani's late March tweet that Renzi will visit Iran ""in the coming months"" seems to have put a firm lid on the February Italian announcement that the visit would happen in April. The Iran run-off elections won't be completed until the end of April. No one will be able to figure out who won for a while after that, because party affiliation in Iran is sketchy at best. Let's assume that everything settles down in Iran a couple of weeks after the run-offs. That's mid-May. There are no claims of fraud. There are no surprises or blow-ups. The coast looks clear. Let's also assume that there are no government crises in Italy (note to self - Italian governments are prone to crises and tend to be short lived). How long would it take to plan a Renzi visit? Maybe 2-3 weeks could be a guess. So now we are into June. Of course, ""in the coming months"" could also mean after July 1.

Expanding my original opinion on this, I think that Italy's head of state/government is essentially the only one of the G7 who can make a near term visit, and there appears to be a significant chance that this will occur in the next 3.5 months, but without confirmation of the initial story I am inclined to keep the probability of a visit on just this side of 'No.'"

The West may want to boost the newly elected Iranians by a visit as the reformers and moderates need to prove they can open their nation to the West since most of the promises they made to the voters are not practicable by 2017. Due to the lower oil prices, bureaucratic governance, and a middling economy, this may work against them in the next election and the officials will not deliver their agenda. Whereas most of the elected officials agree on the the need for nuclear energy and a strong defense, the economic and social divisions between the elected officials may fracture the alliance. A return to hardliners is not whom the West wants to negotiate with on these issues, therefore a visit to the newly elected officials is not out of the question but not popular in the West with politicians or the public, especially with elections in the US and France and Germany with voters divided in their beliefs on how to approach the Middle East and Iran. This is more a commerce issue than a political photo opportunity and unpopular move. The West wants to open Iran and may have to do so through business before any visits are decided upon between officials."

To begin looking at Iran, it is important to consider the effects of its most recent election (http://www.vox.com/2016/3/1/11139970/iran-elections). The election results affirmed the nuclear deal, revealed a push from the Iranian people to open up more to the West, and pointed to a trend of rising moderates in Iran. These effects show a change in the norms and protocols of Iran, whose government has been traditionally been closed off to the West and viewed as ""extremist.""

Lining up head-of-state visits to celebrate the slobbering drool would make sense. I moved up on this question December 7th because of Japan, but then back down again because of the Saudi-Iran imbroglio.

France has always been one to deal with Saddam, oppose US Iraq invasion, reach out to Russia when no none else in EU will, etc and a visit to Iran to get a head start on investment opportunities and / or negotiate ISIS and Syria would fit in with that pattern.

Both France and Germany have significant FDI positions in Iran (largely in the automotive sector, as far as I can tell), but both countries will continue to be preoccupied with other matters (immigration, terrorism, economic malaise) making such a visit improbable.

The U.S. Administration needs to keep up the pressure on Iran for diplomatic/deterrence reasons as well as domestic political considerations heading into 2016 (eg, imagine what any Republican candidate could say if a leader of a US ally appears in Tehran?). France is the most likely wildcard with a desire to reshuffle the deck in Syria and the potential economic opportunities in Iran (eg, Total's interest in revitalizing/rebuilding the energy sector). Doubt there will be movement here at least until after the February Iranian elections: if the ""reformers"" win big (unlikely), the nuclear deal remains ""on track"", and other negative dynamics are reduced, then the odds here will improve.

Why? Primarily because of Iranian actions in Yemen, Syria, Iraq and other areas within their regional sphere of influence. That being said, given the economic opportunities that the nuclear deal with Iran will inevitably bring, building closer relations and eventually hosting foreign heads of state from G7 members, particularly those with tumultuous economic situations within their own countries is eventually going to happen, just, in all likelihood not before 1 July 2016.
