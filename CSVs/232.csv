The prediction markets are starting to run towards Laxalt, but the professional forecasters are still very much undecided, with Cook, Inside Elections, and Sabato all rating it as a toss-up. 538 rates it as a dead heat, giving Laxalt (R) the slightest advantage over incumbent Cortez Masto (D). The polls down the stretch are all turning up Laxalt. Anyone looking for a play-by-play account of early voting might want to check out Jon Ralston's work at the Nevada Independent. Early voting is typically not a great indicator of end results, but Ralston has earned a reputation over the years as perhaps the lone accurate reader of the tea leaves. He seemed to give Cortez Masto a better chance than most, but that was before the votes started coming in. We'll see if that holds up. In the meantime, I'm rating his one 55-45 Laxalt."

Here's my reasoning: * Democrats have won the last two Senate elections here by thin, but comfortable margins of 5% and ~2%+, the latter by the incumbent, Cortez Maston (CM) in 2016. They also won the governorship by 4% in 2018. * Biden won by a similarly thin but comfortable 2%. I think he wins by closer to 5% if you didn't temporarily have a lot of Nevada voters not living in Nevada. I'm beginning to believe we underestimate the impact of people moving, even temporarily, on closer elections. * Presumptive Republican nominee is currently Adam Laxalt, who last lost a NV statewide election by 4% (the aforementioned governorship race). One reason he lost may be that NV just leans left by about that amount today, but I think he's particularly repulsive to service industry folks due to his opposition to fair wages/overtime. It's a particularly bad look in a state where the service employee's union is so powerful and does turn out the vote."
