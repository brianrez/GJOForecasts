Given China's history of manipulating its numbers (the CCP is most likely manipulating the reported numbers of infected and dead as well) and their strong interest and culture of saving face, they will give the appearance that their GDP has only somewhat slowed down in Q1 [2]. Q2 and Q3 reports will most likely be closer in line with the actual GDP growth, but will still be exaggerated. Furthermore, the 2019-nCov affects their standing geopolitically, giving them less leverage in their trade war with the United States, emboldening Hong Kong protests, harming the Silk Road, hindering investment in Africa, and providing ample opportunities for intelligence agencies to foster dissent among the population. Manufacturers will be spooked into diversifying their supply chain to prevent future delays in case of another event like this and China will want to quell their fears through putting up a strong front. China will report a dip, but nothing dramatic that cannot be quickly overcome. Overall, China has little reason to report the actual numbers and every reason to inflate their numbers in hopes of maintaining their economic and geopolitical momentum.

Current government estimates of 6%+ annual growth for 2020 will likely remaining silent on any Q1 adjustments. We will probably have to rely on anecdotal evidence of supply chain shifts in order to infer a move away from official Q1 GDP estimates. First off - let's see if China opens for business on Monday - or tells everyone over the weekend to continue to stay home. Along those lines -when SBUX and MCD re-open - then we can guess the quarantine is effectively over, and can then get more reliable non-government estimates for Q1's attenuated growth."
