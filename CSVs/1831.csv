In August 2016, Duterte threatened to declare martial law if the country's judiciary interfered in this campaign (Time). According to the Philippine Constitution, the President must submit a report to Congress 48 hours after proclaiming martial law and Congress has the authority to revoke the proclamation (see Article VII, Section 18 in The Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines). If Duterte proclaims martial law, the question will close on option A if Congress does not revoke the proclamation within a week from the date of his proclamation.

The region-wide declaration appears driven less by necessity—the battle was limited to just one town—than wish-fulfilment. The president, whose chief achievement in office has been an anti-drug campaign that has so far killed 9,000 people, has often pondered declaring martial law. He promised to be “harsher than [Ferdinand] Marcos”, the country’s former dictator, who presided over a decade of martial law during which thousands of Filipinos were tortured, murdered and disappeared. He joked about absolving soldiers of rapes and other atrocities. And he may yet expand the declaration to cover the entire country. Congress, where Mr Duterte controls a majority, shows little interest in restraining him. At least 44 people have reportedly been killed in Marawi, but the biggest casualty could be the rule of law."

The bank expects the Philippines’ gross domestic product (GDP) growth to land near the middle of the government target range of 6.5 to 7.5 percent for 2017. Additionally, it is confident that the government can sustain economic gains such that these will be more inclusive, or be felt by a bigger segment of the population. The World Bank’s April 2017 Philippine Economic Update report forecasts a 6.9-percent GDP growth for this year and 2018. Growth is seen slightly slowing to 6.8 percent in 2019. The World Bank’s forecasts for 2018 and 2019 may be below the government’s target range of 7-8 percent from 2018 to 2022, but will continue to be among the highest globally. However, there is a caveat. World Bank Philippines lead economist Birgit Hansl told a media briefing that the lender was bullish on the Philippines given the Duterte administration’s commitment to ramp up public infrastructure spending, which is key to sustaining the country’s growth momentum through 2018 and reinforcing business and consumer confidence. Hansl noted that the implementation of the planned infrastructure projects could generate positive spillover effects for the rest of the economy, spurring additional business activity, accelerating job creation, and ultimately contributing to higher household consumption and poverty reduction. World Bank Philippines country director Mara K. Warwick had already noted that strong growth in recent years was accompanied by job generation and a declining number of people living in extreme poverty, as well as economic growth becoming “more inclusive.” Indeed, unemployment fell to a historic low of 4.7 percent in 2016 as 1.4 million net jobs were created, while poverty incidence among Filipinos dropped to 21.6 percent in 2015 from 25.2 percent in 2012, or equivalent to 1.8 million Filipinos lifted out of the poverty line during the three-year period. But not everything is rosy moving forward. As former economic planning chief Cielito Habito has pointed out in his columns in the Inquirer, there are dark clouds over the economy. He cited the rise in inflation to more than two-year highs, persistent unemployment, and slowing economic growth. Then there is the uncertainty about the global economy, particularly that of the United States given President Donald Trump’s protectionist tendencies. The crucial thing now is for Congress to pass the comprehensive tax reform program of the Duterte administration that is needed to help finance an ambitious infrastructure plan. The government intends to ramp up infrastructure spending to the tune of P8 trillion over the next five years, seeking to spur development and ease traffic congestion by building new roads, bridges, railways and airports. These projects, in turn, will generate jobs to address the unemployment problem. In the meantime, the Philippines can still bank on two growth drivers—remittances from overseas Filipinos and earnings from the BPO sector. Cash sent home by Filipinos living and working abroad reached a record $26.9 billion in 2016, up 5 percent from $25.61 billion in 2015. Last January, the figure rose 8.6 percent to $2.17 billion—the first time that cash remittances exceeded the $2-billion mark at the start of the year. Revenues from the BPO sector have been projected to overtake remittances from overseas Filipinos this year. In 2016, the industry generated over a million direct jobs and more than $20 billion in revenues. So long as the billions of dollars from overseas Filipinos continue coming in and the billions of dollars earned by BPO workers remain here, consumer spending will sustain economic growth. These will augment household consumption and ensure the continued expansion of other economic segments, among them the property and retail sectors. As it is, the economic view now should be one of guarded optimism."""

""Our goal with this complaint is to be a vehicle for Filipinos to have a voice to oppose and fight against the abuses and crimes of President Duterte,"" Alejano told a televised news conference. ""We know it's an uphill battle ... but we believe that many will support this."" The impeachment effort is the first against Duterte since he took office eight months ago. Former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo survived five such motions. Duterte has few powerful opponents and challenges against him have come from the same people. Though the allegations are serious and attract media attention, none have stuck."""

It's a fine balance, but Duterte would do well to explore both. He has it in his arsenal. The President may have made his name as a lone maverick, but he is just as strong as a coalition-builder. It's a lesser-known skill, but it has served him just as well in his political career. Duterte was popular in Davao, not just within the local government, but also among the business community, the police, women, LGBTs, and more. Running his campaign, he built support both from the provinces but also in the capital, the poor and the wealthy. And in a political masterstroke, Duterte organized his team in the same vein. Capitalists, leftists, an environmentalist and the odd celebrity — they sit alongside each other in the Cabinet. He has appointed political old-timers but also brought in fresh faces, many — finally — from Mindanao. Even without Vice President Leni Robredo, now turned opposition leader, the bench is deep."""
