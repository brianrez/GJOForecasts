Data might be a misleading with government hiring a lot of temporary census workers [2] and I have hard time to predict what the consequences of the absence of a stimulus package from the government will cause. Will certainly look closely at the numbers for September.

For one, many of those were likely temporary unemployments that have been returning to their jobs. The temporarily unemployed will likely have mostly returned to work by then, leaving more of a ""true"" unemployment number, which will still be elevated due to businesses failing during coronavirus. The other factor is that the $600 unemployment benefit has not yet been extended, and without that people who previously wanted to avoid coronavirus risk may attempt to find work. The July number was 10.2% unemployment, I think that will continue to drop but at a slower pace, leaving it pretty solidly in the 6 to 10 percent range. My ballpark number is maybe 8%-8.5% in October. I give over 10% unemployment a 9% chance because it's possible cases worsen during the winter leading to more shutdowns and unemployment increases, and I think congress will probably pass more unemployment benefits when it returns to session in September."

As people return to work this figure will reduce because some people laid off when there was complete closure will need to be rehired. However this balances against all the people furloughed and not yet laid off. So the figure could increase again later in the year. So balancing the decrease a people go back to work with the opposite, from 11pc it could easily get below 10pc in terms of the bands given before. But up to 14pc does seems somewhat possible.

It is highly doubtful that it will go down. Data thus far reveals that the rich are spending less- which in turn powers our current style of economy downward. And if you believe that giving the rich more tax breaks means they have more money to hire more workers, this may be a time that goes against that theory entirely - as people are scared and the stock market is volatile. So they hold onto more and are less likely to take big risks. Add to that all of the parents who cannot return to work - despite being asked to - because they have no child care or school or camps to take their children to while they work. So then they get fired, replaced, and left out of the work force. Most importantly, businesses are ready to reopen and doing so, but according to multiple surveys, people are not ready to go to most of them as they are not comfortable. Unless the business can support online customers and Offer curbside pickup while staying cash +, they will too sadly go under."

While the agency has noted that this result is partly due to a misclassification error, even the estimated employment rate correcting for the error (16-17%) is somewhat lower than the peak level of unemployment I had expected (around 20%). That implies to me that, assuming lockdown restrictions continue to ease, the rate should fall to around 8-10% by end October depending on whether the error is corrected in future surveys. There is some risk that the lockdown restrictions could increase due to a second wave leading to increased unemployment, however the political climate in the US does not seem supportive of any further lockdown measures."

Looking at the unemployment rates that occurred during the 2008 recession, unemployment rose, capping off at 10% in 2010 and slowly returning the natural rate.

Typically, a GDP impact of the like we will see over the coming months would result in a devastatingly high (>25%) unemployment rate. There's also a decent chance that the US lockdown extends longer than current predictions suggest and lasts well into Q3 given US deaths show little sign of slowing down. However, balanced against that is the impact of furloughing on workers who will technically not count as unemployed as a result. There may therefore be a very number of inactive Americans who don't count in the BSL numbers. With these factors in mind, I judge that the most likely outcome is between 10 and 18% (precise prediction probably around 15%)."

The USA economy is expected to bounce back violently in the 3rd quarter, any peaks in the unemployment rate would occur in the 2nd quarter, and these would be 'artificial' in nature. For example the million's of barbers, stylists, psychiatrists, bartenders and the like would are out of work because of gov't enforced social distancing rules aren't gone forever. They will bounce back quickly once the economy is reopened. But demands in the housing and heavy industry field may still be suppressed by low demands so the unemployment rates aren't immediately going to fall back under 10% so quickly. Lot's of bankruptcies will take place, and consolidation between rivals (or takeover's) to help compete in this period of uncertainty will cost the jobs of numerous employees."
