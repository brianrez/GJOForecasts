As has also been stated, this case isn't about the death penalty, but about Voir Dire, which means this case is actually about the 6th Amendment, which (among other things), guarantees Americans the right to an impartial jury [1]. This is important because at least one justice, Gorsuch, claims to be a textualist. Justice Gorsuch has ruled on Voir Dire before, but, only insofar as how attorney's conduct Voir Dire, not how judges conduct Voir Dire [2]. In that case Gorsuch ruled against the defendants claims that his attorney did not conduct a thorough enough Voir Dire because the judge conducted a very thorough Voir Dire. In this case, the appellate court found that the judge did not conduct a thorough Voir Dire."

I couldn't find good comparisons for this in recent cases (would love to hear any), so it's tempting to rely on the general opinion the justices seem to have on the death penalty as a proxy for how high their threshold will be. That might settle 3 liberal and 4 conservative votes, while Kavanaugh and Roberts have sometimes offered lower thresholds for postponing pending executions than their conservative counterparts, so I'm starting from 4/7 in favour of overturning. Quite some of the amicus curiae briefs side with Tsarnaev though, so I find it hard to firmly come down on either side."
