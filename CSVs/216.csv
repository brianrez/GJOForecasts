However, RU police are pretty adept at dishing out enough violence to deter people but not enough to create martyrs. The 15% chance is of demonstrations reaching boiling point and a general sense of imminent collapse from the regime resulting in a sudden change of policing/suppression policy a la Tiananmen Sq. Given that tens of thousands of Russians are fleeing the country as they see no future in it, it seems that some of those most motivated to fight the regime are choosing to leave rather than resist. It seems then less likely that critical pressure will build, esp. since RU seem keen to negotiate due to military failure of operation and weight of sanctions.

The second problem, already mentioned by other forecasters, is the trouble with verifying any fatalities. This will hinge on what the GJP considers credible evidence. Again, I can see a few or several people dying in a protest skirmish, but not ten. Will there be more than one clash?"

I would expect any extended or large anti-government protest to be cracked down on hard and reach the 10+ body count quickly. (I am a little worried about people ""Disappearing"" into cells forever rather than reported deaths for purposes of counting in this questions.)"

102121,2022-03-04T18:43:47Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"There have already been protests and conditions are likely to deteriorate further within the timeline of this question, so it seems reasonable to expect more protests to take place. The Russian government has made clear that they will act to prevent and stop any protests, so unfortunately it seems reasonable to also expect law enforcement to escalate in their abuse. Off the top of my (ignorant) head, I cannot think of any protests under Putin that have led to official deaths. The playbook seems to be mass arrests and what happens behind closed bars stays behind closed bars. There is an example that predates Putin, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novocherkassk_massacre, but it took 30 years for it to be disclosed. For this reason, while I think that lethal violence may be deployed by Russian law enforcement if protests continue and intensify, I am not sure whether it will resolve the question because we may not have proof that satisfies the question by August 4th. However, there is a possibility that things will get to a point where some law enforcement agent decides to just drive into protestors, fire a gun, and so on... which if caught on camera might resolve the question."
