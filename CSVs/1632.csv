The U.S. House of Representatives is considering a bill that would allow U.S. regulators to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles a year per manufacturer from these rules. Proponents say it would liberate innovation for self-driving vehicles. Opponents say that 100,000 vehicles per year, multiplied by up to 30 autonomous vehicle developers, would constitute full deployment without the requisite safety precautions. Confused?
