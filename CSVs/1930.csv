April was the month with the lowest fatalities recorded (and still could be adjusted) with 52. Using 52 as a low prediction and forcasting it out for 7 months, it would be approximately 364. This would be on the low end of the fatalities in this 2nd prediction section. If we forcasted out the highest of the year thus far, March with 119 fatalities, it would then be 833. This would make one think the probability is largely within the 350-750 inclusive bracket. If we look further at historical data, each year has seen at least one spike between 298-560 fatalities in one month since 2012. Additionally, if we exclude these spikes, than the average deaths per month is approximately 119. With the contentious election decisions imminent, even taking a modest average of deaths per month, and not factoring in a spike, it still appears highly possible that there will be over 750+ fatalities. I have increased the percentage in the 750+ because of the trend of spikes in fatalities and the current election issues."

Amongst the biggest militias are the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) and the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF). The army of the DR Congo and MONUSCO conducted succesful operations against both militias in 2015 and their strength has been reduced significantly. In 2015 the ADF still killed at least 130 civilians. Disarmament, Demobilization, Repatriation, Reintegration and Resettlement (DDRRR) Programs are ongoing and since 2002 around 10.000 FDLR-members laid down their weapons. The UN estimates that only 1.000-1.500 remained. Both militias nontheless continue to attack civlians."
