Some of these cases seem to have been put to the ICU afterwards, as the number of ""ICU Beds for COVID-19"" have inclined more sharply after 02 July 2020 than before (723 on 01 July 2020; 741 on 02 July 2020; 796 on 03 July 2020; 821 on 04 July 2020). This is maybe a replication of the observation from Texas medical system, where patients come to see a doctor first very (almost too) late, when symptoms and lack of oxigen have become harmful and ICU treatment is mandatory. As a consequence, the relation of ICU Beds (COVID-19)/ED patients (COVID-19) seems to increase over time, which suggests increasingly scarce ICU beds. As the number of ""Intubations Performed for Respiratory Distress"" have been about 60 per day on average between 20 June 2020 and 02 July 2020, I'd say on 03/04 July 2020 alone there have been more than 90 additional (above average) intubations, which will block an ICU bed in the short term, as the recovery from COVID-19 will take at least two weeks, once an intubation has become necessary. If this trend in intubations continues, it will be ever harder to discharge patients from ICU beds soon. Even when the number of ""COVID-19 Patients Discharged from the hospital"" is rising (which also just reflects the increase in ""Inpatient COVID-19 patients""), my guess is the discharge which has peaked on 04 July 2020 may not be enough to keep patients from being stuck to 95% (or rather 96%) of ICU beds very soon. And even if 02 July 2020 has been a specifically bad day with about 4,4k new confirmed cases, 05 July 2020 with about 3,5k new cases has not been much better, and positivity rate seems to be quite constant right now."

My guess is they won't want to frighten the public by saying beds are full. Although it might trigger additional funding to have capacity filled to a certain level.

Inpatient beds usage is showing the same seven day pattern and there we can see how the number of beds used is actually going down from the 23rd to the 30th.

It is likely the fail of Arizona officials to report new hospitalisations on a broad front. The number of current hospitalizations has remained just above 4,240 since Thursday, 18 June 2020, when at the same time the number of cumulative cases has increased by ~ 30%. Very unlikely, this increase of this magnitude would not feed into hospitals as new ICU beds occupied by at least 5 to 10% of new cases (in sum up to almost 1,500 hospitalizations lagged behind in reporting). Once they pick up reporting, and publish their late reports, the 5% barrier will be done pretty immediately. If it is not today, it may be tomorrow."

If we also assume no existing beds free up nor additional capacity is added, that means 5% of the total 1,665 beds is ~83 beds. Those 83 beds removed from the remaining 337 beds as of June 11th implies 254 beds would need to be used to get to the 5% level. That shows us there are still 29 additional beds available or two more days of available capacity above the 5% level. All this said, intubations arenât the same thing as ICU bed usage to my knowledge. Iâd assume ICU bed usage is slightly higher than intubations. And, the current rate of hospitalizations in Arizona appears to be increasing at this time. Additionally, it often takes quite some time for people to come out of ICU once theyâre admitted, so the rate of already utilized beds becoming available is likely to decrease. So, we could easily see those additional 29 beds used within that time frame. The only caveat Iâd like to add is that excess capacity being added is a game changer. Makeshift hospitals can be made or regular rooms can be converted into ICU rooms. And, since the existing total beds has increased over time on the graph discussed, itâs clear that is taken into consideration. Itâs cutting it extremely tight. But, Arizona sees the current need and believes it is going to get worse. Therefore, theyâre likely to increase the number of ICU beds during this time period, especially since they told hospitals to activate emergency plans on June 8th. I believe itâll be just prior to or just after the initial cut off date, but will go with prior to based on the above as I believe rates will increase faster than the rate of increased ICU beds."

Additionally, Memorial Day weekend is typically a big weekend for parties and gatherings, which seemed to be the case with Lake Powell being ""sold out"" this year. Finally, because it is so hot, people tend to do a lot of things indoors in air conditioning, which I think will increase the spread. Chances are highest now because of Memorial Day weekend, the protests and the state opening up.
