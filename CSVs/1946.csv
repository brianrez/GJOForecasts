Johnson is still at 5.5% of the popular vote, but its probable that. as he clearly has no chance of winning, those who tell the polls they will vote for him, have less incentive to actually vote. I note that support for Johnson is highest in states that strongly lean towards Trump. I am assuming that in these states his supporters are on the right, but don't like Trump and those that do vote will stick to Johnson. But in states that lean strongly toward Clinton Johnson does not have much support. The question is what Johnson supporters will do in the states where Trump and Clinton are close. Interestingly, in the closest states, in the last month a small rise in the Clinton percentages seems to (more or less) match a similar drop in the Johnson percentages. Which seems to suggest that right wingers who don't like Trump would be prepared to switch to Clinton to keep Trump out."

Trump is only about 1% below the margin of error and in some polls within the margin of error. In most places the total 3rd party (forecast) vote is more than the gap between Clinton and Trump. My understanding is that the 3rd party candidates are just attracting protest votes i,e. those who do not want to vote for either Clinton or Trump. The point of a protest vote is that you don't expect your candidate to win, you just want to show that you don't like the leading candidates. The fairly high percentage of voters who tell the polls they support a 3rd party candidate shows the percentage of voters who don't want either Trump or Clinton as President. It does not indicate how much they dislike Trump or Clinton. I would suggest that most voters dislike one of the main candidates much more then they dislike the other main candidate. In the polling booth the voter faces a slightly different question to a poll, they have to decide if giving their vote to a 3rd party is likely to help one of the main party candidates become President, or if it will make no difference to who will be President. If they think it will make no difference then they will caste their protest vote for the 3rd Party. If they fear that by making a protest vote they risk allowing the worst main candidate become President they will vote for the least bad main candidate. My guess is that anywhere that poll data indicates that Trump and Clinton are within 4% of each other most of the votes for 3rd party candidates will be transferred to Trump and Clinton."

This means that his poll-predicted result is in the 4-10 percent range. If his result is equally likely to be at any point in that range (what the statisticians call uniform distribution), the probability that he will get at least 5 percent is 5/6 or roughly 83 percent. However, I think the distribution of his chances is not uniform, but more like bell-shaped around 7 percent, albeit with fat tails. Why this may be so: - he is consistently polling above 5 percent (in fact, in the 6-8 percent range); - Nate Silver gives him about 6-6.3 percent (http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo#plus) - with Trump losing support, and doing his best to depress Clinton's support, chances are pretty good that this year the third-party vote would not decline in the last moment as it usually does. Moreover, the presidential elections is shaping not to be too close. This reduces the pull toward the candidates of the two largest parties - people are less worried about ""wasting"" their vote on a third-party candidate and more likely to use such a vote to protest against the unpopular Trump and Clinton."

There will be Republicans that will remember and not be able to abide by his record, comments and contributions, just as there will Democrats unable to accept the usurpation of the nomination of Bernie - (that is how they see it) and thus so conflicted by party loyalty and party conduct that they vote for their conscious instead.

It seems fairly unlikely that many Democrats will suddenly become Libertarians, so it would require that around 8% of Republicans would decide that Libertarian was better than Trump. It seems possible that 1 Republican in 12 could think that almost anyone would be better than Trump, but these non_Trump republicans could not bother to vote at all, vote for Clinton (as the lesser of two evils), or vote for a 3rd party candidate. In some states it seems they could vote for Johnson or McMullin. Neither of them have any realistic chance of winning, so voting for either would count as a protest vote. If I supported a big political party that put up a candidate that I strongly did not like and I wished to register a protest vote, I would prefer to vote for a candidate that had views that seemed to me to match those that I would want my party to have. So a Republican making an anti-Trump protest is more likely to vote for McMullin than Johnson. But McMullin will not be on the ballot everywhere. So putting some numbers down: assume 50% of voters are generally Republican, but assume that many would not vote for Trump. Of those who would not vote for Trump assume that 20% don't vote for any candidate, 20% switch to Clinton, 30% vote for Johnson and 30% vote for McMullin. In order for Johnson to get 5% of the total vote he would need to 4% more of the votes than he got in 2012. This means 8% more of Republican votes, which if he is getting 30% of the Republican protest votes would mean that mean that the total anti-Trump vote by Republicans would need to be around 25% of the total Republican supporters. For McMullin to get 5% of the total vote would mean picking up 10% of republican voter's support, to get that would require that the Anti-Trump protest by Republicans was around 27% of Republican supporters. Its possible for a political party to lose between 25% and 27% of its votes in one election but its pretty unusual. But then we seem to be in very unusual times."

So, the distribution part above 5% of the vote is 50%+(50%-20%)/3=60% for Johnson to get votes above 5% limit. Of course, it is too early in the game. Let's check this assumption vs. common sense. Johnson is not Ross Perot, he appeals to much narrow audience. In 2012 he collected 1% of the vote. But the other two candidates are quite unpopular and Gary Johnson can collect protest vote. It is hard to model the protest vote. But, who am I to argue with Nate Silver? This election is very unusual... And I do not pretend to know The Truth"

The explanation that makes the most sense to me for Johnson's extraorindarily low 1% performance in 2012 is that voters have learned from the Perot and Nader examples that a third party vote is wasted and counterproductive. The pattern of high early polling for a third party/ low actual results seems to indicate a lot af braggadocio in early polls that evaporates come November when everything is on the line. Voters may have collectively learned how to game the system. I think a 5% hurdle is high enough to warrant skepticism even in an unusual year.

In Arkansas for instance if a Libertarian passes the 3% threshold in a national election , they become a regular party - meaning that in the future they just hold a primary and proceed to the general instead of each candidate having to get 10,000 signatures a piece to run. If this is the case in (or similar in required vote percentage to campaign as a regular party) then next cycle gets extremely uncertain for regular establishment partys. I think we can judge how worried this makes the various state legislators by what kind of changes to campaign law occur between now and 2020.

If he runs, I put a 90% chance he gets at least 5% of the vote, meaning 9.9% chance. However, if he is the GOP nominee, which Predictit currently has at 74%, then I say there is at least 50% chance someone else in the GOP tries to run third party.Perhaps Ron Johnson can garner 5% on the Libertarian ticket in any case? Altogether, I'd say there is >50% chance of third party getting greater than 5%."

Thus, Trump would be running merely as a symbolic candidate and that seems unlikely to me. To spend a ton of money, and get attacked to an even greater extent from candidates on both sides - seems like something he would threaten but is very unlikely to actually follow through on. Perhaps he ""campaign"" against the GOP candidate, but without being a candidate himself. And/or perhaps he'll plan to start his own third party and claim the nomination was stolen from him and that party will be involved in 2018 elections or 2020. But it seems very unlikely that he would respond to not being the GOP nominee by running an unwinable, thankless and expensive race as a third-party candidate. I also think a different third-party candidate is less likely than as perceived by many due to the ballot access issues and the fact that they would have to be assembling hundreds of thousands of signatures right now - and it does not seem that anyone is doing that. Thus, any third-party candidate will likely not be well known or have a shot at winning."

Possibilities include Kasich or a third party candidate. If Kasich is chosen the likelihood of a third party candidate is less but Republican voter unhappiness with the Republican organization may push them away and towards another candidate if available. HC is likely to win the nomination for her party and appears to have a free pass on the FBI investigation, so a number of Democratic voters may be equally unhappy with that situation and be interested in a third party candidate.

Some will stay with the ticket because the major alternative is too ghastly to be risked. Others will go to the sidelines. But, having been energized by the possibility of ""making a difference,"" the rest will look down the ballot. Threatening them with a ""wasted vote"" (circa 1992 and 2000) won't bring them back into the fold, as the establishment has been deemed corrupt from the beginning. The Libertarians have already qualified to be down-ballot in all 50 states. Given the foul mood of the electorate, 2016 will almost certainly be a banner year for them. But not so much for Mr. Trump, should he fail to capture the Republican nomination. The kind of organization required to get on the ballot nationwide, starting in July, is beyond his reach. Instead, he'd need to co-opt a preexisting organization, preferably one in search of a headliner. Pigs with wings are more likely to exist."

If he doesn't get nomination I can see him running as a third party, but I can't see him getting on many states ballots which I think would limit his ability to get to 5%. Getting on ballot and then running as a 3rd party require internal organizational and political skills, and I would imagine the R's doing all they could to prevent ballot access to him, by challenging every signature he gets. Political parties over the years have designed institutional challenges to third parties to protect their status quo."

He has a solid voter base of around 30% of republicans. But right now the chances are high that Trump gets the nomination. A third-party option would destroy the GO. Therefore they will stick with Trump. The “Trump”-issue will then resolve itself. He has little chance against the democratic nominee and by losing the election he also loses his winner image. On the democratic side, Sander supporters may not vote for Hillary, especially in deep blue or red states. There votes could go to Sanders, the green party or maybe even Trump."

I'll give ""someone else"" a 20% chance as well, as it seems quite possible that a major third-party conservative candidate will run if Trump wins the nomination."
