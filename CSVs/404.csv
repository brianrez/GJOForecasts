Secondly is the market volatility across crypto, meaning Amazon would need to implement an elaborate hedging strategy to ensure it does not lose money on violent swings. Amazons current currency hedging strategy is to not, so I do not believe crypto fits into the business model. Finally, what is the upside of this? Amazon is customer first, so what real value is this driving? I do not see any personally, as I see crypto as more of a speculation investment vehicle at present, rather than something with utility."

The question is specifically about when Amazon will begin to accept any cryptocurrency, not just announce that it will accept, or anything similar. This is quite constraining because Amazon would most likely want to deploy its own cryptocurrency solution, whether that is something that plus into an existing cryptocurrency (e.g. an Ethereum token or similar) or an entirely new cryptocurrency. In both cases, Amazon would have to announce that they are working on this in some way, if only by recruiting people for this project. (This assumes that their internal workforce is not enough to achieve this and that they have not recruited a significant amount of people to work on this without significant rumours spreading.) Then there could be regulatory hurdles to go through, as did Libra/Diem, which would not resolve by the end of September."

I mean, why would you take payment in a form that could lose >40% of its value over the next 3 weeks, as it did just this past May? One could say, well, amazon would just have to hold cryptocurrency and have blind faith that it will always rise in value, but currency investing is not amazon's core business.

For that they are at the moment way to volatile and furthermore too unregulated. Cryptocurrencies seem to me (at the moment) more like a means of speculation than a viable method of purchasing and selling everyday goods and services. But the bigger objection against introducing cryptocurrencies as payment method anytime soon is actually it's unregulated nature for the moment. The legislative process of working out a regulatory framework and probably some court rulings how regulation is to be interpreted and applied will take some time. Until that cryptocurrencies are basically Wild West. Furthermore there is talk among politicians, bureaucrats and the public of harsher big tech regulation, so in a climate like that doesn't seem like a good idea to engage in something, which might be targeted with something like the kind of Operation Choke Point. About the hiring of crypto and blockchain developers, I think this is (for the moment) more to explore opportuneties for the future and to have the specialists right at hand when crypto becomes the real deal, but it doesn't seem to me, that crypto payment is on verge of introduction at major player like Amazon within the next twelfe months. I would actually say that Amazon is not really right company to look at when it comes to observe the development of crypto payments for the mass market, I think companies like Visa or Mastercard are much better suited to watch this development. But this is just a thought which occured to while writing this here, but still might be a valuable input for somebody else here."

Tesla did succeed in (temporarily) accepting cryptocurrency payments, which demonstrates that it is possible for a business to do so. Facebook, however, faced a lot of pressure upon announcing Libra in 2019 and has essentially backed down against it. This involved Facebook creating and controlling (with others) their own cryptocurrency, which is a level above simply accepting cryptocurrency payments. However, the reason for this was to control the currency itself and be able to rely on a stable cryptocurrency that Facebook could actually trust to be stable (unlike e.g., Tether). If Amazon only wishes to accept cryptocurrency payments, in any form of cryptocurrency, then they could do so before October 2022. However, if they wish to have more control over the cryptocurrency that they accept (like Facebook did) then this may not happen until after 2022."
