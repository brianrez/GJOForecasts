Although all countries share the same peninsula, their domestic and foreign policy goals differ greatly, especially the foreign policy of Qatar. The current row can be traced back to the mid-90's when Qatar launched Al-Jazeera, which began to increasingly cover news in the Arab world, putting the regions issues on the world spotlight and much to the annoyance of its gulf neighbors. In addition, with the rise of the Arab Spring and new conflicts, Qatar has been accused of sending aid to groups at odds with its gulf neighbors, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The current standoff has also forced Qatar to make better ties with Iran, which is strategically and economically viable, as Qatar and Iran share gas fields. However, this alliance is unacceptable to the other Arab powers. In addition, Turkey and Russia have also voiced their support for Qatar, which are two countries with different goals in the region. It has also been interpreted that Saudi Arabia and the other Arab countries are able to double down on the standoff, as the US has sent mixed messages and Trump's condemnation of Qatar for financing terrorist groups is emboldening other Arab countries in their standoff. Finally, Saudi Arabia is making heavy demands such as the closure of Al-Jazeera and severing ties with Iran as a prerequisite for ties to be normalized, which may be too costly for Qatar to accept."

Adding to the unlikelihood of a truce is the possibility that Saudi Arabia is utilizing diversionary strategies while Qatar is most likely operating on the realist principle of balancing. Saudi Arabia is arguably targeting Qatar due to popular opposition to MBS’ “liberal” policies and to balance Iran by strengthening GCC and alienating Qatar, while Qatar is balancing against Saudi Arabia by aligning with Iran."

Ending the blockade without any concessions from Qatar side would be a loss of face for the saudi king. Therefore it seems unlikely to come any time soon. On the other hand there seems not to be too much to gain from extending the blockae on GCC side. It seems to foster the relationship Quatar to Iran, which is an argument for GCC to end the blockade rather sooner than later. All in all i expect the blockade not to exceed the 1 year mark"

Qatar has, at this point, established core water routes to deliver consumables to the kingdom, and derives too great a percentage of its national revenues from its rights to the South Pars field to put its economic cooperation with Tehran at risk. Moreover, there are shared infrastructure advantages to working with Iran to transport natural gas out of those fields than to development standalone infrastructure within Qatar to do so on its own. WIth regard to the continued operation of al Jazeera, it is likely Qatar would be willing to make it into a sacrificial lamb and shut it down, but given that it has already made the offer to KSA with the condition that KSA leave their existing relationship with Iran in place, and KSA refused, they no longer have much to gain by shutting it down without also making a decision on the Iranian relationship. Given they have chosen to prioritize their relationship with Iran out of economic interests, and that they are no longer looking at shutting al Jazeera down, it is unlikely KSA will agree to re-establish normal economic traffic across Qatar's land border in the foreseeable future. I assign it a rough 1 in 10 chance that a random event could cause Riyadh to change their minds prior to August."

During the summit, Saudi Arabia announced a new military and economic partnership with the UAE consequently weakening the GCC and perhaps any diplomatic gravitas it might hold to resolve the Qatar issue. The land blockade has not been effective as Qatar's other allies have relieved most of any economic stress that the land blockade with Saudi Arabia has caused. There are still underlying issues of corruption and palace intrigue within the ruling family surrounding the kidnapping of Khalifa bin Fahed bin Mohammed Al Thani's brother, a popular royal and critic of the Emir. There is still suspicion, justified or not, that the Emir was complicit in the kidnapping from the onset. Coupled with the fact that 1b in random was paid to jihadist groups for their release adds exponentially to the climate of distrust harbored by not only parts of the Qatari royal family but Sunni Arabs in the GCC as well. If anything there will be increased aggression and isolation of Qatar within the GCC. If the land blockade ends it will sooner be due to a coup by Saudi Arabia and the UAE rather than any diplomatic resolution."
