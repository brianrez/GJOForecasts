Because they believe that the sooner these elections take place the sooner Donetsk will be recognized as a separate entity and thus be able to split from the Ukraine, they are pushing these elections hard. However, Russia, who was the only country backing these elections, put out a statement claiming that they don’t think these elections will happen, implying a very low likelihood of these occurring before May 1. If these elections do end up happening, there is barely any chance that they will be recognized by other governments as the only countries to recognize Donetsk as a separate state are Russia and the Ukraine itself (who view them as a terrorist state and thus wouldn’t back these elections)."

These are really big names for Russia to drop into the conflict. This *might* increase the chance of organizing elections in Donetsk - past experience (in Crimea, as well as in occupied Donetsk and Luhansk) has shown that elections (that lack full democratic scrutiny or process) can be organized fairly quickly - moreover, the elections to the ""parliaments"" of the two ""people's republics"" in Donetsk and Luhansk held in late 2014 did not involve the participation of ""traditional"" or pre-existing parties, only rather more nebulous factions. (This approach has also been seen, to various degrees, in other Russian-sponsored statelets - notably Transnistria, and to an extent Abkhazia.), so there can be expected to be much informality in practice."
