Given this scenario, I think Lula's candidacy will be revoke and the Worker's Party will have no option but to nominate a new candidate (and hope they will be able to surf on Lula's wave).

I have revised my forecast only because some conditional probablities are starting to show up in Brazil media that don't reach many in this community in US, EU, which could help increase the probability of a 'political solution' that could be negotiated and allow Lula to run. Then too, one might recast this question incorporating the possibility that the PT (Workers Party) will nominate Lula, but for the purpose of having the nomination-candidacy ruled illegal. There is nobody, but nobody in the PT who would want to run as a stand in for Lula. It would be an embarassment to the already tarnished pride of the party, and offer no upside to the career of whoever would be enough of a schlamiel to go for it."

In that sense, I believe that they will try to hold this narrative until the very close to August when the official election starts and the candidates are officially announced, or even close to the elections itself, and they would likely try to either invite Ciro Gomes to be their official candidate or launch a strong man in the party. Briefly, I think it's very unlikely (10 to 15% chance) that the PT will go on in their first elections without a valid candidate as they know that the Electoral Court will not accept Lula's candidacy or even election as it would represent a very negative decision with strong repercussion about the weakness of the institution."
