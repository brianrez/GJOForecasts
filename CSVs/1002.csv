America and the Taliban are due to sign a peace deal on February 29th after fighting one another for more than 18 years. It has been previewed by a week-long “reduction in violence” to show both sides are serious. Each seems to be sticking to it. Clashes appear to have fallen by around 90%. If that continues, the signing will go ahead in Qatar. Under the agreement, America will quickly reduce its troops in Afghanistan, from 12,000 to about 8,600. The Taliban will promise not to shelter terrorists and to begin negotiations with the Afghan government and other powerbrokers on how Afghanistan should be run. Further American troop reductions are expected if the deal holds. Forging a political agreement will be difficult. Whatever happens next, Afghans welcome the current respite.”"

But that is not the end of the peace process, meaning intra-Afghan talks will start after the U.S.-Taliban deal signing, which skeptics of the Trump administration's peace efforts have said will be the most difficult part. It's also the most critical, Afghan political analyst Haroun Mir and others say, because peace won't happen without political reconciliation in Afghanistan (which means going through heavy negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban and be able to make mutual concessions). There are many challenges to address, such as whether the Taliban leaders negotiating in Doha can keep all the elements of their group in line once a deal is in place. Additionally, it remained unclear who would represent Kabul at the intra-Afghan talks. The Taliban have refused to talk to Ghani’s government and also denounced the election results, saying they will talk to government representatives only as ordinary Afghans, not as officials. Germany and Norway have both offered to host the all-Afghan talks, but no venue has been set. Pompeo did not say who would represent Kabul, only that talks “will build on this fundamental step to deliver a comprehensive and permanent cease-fire and the future political road map for Afghanistan.” https://thehill.com/policy/defense/484149-five-things-to-know-about-emerging-us-taliban-peace-deal https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/02/pact-taliban-reducing-violence-start-saturday-200221094340829.html https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/no-guarantees-afghan-women-draft-u-s-taliban-deal-n1140471 https://apnews.com/62c7a74076796c180677d0826a5da506"

The difference has occupied American and Taliban negotiators for weeks as they close in on a deal to end the war in Afghanistan. Taliban leaders, unwilling to signal their fight was over, refused a complete ceasefire. Yet America and its Afghan allies demanded that the militants show they are serious about trying for peace. A compromise, due to begin in the next few days, is a seven-day decline in hostilities. If violence falls significantly, the adversaries will sign a deal by the end of this month setting out an eventual withdrawal of American troops. Talks between the Taliban and Afghan politicians on how to run the country will then begin. Will the truce last? This appears to be an important development in Afghanistan’s long search for peace. But Western officials admit they are nervous, as well as excited.”"

If the Taliban spokesperson is saying that a deal is close, the likelihood of a deal is much higher than if solely the United States stated that it was close. The fact that the US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the deal also reinforces the likelihood of a deal being formalized.

Moreover, the news of a potential agreement comes despite continued attacks by the Taliban, and “The Pentagon chief said if the process goes forward there would be continuous evaluation of any violence.” Just as the agreement entails the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the Taliban’s claim to suspend any attack on the West, and a seven day “reduction in violence”, it is important to note talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government, and how their relationship influences how the United States responds to peace negotiations moving forward, in addition to President Trump’s reelection strategies."

Although President Trump emphasized ending the US longest war with Afghanistan and continuing peace talks with the Taliban, “On Tuesday, the Taliban accused the US of hampering the peace negotiations after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said ‘demonstrable evidence’ of a reduction in violence was necessary, Reuters News Agency reported”.

It is an example of an infidel nation involving itself in the affairs of the world ummah-- and that is simply unacceptable. I do not see room in this worldview for the type of compromise that would be necessary to reach any type of peace agreement with someone they view as their mortal adversary. The Taliban has now been at odds with the US for decades. Why would anything change now? These types of groups are masters of the long game and are content with waiting for years until their window of advantage opens up.

However, Trump keeps withdrawing troops without any concessions from the Taliban. On one hand, this weakens America's hand in negotiations, but it also leaves the US with little to lose in reaching an agreement."

(The continued attacks by the Taliban indicate that they certainly don't all feel the pressure to have a peace agreement anytime soon.) As far as I can tell, these power centers all cancel out. 3) ""Sign a peace agreement"" is a big threshold requiring a specific action within a short amount of time."
