I believe neither will have significant effect on the process. One outcome is the Pmd and President agree on a slate of ministers and another outcome is that PMd withdraws from forming a government.

Lebanon has three factors for forming the current government - pending debt payments, French political involvement, and post explosion corruption charges. All point to a significant delay in forming a government. French's involvement is to avoid religiously affiliated political parties from participating in a caretaker government. Absolutely no indication that will be achievable or supported by a parliamentary vote. Debt payments were defaulted in March 2020. I have been unable to find when the next payment is due, however IMF has suspended negotiations on a debt payment since July due to unsatisfactory progress and now without a government to negotiate with there will be no progress. This could be a driver for getting a government formed, however meeting IMF demands to relieve debt payment - most likely ending a large number of subsidies - will likely not be supported by the citizens or parliament. The recent explosion has resulted in the arrest of 25 officials however no investigation results have been released and protests indicate citizens continue to demand change to historic political system that allowed mismanagement to reach point of the devastating explosion. The next election is not scheduled until 2022, but an early election could be called.
