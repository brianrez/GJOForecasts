Seeing some late weakness in polls, but probably landing in 33% range? About where they started... “In May Austria’s government collapsed in spectacular fashion when a leaked video emerged, dating from 2017, showing Heinz-Christian Strache, vice-chancellor and leader of the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), promising state contracts to a woman posing as the niece of a Russian oligarch. It seemed to vindicate the warnings of those who disliked the decision of Sebastian Kurz, leader of the centre-right People’s Party (ÖVP), to invite the FPÖ into his coalition government. Yet when Austria returns to the polls on Sunday, not only is Mr Kurz set for a clear victory, he may resume where he left off with the FPÖ. The 33-year-old remains Austria’s most popular party leader by far, retaining his reputation as an energetic reformist; meanwhile, the FPÖ’s base has rallied around since the Strache scandal. Yet this would hardly be a recipe for stability. The FPÖ has blown up every single past Austrian coalition to which it has belonged.“"
