The question is, will rates be further cut at the April FOMC meeting? South Korea can be used as a case study to analyze how a democratic, wealthy country deals with COVID-19. On February 22 South Korea recorded its first day of >200 daily infections. It took until March 9th, 17 days, for daily infections to fall under 200 cases. The US recorded its first day with >200 daily infections on March 9th. Considering the US is struggling to produce test kits and have tested only 4,385 people (0.001% of the population) according to the Atlantic as of March 9th. South Korea is testing 15,000 people a day for a total of around 200,000 (almost .5% of the population). I expect that it takes the US longer than 17 days to reduce new cases under 200 meaning that the rapid spread COVID-19 will continue into April in the US. This will hurt the economy and prompt the Fed to cut rates again. US President Donal Trump has historically pressured the Fed to cut rates to help the economy and in an election year, this pressure will only increase."

As a result, between March 18 and April 29, we will see significant disruption of economic activity. Fed will respond to the real-time economic data by cutting rates. Moreover, Trump keeps pushing Fed to cut rates aggressively. However, there are several scenarios where Fed could keep the interest rate unchanged: (1) The number of cases increases at a lower speed than expected, and therefore results in less significant impact on the economy; (2) The inflation rate rises due to shortage of supply; (3) Fed may worry they may not have sufficient monetary policy space if the rate is cut too quickly."

The US has been experiencing an approximate 10 year expansion - the longest in its history. Yet, WorldBank data since 1961 suggests expansions historically last between 1-4 years before another contraction. The recent downturn in the November jobs report (down 561,000, lowest since Feb '18), contractions in the retail, construction, and manufacturing markets, financial challenges with major corporations like Boeing and General Electric, and concerns over the long-term stability of the US-China phase I trade deal - in an ongoing trade war - there is a strong probability the US economy may contract in the next 6-12 months despite a strong stock market. Since April 2019 the Fed lowered the interest rate from 2.41% to 1.54% - three distinct drops in the last 6 months. Though it has remained mostly flat since November. I believe they will hold to their last announcement that they do not anticipate making further adjustments for the foreseeable future. However, if they do decide to move it, they will lower it to stimulate economic activity and offset recession-like activity."

One argument is that election years induce uncertainty that lowers sentiment and investment. This recent article [1] argues that election years tend to be turbulent for the stockmarket. We are also coming out of a very strong 2019, which also raises the chances for some consolidation [1]. Another argument, for what it’s worth, is that if the Fed raised rates, it is quite possible that Trump will fire Powell. The extent to which Powell feels the need to steer clear of that are uncertain however. The chances of a lower rate seem higher but that will depend on future inflation data and unemployment data."

I think same is the base case for a couple reasons. - by the April meeting, the Fed will finally be seeing the impacts of their 75bps cuts in 2019 and will probably want to wait to take further action - I’m expecting data to remain solid on the jobs and consumer front, moderate to weak on the manufacturing front, and cautious on the business investment front. Main risk to this is global uncertainty pushing down business investment and forcing the Fed to act - trade war quiets down after this most recent “non-deal” deal because both sides turn their attention towards the election"
