IPO market caps are usually way below that so immediately we should be cautious. However peeps seem crazy about the crypto lately so probably more people will want to buy it than want to sell it on the first day so probably the price goes up (at least over the first day-eventually it probably goes down again)

There are too many opinions and not enough historic information on which to attempt a 'market valuation' based on traditional methods. This article, https://cnb.cx/3dXpTg1, and the one linked by @SE_Meyer (https://bit.ly/2OPcWfI) perhaps best describe the conundrum. We may know what the market thinks (and decides) in the next 36 hours depending on how many shares are put up for sale by the current shareholders. I'd suggest that most of the institutional, startup funders and private holders will hold on to the bulk of their shares and hence trading may be thin which could well exacerbate price action to the upside. I am already wincing at what this may do to my brier score."

Confirmed by Coinbase at https://bit.ly/31Nwp2Z. For more info, see https://bit.ly/2OgqvV3 for the SEC listing. Jesse Powell of Kraken is very positive about Coinbase's direct listing (https://bloom.bg/3mgDbYs) and is planning a listing of Kraken in 2022. Powell also expects Coinbase to be valued at $100bn 'with a pop after that'. Apropos Coinbase, as it is a direct listing, no new capital will be raised, no new shares will be issued, no intermediaries are involved and only current shareholders can sell shares as there is no lockup period. So, in reality, the price of a share at listing is determined by supply and demand and the 'reference price'. The reference rice is usually determined by the company's adviser and internal transactions. See the section about IOP v DLP here https://bit.ly/3sN4b4z. Looking at Coinbase's Mission Statement (https://bit.ly/3sNXHSR ) and the first paragraph of the company's website; ""We are building the cryptoeconomy â€“ a more fair, accessible, efficient, and transparent financial system enabled by crypto."" and what is often held the views about the traditional financial structures and markets in the crypto sphere, it is not surprising that Coinbase has chosen the DLP route. Coinbase will list 114.85m Class A shares at a maximum aggregate offering of $943m according to the SEC listing (https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001679788/cbfab060-8271-48dc-a12e-54b7416a71f9.pdf).

However, the boom cycle could be short lived, and its end, if caught on the wrong foot, could cause Coinbase to scrap IPO/direct listing plans this year altogether. Other very large IPOs of fast growing so called FinTechs, such as Ant Financial, have been stopped in the eleventh hour spectacularly for regulatory reasons (although, in the Ant Financial, affiliate to Alibaba, there were other more political reasons linked to domestic Chinese efforts to publicize private wealth and corporations...), and unless Crypto currencies become even more mainstream via e.g. publicly traded ETFs, it will be hard to convince the SEC of a viable long-term sustainable business model. The SEC will have to think twice to prevent themselves from falling for the line of another big Ponzi scheme that could potentially burn dozens of billions of USD in saving account capital of the size of the Madoff scandal, where the SEC was accused of doing a poor job. Thus, a significant risk of not happening. According to their S-1 form registration to the SEC, Coinbase doesn't even have a headquarter or post address, pretty unlikely for a potentially three digit billion USD company.

While much details of the IPO are not available yet, all sources indicate the market cap of Coinbase will exceed $100 billion which is less than 100 times 2020 sales. Recently, many story stocks, such as Snowflake, Airbnb and a few others have doubled, tripled or even quadrupled their market cap on the first day of trading. Unless the cryptocurrency markets totally collapse by the time the stock starts trading, Coinbase will be richly valued. If the crypto markets collapse, all bets are off but that is unlikely to happen in the near future.
