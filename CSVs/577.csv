The only movement in the polls in the last month seems to be a slight reduction in support for the SNP on the constitutioncy, and a large shift towards the greens on the all important list. Furthermore I am still confident that SNP supporters will turn out slightly less on the day. In part due to a lack of enthusiasm for an increasingly lackluster government (for many independence is the only motivation to still vote for them) but also due to the historical turn out trends amongst the demographics which the SNP gets most of its support. Going by the granularity of the polling it seems that the most motivated by the independence issue isn't young Independence supporters, it's old supporters of the Union. Therefore the increased talk of another ref may have a greater positive impact on those voting for unionist parties than it does amongst much of the SNP vote base."

Were Alba to gain 7% of the vote, the losers would be the Conservatives, Labour and Greens leaving the SNP seat count unchanged. Most of the reporting on the polls appear to concentrate on the resultant referendum/independence majority, rather than the SNP seats. Polling suggests a narrow majority (65-70)or falling short by one seat. 65 required for a majority. The popularity of Salmond, after the recent criminal and civil trials plus the various enquiries, may be in question, but Alba has seen some six significant crossovers from the SNP. Scotland has a constituency and regional political voting system of some complexity that adds proportional representation to the mix that tends to aid minority parties if their voters are geographically widespread. Salmond appears to be gaming the system to reinforce the independence vote while maintaining his ‘thorn in the side’ to Sturgeon (SNP). If this manages to take seats of the minority parties, it could give the SNP the slender majority it requires to push forward its demand for a second referendum. Is tactical voting effective? The voters could vote for the SNP as an anti-Westminster, anti-Bexit vote, but vote No in the referendum."

The internecine conflict with Sturgeon clearly makes Salmond persona non grata in SNP circles.

I have previously held that there was no apparent opposition to Sturgeon from any other party. Ross of the Tories has been trying although he overreached pushing his vote of no confidence prior to the release of the Hamilton report. Sarwar, the new Labour leader appears to be showing signs of a calculating cool head. So, perhaps there is opposition sufficient now to take some votes from Sturgeon, albeit the Scottish alternative voting system tends to make it harder for any party to shine through, as we have seen from the cobbled together coalitions that have kep the SNP in office for 14 years."

It took 7 months-ish—plus or minus—to go from 50 and reach a peak, then begin falling again. It started falling almost 7 months ago.

While it appears that the Scottish public is fairly evenly divided on the topic of independence from UK, Scottish nationalists have been the backbone of support for Sturgeon. Sturgeon has argued strongly that Scotland would be better off out of UK, independent and in the EU. This recent study from the London School of Economics suggests that costs to Scotland would be substantially more than the cost of Brexit. See https://bbc.in/3pNY4eC. This could dent Sturgeon's support across both sides of the divide.It will also raise the question again about how viable Scotland would be as an independent country and whether or not it would be feasible for Scotland to rejoin the EU. Or for that matter, with Scotland's significant deficit, if the EU would accept an application from Scotland as an independent country. Equally questions are being asked about Sturgeon's handling of the Covid situation in Scotland and her knowledge of Salmond's dalliances and if she was economic with the truth in the house. On balance, Sturgeon will, IMO, gain a majority although it may be a reduced majority."

Labor has recently experienced massive drop of in voter turn out (since 2011), when SNP took a large share of votes (50%). Worth noting, the Labor party is currently engaged in ""Open civil war"" with the most recent leader stepping down.

I do not anticipate a change in the leader Scottish Labour will result in an immediate improvement in electoral performance for the party.

There appears to be Teflon element to the Sturgeon government where the SNP is the most trusted concerning education, where there has been universal condemnation of the diminishing education system. Poverty and life expectancy in East Glasgow is also an issue for the SNP. Boris Johnson may have upset Scottish sensibilities by stating that devolution has been a disaster. By this, one assumes that the handing over limited powers to a Scottish legislature has been a mistake which, has probably reinforced independence ambitions. Therefore, the SNP will probably increase their share in the Scottish Parliament. However, there may be a future backlash when arguments are made as to the financial viability, type of currency (new countries have to join the Euro in the EU) and the English – Scottish border (consider the issues over the Eire- NI border {EU/UK} ) that independence would bring."
