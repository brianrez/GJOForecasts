With the election of Biden, who may have a more practical approach to the important relationship than his predecessor, there may be some room for upward movement in the exchange rate, but anything significant seems highly unlikely."

This is a very difficult moment in history. The pandemic has had severe impact on human life, with more than 200,000 Americans dying from COVID-19 or COVID-19 complications. The United States and the rest of the world are in times of uncertainty, which has individual citizens as well as major corporations concerned; “roughly half of all companies in the S&P 500 index have withdrawn earnings guidance, noted Donald Calcagni, chief investment officer with Mercer Advisors, and ‘the few who haven’t, are afraid to” (Riquier, 2020). The world is at a crossroads of what to do. Even with uncertainty, there is a fair amount of data for the U.S. dollar against the Chinese yuan. According to the stock and research company, Macrotrends, the U.S. dollar has had a consistent value compared to the Chinese yuan. From 2008 through the present, the exchange rate of Chinese Yuan to the U.S. Dollar has been valued, at the years close, between 6.00 to 7.00. Even with a worldwide pandemic, the data is consistent. I am 98% sure that at the end of the year, the U.S. dollar and Chinese yuan exchange rate will be between 6.00 to 7.00. The final 2% is between 7.00 to 8.00. Trading Economics. (2020). Currencies.

Por otro lado, existe una probabilidad baja de que el dolar se devalúe y el valor sea de 6 o menos, esto ya que China se encuentra liderando la búsqueda de la vacuna contra el covid en comparación con USA, entonce la creación de esta generaría una alza del valor Chino comparado con el Estadounidense. Además, China se encuentra en transición a su moneda virtual, por lo que también generaría un mayor movimiento económico y subiría el valor del Yuan.

My assumption is that China would prefer a band around 7 and above to encourage exports to keep factories busy as they recover.

On the other hand, China has a track record for administrating their currency within a bandwidth and most of the time weakening their currency (currency manipulation) verbally in order to make products more competitive on export markets. The total effect may be around zero. With a special situation of an ongoing tariff war and an unprecedented increment in US public debt, (probably) slowing growth in China's currency reserves and not least disruptions in world trade/repatriation of some production in the wake of SARS-CoV-2, the total effect on USDCNY is hard to tell. To me it depends on whether ""the West"" will continue to gather behind the US with one accord despite political tensions with the current White House administration (POTUS 45) in the future, and how hard the landing of the Chinese export oriented economic model and the distress in the Chinese financial system will turn out. My guess is (armed conflicts with Chinese involvement excluded), the CNY will further depreciate by between 5 to 10 per cent, with a final exchange rate of about 7,60 CNY per USD on 13 November 2020."
