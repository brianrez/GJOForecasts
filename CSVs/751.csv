There are currently 787 cases according to https://heyjackass.com/# which gives more and more weight to the argument of Terry-Smith. There are less than 3 days left.

In my opinion the likely range is between 2016 and 2017 looking at the chart at the Chicago Tribune.

We have 153 days remaining in 2020, from end of July. Thus, assuming steady pace of homicides, we can extrapolate to 756 for the year. Having said that, the high pace of the first 7 months of 2020 doesn't necessarily mean it will keep up the same, and could slow down (since it is a high pace, I am less inclined to believe that it could further accelerate, although it might still). A pace of 1.54 homicides per day from Aug 1st onwards is what would be required to get to 676 homicides, which is the divider between the two brackets. This is a pace that is 25% less than the pace of homicides in the year to date. I find that, while the pace can definitely get slower, it will be hard to get to something much slower (e.g. 30% or 40% slower pace). So I tend to believe that the second bracket is more plausible."

The mean for Chicago has been 675 historically, so the number will likely continue regressing toward the mean for the remainder of the year. Evidence suggests homicides increase around holidays, which we still have quite a few of this year, but those spikes are unlikely to have a notable impact on the overall count. With the federal government now taking an interest in the increasing crime rate and potentially looking to interfere, it is also unlikely the rate will continue of increase by years end. Really, its going to come down to a natural rate towards the years end, and predicting that is going to come down to historic norms, which suggest the second bucket."

Since 1985, the average murder rate in Chicago is around 25 in 100,000 residents, or about 675 homicides per year. This will serve as a historic mean. The highest rate on record is about 0.33%, or 891 homicides in a single year. At the end of June this year, Chicago was on pace for 658 murders despite a large uptick since last year, where there were a little over 500 for the entire year. As of July 29th, there were 432 murders, putting the projection at 740 for the year.
