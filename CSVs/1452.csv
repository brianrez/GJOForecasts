I considered M2 but it's a fairly linear growth. I also looked at the components of CPI but it seems to be a lot more noise. Macro trends seems to be evident (apparel and auto are down - real estate and medical continue to be positive increases). There doesn't seem to be a seasonal trend so January isn't really a thing. We also seem to be sitting right at the cusp of 1.8. The GDP and Inflation doesn't seem to have any correlation with the CPI (positive or negative). My N of 1 is basically if I feel that things I buy are cheaper or more expensive. More expensive seems to be the case but that doesn't help with spitting between the over/under at 1.8. It seems like the main driver is the perception of consumer confidence. That being said, I think retail is going to come up short over the holiday season. The question is how much does that affect January pricing of the basket of goods? IDK. so 90% chance it falls into 1.6-2.0. That more weighted between the 1.6-1.8. potentially lower and potentially higher. I think the release of November numbers will warrant an update."
