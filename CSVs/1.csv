If public consciousness of higher egg prices continues to evaporate over the month of February and demand starts to tick back up, but supply is still limited because of the length of time new hens take to start producing eggs I could see the price rising higher, but also feel prices could stabilize and continue to drop since I don't really know how accurate any of my research is.
