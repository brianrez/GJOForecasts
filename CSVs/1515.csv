Likelihood of this deal coming to fruition in terms of a meaningful transfer of administrative power from Hamas to the PA is nearly zero: -Obstacle #1: Hamas has strongly declared that it will not disband its 25,000+ strong military arm (Qassam brigade) https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/palestinians/1.818235. Huge problem for the reality of a transfer-of-power from Hamas to the PA. The PA still maintains its policy of paying pre-2007 Fatah government workers and police officers to not work for Hamas, and will have to form a new administrative government as Hamas has dissolved its ""administrative committee."" The expectations inside Gaza, however, still revolve around a power-sharing agreement (Sami Abdel-Shafi, an independent political consultant in Gaza City, says, ""In the West Bank some people are talking about a complete governmental takeover in Gaza, whereas within Hamas, the language being used is all about political power sharing."") Besides, what does Fatah-controlled administration really mean or really look like if Hamas maintains 20-25,000 soldiers inside Gaza?"

It’s important to take the outside view here--it's not the number of his visits in the past seven years but rather what is the baseline number of visits of heads of state after a major peace process or deal? This is probably pretty high (think Ireland, Columbia and FARC, any major peace process or treaty like between the US and the Soviet Union). I'd place this at 90% and higher. There are some international events that are just so big and important that heads of state have to be present, the ceremony matters a lot.
