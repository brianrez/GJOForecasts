That is roughly a 2/52 or a 1/26 chance (3.8%) this will occur in any given year. None have occurred in the last 20 years. Significant security measures are in place to prevent large-scale fatalities like these from happening since these two attacks. Many groups still possess the intent, but very few possess the capability. There were less than 20 attacks/incidents (on any location) resulting in 10+ casualties during the same time period (50+ years). Most attacks occurred at Religious Sites or schools, not federal institutions - most likely because of high security at most federal institutions. Attackers would likely choose a site with little to no security IOT achieve similar results and media coverage. Unsuccessful attempts would bring less media attention - assuming that is the goal. This could still occur but I give it a very low chance that it will happen in the next six months."

The only thing I would add is that the media tends to sensationalize these small-probability events, so the perception gets distorted and people view the probability as higher than it actually is. If someone is a federal worker they are far more likely to be killed by things like poorly-stacked materials in a supply room or chemicals used in the construction of their federal building than a terrorist. And yet what's salient in our minds is federal facilities being attacked, due to availability bias.

An attack cycle for an organized group usually takes many months. If they rush their planning and dry run cycles, they increase the likelihood of being caught. I had not considered the aspect of 10 domestic terrorists being killed, but I think that would be less likely too. Having that many people involved in the plot, such that 10 could be killed in action, would increase significantly the likelihood of an FBI informant being in the mix. To me that would decrease the likelihood of such a mass casualty event, even if just among the perpetrators."

99943,2022-08-20T19:38:48Z,2,[10.0],[10.0],"If we didn't have the FBI, I'd give this maybe 60% because of current high and rising tensions, and that's probably too low. But, much as those who would attack the FBI claim it is incompetent, dysfunctional, and corrupt, it's actually an incredible organization that has prevented countless attacks almost entirely behind the scenes. So, given their overall general competence and that they are on high alert, I'll give this about 10% for now, allowing for the possibilities that they miss something or that bureaucratic procedures get in the way of stopping something they didn't miss. People almost always talk about what they want to do, and the FBI will almost always hear it."

Something like the Oklahoma city bombing seems too large to happen today, in light of precautions put in place after 9/11. Most likely, it would probably be a shooting attack, but to have 10 fatalities would seem like a lot, given there is security at most of these buildings."
368,2022-08-20T14:16:23Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"Domestic security has been determined by the ICs to be a significant domain of US attention. Given that domestic terror has been prioritized for attention over the next decade, counter-terror assessments along with concomitant responses remain on the security radar. While domestic threats are becoming normalized by the extreme right in the US, large or small scale attacks resulting in fatalities at Federal facilities are likely benign despite the destabilizing nature of political instability. Security mechanisms within the US are sufficiently robust to counter such threats an makes events such as these highly unlikely."

Adjusting with Laplace, I assume 57% of these cases ends in casualties of 10 or more. So if there is 5 months left (converted to years) divided by the average of 2.4 years, times 50%. That's 19%. Multiply by 57% chance it's over 10 deaths. Result is 11%."
