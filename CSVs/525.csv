It’s before 1 July 21, not in 21 https://spaceflightnow.com/2021/03/02/boeings-next-starliner-test-flight-delayed-after-spacex-crew-rotation/ Test flight 2 not expected until May at earliest. Second slippage. If slips again likely to be another month so that would be June. Forecast is now all about whether this May flight happens. If it does it is likely to dock given the first test flight got the ISS and nearly docked. But if the problems are software they have to be confident. Plus they have to fit into NASA’s flight schedule which is likely to prioritise manned flights or restock flights because the astronauts on the ISS take precedence over testing I guess"

This has probably caused a diminished trust in Boeing’s capability in their haste to complete projects. NASA would like to have two functioning commercial companies to produce re-usable spacecraft with Elon Musk’s SpaceX being the other one and reduce the dependence on the Russian systems. Perhaps the competition is proving to be a disadvantage. Also, there is a pile up of dates to allow travel to the ISS due to Soyuz and SpaceX that will delay the launch of the Boeing Starliner. There is no determined date at the moment. I will therefore suggest that given NASA’s necessary risk averse nature, the date will slip beyond 1st July 2021."
