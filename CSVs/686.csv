However, these strike me as sufficiently unlikely as to be justified in rounding down their probability to 0%, rather than rounding them up to 1%. Even though this question is asking about December to January change, I would even go so far as to apply this rounded 0% estimate to the scenario that the Fed would increase it's rate from any point between my answering this question the first time (Sep 19 2020) and December 27th.
