"Between 1 October 2017 and 30 September 2018, will an armed group from Iraq engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Iraq?",2017-09-29T17:00:21Z,2018-01-01T07:59:37Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],212,654,52,237,"The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (Early Warning Project). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 31 December 2017 and will be resolved in October 2018 after EWP assesses the situation in Iraq from October 2017 through September 2018.. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilian fatalities occur in one or more campaigns. See Early Warning Project for examples. See GJ’s FAQ on forecasting questions like this. Confused?

As detailed data, listing the perpatrator, is only avaiable for <January 2017 yet, it is hard to draw definitive conclusions. Im January 2017, the Islamic State was directly responsibile for half of all killed civilians. While civilians also die as 'collateral damage' in fighting, overall it's clear that the Islamic State is perpetrating mass atrocity crimes targeting the civilian population and Shiites in particular."
