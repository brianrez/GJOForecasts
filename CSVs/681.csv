Even if middle-man Chief Justice Roberts switches over to rule for the City, that would mean a 5-4 lean on CSS's side, still. There is a chance, however, Barrett rules for City as well, making this a 5-4 on the flipside (toward ""liberal"" side / the City). There is also a chance that Barrett rules for City and Roberts stays with the ""conservatives,"" still a 5-4 in favor of CSS. Breyer is the next bet to switch over to ""conservative"" ideology. Kavanaugh is Catholic and one year was the Justice most in line with the majority decisions. Kavanaugh and Roberts generally agree. Roberts and Alito generally agree as well. Thomas seems least likely to switch; he had once aspired to become a Catholic pastor and still abides to his Catholic faith."

After listening to oral arguments I am not really any more clear about what the court is likely to do. One Justice, and I don't remember who, in the oral argument said that the court has a strict rule that they try to never make constitutional decisions if they can at all avoid it. Many justices expressed that both sides have clear rights in this case. I think they may try to do some kind of compromise which grants both sides some rights and may end up not granting the actual ruling of unconstitutionality. yes the court has a conservative majority but I'm not really sure what that means anymore. Today's conservatives tend to be pretty pro-government."

In my opinion the description below has some factual errors, but I can see conservative justices being sympathetic to this point of view. I believe the errors are that CSS believes it couldn't provide referrals because the laws require each agency to address the suitability of applicants. The city also didn't tell CSS how to interpret Catholic teaching, that's a pretty extreme framing of the facts, but again I can see a conservative court being sympathetic to a religious organization being shut out of foster care due to city requirements."
