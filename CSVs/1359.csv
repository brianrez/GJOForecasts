They've been very careful to respond in kind but also to wait until the last minute to see if Trump flip flops on his plans and doesn't go through. If the July 6 tariffs go through, I am sure China's will as well. Trump has threatened to retaliate and is probably hoping China will back down first; China doesn't need to nor seem inclined to show any form of desperation or deferential attitude toward the US or Trump, so if Trump responds and planned, I am sure China will as well even though they haven't formally announced what their relations might be. I would give Trump's chance of going through with the July 6 tariff's above 80% and China's likelihood of responding in kind 100%. However, I would expect Trump's likelihood of following through on his second round of tariffs much lower - maybe 15-25%. News flurry as July 6 approaches, etc. China has responded pretty aggressively and quickly to US threats and tariffs (US bumps tariffs but exempts China and Canada and China responds with tariffs against the US; Trump threatens $100bn and China reduces tariffs on products with other countries but not the US; Trump plans to go through with $50bn of proposed $100bn tariffs and China responds immediately with $34bn of their proposed $70bn against US imports) https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/19/how-the-us-ended-up-in-an-escalating-trade-dispute-with-china.html"

The statement, by China’s Ministry of Commerce, suggests the government is considering options other than tariffs as its tit-for-tat trade row with Washington rumbles on. ...Wei Jianguo, a former vice-minister of commerce, said the ministry’s announcement meant it was likely that Beijing would now extend the range and duration of its countermeasures. “Aircraft, chips and energy imported from the US could be subject to [punitive tariffs]” he said. “China is also likely to take action against the US service trade, including transport, tourism and education.” Wei, who is now a deputy secretary general at the Chinese Centre for International Economic Exchanges, a state-backed think tank, said Beijing might also make its countermeasures permanent rather than temporary, and if the situation worsened US firms could be excluded from China’s financial markets. A commerce ministry spokeswoman contacted by the South China Morning Post declined to comment on the statement. http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2151502/donald-trump-can-outgun-china-trade-tariffs-beijing-has http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-06/19/c_137265552.htm http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-06/19/c_137264464.htm"

China has made it clear that it will react quickly and firmly to tariffs, but that they don't really want them and are willing to reconsider if the US is willing to participate in talks and follow WTO protocols. Trump generally hates to back down, except that this really is bad news and when he is wrong or planning to hedge a bluff or aggressive move he has made, he generally lets it lay quietly for a while and then buries the decision, which he may do on the proposed tariffs after the 30 days comment period. China will lose some but not nearly as much as the US will, and although Chinese companies have made a huge deal with Boeing and seem to prefer it within the industry over Airbus, they are also also trying to encourage their own company to develop and expand. It is of course nowhere near ready to manage primary aircraft manufacturing in China, but China has a variety of other places it can go to expand which may be cheaper (Boeing is good but expensive and slow to develop new equipment/models; it also outsources 50% of its aerospace engineering). In the end, it will probably encourage relationships in regions of the world where China is looking to expand partnerships already. I suppose that leaves a lot dependent on Trump, and although he hates to do an about-face, he's done it in the past when it's clear there's not much to be achieved. He tends to stay strongest in his positions when he has a support base, and a lot of his support base isn't going to like this."

The president seems to make these threats, then finds an excuse to water them down once he finds out what the real consequences will be. He's one to bluster and threaten first, then subsequently reverses himself when he finds out what the reality will be. Reference his Steel and Aluminum tariff. He went from a staunch ""across the board"" restriction on ""all"" imports to excluding most countries that actually supply much of these metals to America. Those still under the tariffs are smaller and more inconsequential payers."
