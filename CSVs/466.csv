Based on the closeout date of this question, that gives Bitcoin a higher starting value leading off the final 60 days of the window. Additionally, name recognition gives Bitcoin a significant advantage to remain the highest value when the window closes.

The only assets that were in the green for 2021 Q2 were XRP, ADA and ETH, the native cryptocurrencies of the XRP Ledger, Cardano and Ethereum blockchains, which have continued their upward march returning 22%, 19% and 16%, respectively as reported by CoinDesk. Despite ending the quarter at a loss, BTC and ETH hit new all-time price highs earlier in the season. For bitcoin, 20% drops are common on the way to new all-time highs according to CoinDesk. However, Some analysts characterize the recent upside move in cryptocurrencies as an oversold bounce. Technically, that occurs when prices become stretched to the downside, which encourages short sellers to exit their positions. Still, several risks remain that could limit further upside. One area of concern is the effort by U.S. and European authorities to enact stricter measures for users to exchange crypto for fiat currencies. This will be an ongoing development. Based on the charts, I calculated that as of October 1, 2021 Cardano was the best performer with a 6 month return of 86.39%, followed by XRP at 77.76%. For the long term, Bitcoin and Ethereum have the most name recognition and the least speculative. My top 3 in this forecast are Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cardano, with Cardano outpacing in the short haul. @SEC.gov reports that Ripple is involved in litigation concerning an SEC complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan that charges Ripple defendants with violating the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. This litigation if successful could have long term effects on Ripple's viability."

US News Today has named 3 of the above cryptocurrency as some of the best to invest in. Both Etherium and Cardano are similar according to US News by saying ""Like Ethereum, Cardano is a decentralized blockchain platform that uses a native cryptocurrency, in this case Ada, to enable secure peer-to-peer transactions"". I think a tight race will arise between these two. Based off current market value, I don't believe that XRP(Ripple) will have a chance to be a leader of the pack between now and November 29th."
