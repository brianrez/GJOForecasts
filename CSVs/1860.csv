The armed conflict aimed at toppling Burundi's government has intensified since then (Deutsche Welle, ACLED). In the event that Nkurunziza reportedly disappears or flees the capital, Good Judgment will observe a three-week waiting period, at the end of which the question will close retroactively to the date of his disappearance or exodus. If Nkurunziza returns in the interim, the question will remain open. Recommended Questions Will Jacob Zuma cease to be president of South Africa before 1 January 2017? Will Dilma Rousseff cease to be President of Brazil before 1 January 2017? Will Recep Tayyip Erdogan cease to be President of Turkey before 1 August 2017?",https://www.gjopen.com/questions/267-when-will-pierre-nkurunziza-cease-to-be-president-of-burundi

As a result of deep poverty, Burundi is dependent on foreign aid."" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burundi#Economy Tragically, things are not much worse under Nkurunziza than they always have been, and it's hard to see how things will ever improve for the citizens of Burundi. Being small and resource poor, international concern is limited and foreign aid is well short of what it should be. A coup attempt failed in 2015 and there are no signs that one could succeed in the near future. I suppose someone with a death wish might assassinate the president - that's what we're really forecasting, I think - but I suspect most downtrodden citizens would just settle for slightly better governance from the mob they've got. There doesn't appear to be a solid enough political alternative to risk civil war. It's safer just to leave."

The incumbent president clearly did not wish to relinquish power, however, BBC and UN profiles did not portray him as an out of control mad crazed dictator, although some of his critics probably would, and, critically, not as someone who is beyond compromising [1&2]. BBC described Burundi as one of the world's poorest nations, and EU was considering to impose more sanctions following the failure of talks to end a political crisis [4]. Internal organised opposition was not considered to be strong, as evidenced by the failure of the coup and the fact that many have fled the country (did not believe that they stood a chance in overthrowing Nkurunziza ?). It appeared that although the situation was not volatile at present, a deteriorating economy will quickly stir unrest and the international community would be even more unsympathetic. Burundi was receiving aid from the EU, and although China seemed to have wanted to earn a right to play in the country, there was not much in the news of current involvement. On balance, a high probability was assigned to Nkurunziza making it beyond 2018, especially as poor economic conditions do not immediately and necessarily coalesce into successful coups. Moreover, Nkurunziza might comprise to some extend to ease tensions and get the exports going. The caveat being that forecasts beyond a year are not generally easy."
