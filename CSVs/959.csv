However, it is worth recognising that Renzi's current poll ratings are lower than when he formed his Italia Viva party a couple of years ago. So an election in the short term is unlikely to benefit him or his party. That being the scenario, what is his likely motive for removing his two ministers from the coalition and leaving Conte without a majority? More influence in the current coalition is the most likely answer. Particularly with the regard to the allocation and distribution of EU Covid recovery funds. See https://bit.ly/2Kn1MMS and https://reut.rs/3in3rPh. M5S and PD, the other two coalition parties are also not likely to benefit from a short term election. The most likely gainer from a short term election would be the right wing with Salvini, Brothers of Italy and Forza Italia. Adding to the minimal chances of a short term election has been the call by the President of the country, Sergio Mattarella, to put country before politics in the face of the current coronavirus crisis. Thus, in spite of the current turmoil in Italian politics, it is unlikely Conte will be out of office in a matter of 7 days albeit he may lose the 'vote of confidence' in the parliament and senate this coming week."

Conte can try to cobble together another coalition by giving more power to the center-left Viva Italia party, but that would be perceived as caving to the demands of a junior coalition partner that caused the current crisis because it wants to dole out more on pandemic economic relief — a move Conte rebuffed because he says it will plunge Italy further into massive debt. Conte could also seek a confidence vote in parliament and hope the far-left Five Star platform whips up more votes in favor than against. Or he could give up and ask to call an election, with the far-right Lega party ahead in national polls and poised to win a majority with its allies. The government collapse comes at a perilous moment for Italy, which is battling a surge in COVID cases after being one of the hardest-hit countries in the world back in the spring. With the economy in dire straits, more political instability is the last thing the country needs, but Conte — a technocrat appointed to his position as a compromise between the populist right and left, with no political base of his own — may be powerless to stop it."

This means that he will try to avoid his removal. In the Chamber of Deputies he would have no problem gaining trust. He would win the vote even without or against the votes of Italia Viva. The problem is in the Senate, but an attempt is being made to form a group to replace the 18 senators from Italia Viva. Both the PD and M5E have already said that they do not want Renzi (leader of Italia Viva) because ""he is not to be trusted."" Reports say that most party leaders will not push for elections in the middle of a crisis. More than 70% of Italians, according to polls, do not want early voting. Its less likely that Italia Viva will achieve his removal, from a minority."

He was seeking the backing of lawmakers for a reform of the EU’s bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). The reform, due for approval at a euro zone leaders’ meeting on December 11th, has engendered deep misgivings in the Five Star Movement (M5S), a partner in Mr Conte’s coalition. But a last-minute compromise was reached on the wording of the government’s motion and, with the M5S lagging in the polls, few of its parliamentarians are expected to rebel. Now, however, Italia Viva, a group led by Matteo Renzi, a former prime minister, is threatening to mutiny over plans for a special task force to oversee the spending of the bonanza Italy expects from the EU’s post-pandemic recovery fund. Asked if the government could fall, Mr Renzi said he hoped not, but feared it would.“"

Conte's stature, both in EU, G20 and at home appear to be on the ascendency. Conte has brought a mood of calm to Italian politics unseen for many years. His management of the Covid-19 pandemic has largely been considered good by most Italians which has also strengthened his position in the coalition. See https://bit.ly/33DGqRJ."

I am aware of conservative's in the country who are still in favour. The fact that the question allows for reappointment of Conte, after hypothetical and very Italian political upheaval, make this even less likely. The huge amount of effort from 5Star and the PD to keep Salvini out demonstrates the usefulness of a non-political actor sitting as PM and the lack of appetite for a further election, however Italian that would be. Plus Salvini, if he is to re-emerge, will need more than 6 months to rebuild."

You could say it all began on the 10th of April when he publicly accused opposition leaders Matteo Salvini and Giorgia Meloni of being liars. These accusations were met with responses comparing Conte's actions with that of a regime. However criticism of the Prime Minister is focused on a series of aspects, the most important being the economical policies adopted by the government to combat the effects of COVID-19. It has been approximately a month since most business in Italy had to close. The vast majority of these businesses were not prepared for this long of a closure and are now facing serious financial difficulties. Along with this unemployment rose to 11.6% in April from 9.8% at the end of 2019. Most of the economical tactics employed by Conte have been ineffective, they usually consisted of going on live TV and promising Italian citizens sums of money which never arrived. Conte also stated that Italy did not need to resort to the use of the European Stability Mechanism and then one week later an agreement was reached with the EU that allowed for the possibility of the ESM to be used. Now this was all done without taking into consideration what was thought of the ESM in Parliament, Conte was heavily criticized for not considering what opposition leaders had to say and above all what his own party had to say. Yes, Conte's very own political party was unsure of what to do regarding the ESM. Along with these mishaps are a serious of smaller actions which I won't describe. Now, given this context, I believe that if an election will be held it will be held on the grounds that Conte was unable to successfully protect the Italian economy. However, the coalition of left wing parties holds the majority and I see it unlikely that they will be willing to risk going to the polls. If the coalition is to break it will be precisely because of this economic tension within the government. It also has to be said that the leaders of the main EU countries see Conte's exit as Prime Minister as a threat. I believe that Italian citizens are just now starting to realize how inefficient the EU is and how one-sided it has become. This new vision, which will most likely be adopted by the next Prime Minister, threaten the stability of the EU as Italy is a large contributor of funds. Conte would be pressured by Macron and Merkel to stay because they fear that someone like Matteo Salvini would succeed him. This would mean one of two things: Italy's exit from the EU or serious renegotiation."

PD also is very well aware of its weaknesses. Conte performed surprisingly well. He was a perfect stranger, but he grew into his position and he is very well-liked. He didn't state any affiliation right now. He might eventually. Salvini is the unruly one dreaming of the big chair, however, he is showing poor judgment, and quite frankly a lot of stupidity.

Also the base rate tells us that Italian PMs don't last long and Conte has been in office for over 1.5 years already."

But given the breakdown of 5 star and the comeback of Democratic Party both have every incentive to hold on to this coalition and avoid early elections. For a new prime minister to be sworn in one needs to take into account the time to form a coalition (usually many months), the time to call new elections (including long summer break) which means for this event to happen snap elections need be called before june. Hence my below consensus forecast."
