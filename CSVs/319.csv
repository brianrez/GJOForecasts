The stock market saw gains today despite yesterday's steep loses for the Nasdaq (recovered 3/16%) and Goldman Sachs cutting the yearly outlook for the S&P. S&P closed up 2.14%, Dow up 1.82%.

According to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the AP News article the Federal Funds Rate increases in order to tempter economic growth and to cool off inflation (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System n.d.). One of the items that might prevent the Federal Fund Rate from increasing is economic uncertainty and that can currently be seen through the Ukrainian Conflict. However, Powell still states that the Federal Funds Rate will increase despite this conflict (Schneider, 2022)."

Therefore, after evaluating the inflation rate within the past couple of months it appears that that has had a slight impact on the federal funds rate. Based on current situations, there are articles stating that the rate was expected to rise as much as .5. However, due to the situation that currently is happening between Russia and Ukraine, the government is only expected to increase it about .25 and go from there."

At first glance, there are three options so without any analysis that would offer a 33.3% chance of each occurring. However, in my initial research I learned that the current target range is set at 0-25 basis points so essentially rock bottom. I also noticed in looking at the historical data that the target range is generally adjusted in 0.25% or 25 basis point increments. Given that, I would estimate there is little to no chance of the upper limit going lower, allowing me to rule out one of the three possibilities here. The next step in my research was to examine the historical data for trends and volatility. Given that the deadline for this question is relatively close (currently about two weeks) it would be important to know how often the rate fluctuates up or down and if those changes were connected to specific historical events. According to the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the target range held steady at 0-.25% from mid-December 2008 until mid-December 2015 at which point it entered a period of relative volatility mostly increasing until mid-July 2019, then slowly declining until mid-March 2020 at which point it returned to the rock bottom 0-.25% where it currently stands. Based on that preliminary assessment my initial thought was that the rate is likely to stay the same given it has been rock bottom for almost two years. Since historical data shows a relatively sharp drop coinciding with the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, I would think that is a significant factor for the rate being so low for so long. As part of a class discussion, I learned of a transcript from a 26 January 2022 press conference with Federal Reserve Chair Powell in which he stated, “…an increase in this rate would soon be appropriate.” Given that the economy and life in general are starting to open back up recently, that would seem to track with a potential target rate increase. Even after reading the transcript, I was still thinking there was a chance the upper limit could stay the same (.25%) due to uncertainty around the Russian invasion of Ukraine however that was mainly a guess and not based on any specific analysis. A New York Times article from 3 March 2022 on this topic, explains that the war in Ukraine is likely to “push up gas and other commodity prices further elevating inflation”. Because it was explained in the transcript from 26 January 2022 that one of the goals of a rate hike would be to help bring inflation under control, I now feel more confident that the upper limit will be higher at COB on 16 March 2022 than it was at COB on 26 January 2022."

The historical data points that in times of great recession the FED lowers the federal funds rate to allow for more fluidity in the marketplace and attempts to stimulate the economy in this manner. Forbes notes about these actions in the 2008 lending crisis. ”In 2008, the Federal Reserve lowered the fed funds rate to 0%, to revive the economy during the Great Recession. It did so once again in 2020 to minimize the economic fallout from the Covid-19 crisis. Lower rates make lending and credit easier for borrowers to get, which spurs consumer and business spending and grows the economy.” This practice is very cyclical in manner as the FEDs once again lowered rates to during an economic crisis and was followed by a rate raise once the economy becomes more stabilized. A look at what rates immediately prior to the 2020 pandemic could provide a good gauge into the fiscal mindset of the economy without an immediate crisis occurring. “To provide more accommodation during the financial crisis of 2007–08 and the accompanying Great Recession, the FOMC cut the federal funds rate to its effective lowest level, where it remained until December 2015. Over the next three years, the FOMC increased rates very gradually to 2.25 to 2.5 percent in December 2018. The Committee maintained that range until July 2019 when, citing the implications of global developments for the economic outlook and muted inflation pressures, the FOMC voted to reduce the federal funds rate range by 25 basis points. The Committee reduced the range an additional 25 basis points in September 2019 and again in October 2019.” As these indications talk about a range far above the target 0.25 top end that is currently in discussion. This along with rising inflation rates the highest since the 1980s the FED is going to feel political leverage to provide relief."
