Additionally, with Turkey invading Syria, Russia is tied up at the moment with the military and political ramifications of Turkey's actions. Mr. Trump is tied up in impeachment tweets and doesn't have time to continue to poke and provoke Iran into wanting to hold the exercises. China has not indicated it wants to hurry any naval exercises along which could show they only tentatively support the exercises. Too many obstacles to overcome in the next 26 days to hold a joint exercise. Hardly likely to occur in 2019 at all."

However, there are numerous signs that point to probable future cooperation in the maritime space. Many have already raised an MOU signed July 2019 between the Russian Federation and Iranian Navies - which seems to suggest at least the plausibility of joint Russian-Iranian naval exercises. Given the nature of the Iranian fleet as a littoral defense force and Russia's increased demonstrations of their 'blue water' capabilities, it seems very likely Russian naval presence in the region will grow (a number of Russian warships have transversed the Suez canal in the past three years for stated anti-piracy reasons among other things)"

Context of the question: ""Earlier this week, Rear Admiral of the Iranian Navy Hossein Khanzadi confirmed prior reports that Tehran and Moscow have signed an agreement to hold joint Naval drills: ""Earlier, we signed an agreement [on joint exercises] with Russia’s Armed Forces and the Russian Fleet’s command. Soon the preparations and maneuvers’ planning will start and they will be carried out this year.” 06/08/2019 From <https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/iran-and-russia-getting-ready-hold-joint-naval-drills-strait-hormuz-71661&gt; Note that this is only a memorandum, with no binding character. 2. History: have both countries ever conducted joint ops? Or combined ops? With what countries do they practice combined operations? • In 2015, there was a joint naval ops in Azerbaijan. Iran lent their ships to a Russian exercise (+) https://tinyurl.com/y2jp6sqr Flotilla was very small, consisting of a destroyer and 2 missile carriers. • Last naval joint operation was in 2017 in the Caspian Sea. Recent time, both national leaders still in office (+). Large flottilla with marine participation https://www.mei.edu/publications/irans-navy-launches-five-day-naval-drills-caspian-sea • Russia is scaling operations with non-Nato countries (+) https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/17/russia-conducts-tsentr-2019-military-exercises-with-china-and-india.html, including in the same drill space as Nato https://tinyurl.com/y62vwnrc. However, no operations were made outside their immediate influence zone (~) 3. What classifies as a naval combined operation? How many ships? Apparently sending as little as 3 ships to Azerbaijan classifies as a joint naval operation. Any participation of Russian personnel in Iranian drills or vice versa will be classified as such. 4. Why would they do it? How do both countries project their power? • Russia has not made any ops or drills in contested territory outside of their immediate proximity. That might change eventually of course. Iran has been capturing tankers in Hormuz. • Given the context of the capture of the oil tankers, a joint exercise in hormuz would not be scandalous (+) 5. What is the general geo-political situation? US-Iran It is my impression that Trump is currently easing out from the middle east and focusing on China (broadly speaking). The withdrawal from Syria and his position relating to the events after the houthi attack on the Saudi refining facilities suggests this is a main trait of the Trump administration. Russia-Middle East • Apart from some logistical and ground support, Russia is not interacting with the middle eastern front remotely as much as the media would have most people believe. For example, the S300 system sold to Syria is yet to be delivered, despite dire need of said system by their syrian ""allies"". This is probably to avoid interfering with Israeli interests. Russia has no interest in creating a conflict with Saudi Arabia -quite the contrary, as they would make an excelent weapons client for the russian military complex, and an convenient ally in future oil disruptions. Russia-Saudi Arabia  During 2017, Saudi Arabia encouraged the United States to remove sanctions on Russia pertaining to its activity in Ukraine in exchange for Russian assistance in ending the Iranian military presence in Syria.[48]  Russia has remained neutral between Saudi Arabia and Qatar in the 2017–18 Qatar diplomatic crisis, offering to mediate in July 2017.[49]  In December 2017, Russia withdrew diplomatic representation from the Houthi-held Yemeni capital Sana'a, in opposition to the killing of former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh by the Houthis. The killing took place as a consequence of his defection from the Houthi-dominated Supreme Political Council to the Saudi coalition in the Yemeni Civil War.[50]  From December 2017 onward, Saudi Arabia abandoned its past support for UN resolutions condemning the Russian military intervention in Ukraine, instead choosing to abstain.[51][52] In August 2018, Russia backed Saudi Arabia in its dispute with Canada, with Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stating that ""the politicization of human rights matters is unacceptable"".[53]  In the aftermath of the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018, Putin stated that Russia ""cannot start deteriorating relations"" with Saudi Arabia as ""it did not know what really happened.""[54] His press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, later added that there was ""no reason basically not to believe"" the official statements issued by Saudi Arabia on the matter.[55] In December 2018, Russian deputy foreign minister Mikhail Bogdanov warned the United States against interference in the line of succession to the Saudi throne by pushing for the ouster of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, following reports that U.S. officials would support replacing him with Ahmed bin Abdulaziz.[56] Bogdanov stated that ""the King made a decision and I can’t even imagine on what grounds someone in America will interfere in such an issue and think about who should rule Saudi Arabia, now or in the future.""[57] From <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia%E2%80%93Saudi_Arabia_relations#Saudi_King's_visit_to_Russia_(October_2017)&gt; Forecast: No action. Given the context of Russian positive involvement with Saudi Arabia and Trump's desire to cool the middle eastern front, it is likely that operations that might trigger a strong-arm reaction from Trump will not be attempted. 20/09/2019"

There were announcements of joint exercises in the Caspian sea around January, which did not materialize yet and which are in principle unrelated to the Strait of Hormuz, but which might give a clue with regards to the expected delay. For the strait of Hormuz in June it was hope to happen in the following months or before the end of the Persian new year (March 20, 2020), not clear which one of the two. Now apparently the Russian navy will arrive for the end of the year. According to one source in some of the multiple news I was checking, Iran likes to hold naval exercises in autumn, but in 2019 they happen in February, in 2018 in August and in 2017 in March, but in 2016 maybe late summer / early autumn (have to check on this). This makes it difficult to find an anchor. From 2015-2017 there were several exercises with the Russians in the Caspian and in 2017 another one with the Chinese."

Furthermore, the recent attacks on Saudi oil production further complicates the issue. While Yemen's Houthi's have claimed responsibility, Saudi Arabia's defense ministry has stated the attacks were sponsored by Iran, and Secretary of State Pompeo has blamed Iran and called the bombing an act of war. With tensions being as they are, I find it unlikely that Iran would choose to further provoke the US and its allies. Russia and Iran may conduct joint naval exercises in other parts of the Indian Ocean, but as of now it is unlikely they would do so in the Strait of Hormuz, baring provocation from the US or the Saudis. However, there is always room for miscalculation, and the Iranians could decide to use a show of force with Russia in response to US and Saudi action on the attack."

Russia and Iran have conducted joint exercises in the Caspian Sea but those waters are isolated and don't have a foreign presence. To ratchet up exercises in the open waters of the Arabian Gulf that transports 20% of the world's oil is a very significant escalation. Iran has agreed to allow Russia access to two of its ports as forward bases which will be a less provocative action than exercises. Russia has also called upon UN security members to draft documents to prevent armed conflict in the Arabian Gulf signaling it does not have an appetite to create an actual armed conflict."

Both are safer for joint exercises, in terms of potential loss of equipment and life, than is the Strait - especially for navies that have never done joint exercises. There are two Iranian naval bases outside of the Persian Gulf. It would seem small craft like fast-attack ships can use each. One is a deeper-water port capable of hosting destroyers. Based on info from cargo carriers, a trip from the Emirates to the Mediterranean takes 12 days - a proxy for what it would take to get from Tartus to those two outer IRGCN bases. Probabilities will be adjusted upward upon the two countries actually engaging in joint exercises in the Caspian Sea, or some activity in Tartus indicating a deployment from that base. One way to obviate the need for actual Russian naval craft in the Gulf is to re-flag a couple of Iranian attack boats and have them manned by Russian crews after they've trained on Iranian attack craft in the Caspian. This would be a low-budget and lower-risk alternative that would still support the headline banner of ""joint naval exercises""."

This news is from the 29 of July, which fits within a few months of this question but if that ended happening, then the joint exercises cannot be taken place in the Strait of Hormuz due to all relevant tensions and any possibility of disruption in the oil market as the price will skyrocket, therefore I believe that it is a loss situation for Iran went price goes up because they cannot benifit from a higher oil price due to sanctions.

The Iranian and Chinese navies held an exercise in 2017 in the Strait and in 2014, and the Iranians have held yearly exercise under the name ""noble/great prophet"". (open to being wrong about this in case I have missed any). The Russians could potentially join in these exercises, but they are held in December typically. The Russian Navy is holding a naval exercise with the Indian Navy in December, using ships from the Pacific Fleet (https://thediplomat.com/2019/07/india-russia-military-exercise-indra-2019-to-take-place-in-december/) This could be what the Iranians mean when they say that the drills will take place this year."
