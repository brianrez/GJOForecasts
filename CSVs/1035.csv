It eliminates US tariffs and Chinese counter tariffs set to go into effect this Sunday, the Chinese agree to buy some agricultural products, there are some intellectual property concessions by the Chinese (they will no longer demand US companies give up their intellectual property to do business in China) and there are some financial services clauses. The agreement cannot be ""inked"" until it passes some ""legal hurdles"" in the US per CNBC. A few democrats denounced the agreement while the Republics, so far, have been silent.

From this lens, his latest comments are not indicative of an unbridgeable divide but instead can be viewed as part of Trump's messaging campaign to the American public. He benefits from appearing to be strong arming the Chinese. - For China, poor economic data is showcasing they are struggling from the trade war and while the leadership is probably willing to wait out until after the 2020 election before engaging with the US on a major deal, it could very well be willing to take a step toward a deal in with a phase 1 agreement to improve/stabilize business sentiment in the short term. - Timing is short, reducing the likelihood"
