Based on Rwandan troops arriving, SADC governments taking this as an affront, and speeding up their deployments (first troops scheduled to arrive this weekend). I'm not too concerned about @LokiOdinevich 's point (re: death(s) occurring but not being reported. Southern Africa has a very large and diverse press, and multiple countries and agencies would have to coordinate to suppress. I'd say 4% (unconditional) of a death occurring and not being reported. Plus my previous concerns, leaves me where I am."

What role will these other troops/law enforcement play? If it's a train and assist mission, then there is less risk. If humanitarian, the risk goes up as NSAGs and terrorist groups will target these troops more often, since they can't discriminate.

The outgoing Chairman of the SADC is the President of Mozambique, Filipe Jacinto Nyusi. Under pressure from interested neighbours and investors, Mozambique has been pressured into accepting the SADC Force to support the central government. The Cabo Delgado province contains the largest and richest LNG project in Africa, operated by Total of France. Local residents have not benefitted from this resource where 52% of Mozambicans live in the four northern provinces and where the poverty rate is 68% compared to 19% in the South. Nearly one third of the 2.3 million population in Delgado have been displaced by the LNG project or associated violence. Although portrayed as an ISIS led Muslim insurgency due to the predominance of the Muslim population, reports suggest that local issues are the cause of the insurgency rather than any targeting of Christians. Interviews with women who escaped from the insurgents after the attack on Palma, made the point that the motivation held by the fighters concerned jobs and money and would leave the armed group if the opportunity arose. Redressing grievances and creating jobs rather than a military solution is perhaps preferable Potential fighters have been offered financial inducements to encourage recruitment. Local fundamentalist preachers have a socialist method of promising equality and a share in the wealth emanating from the resources boom. Therefore, the conflicts are the product of poverty-stricken populace devoid of hope or fundamentalism who have no choice, in their view, but to continue their terrorism. As the SADC forces are made up from African countries it is probable that one of its soldiers will be killed in the inevitable up and coming conflicts."
