"Before 1 March 2019, will the U.S. impose Global Magnitsky Sanctions on any member of Saudi Arabia's Council of Ministers for the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi?",2018-10-26T17:00:45Z,2019-03-01T07:59:45Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']","['Foreign Policy', 'Security and Conflict']",346,654,174,237,"Jamal Khashoggi's death has triggered an international outcry (Reuters, NY Times). On 10 October, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations invoked the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, requiring President Trump to determine whether any foreign individual, including ""the highest ranking officials in the Government of Saudi Arabia,"" is responsible for extrajudicial killing, torture, or gross violations of human rights in the Khashoggi case (U.S Senate Committee on Foreign Relations). President Trump has 120 days to make a determination and decide whether to impose sanctions (The Washington Post, Just Security).",https://www.gjopen.com/questions/1033-before-1-march-2019-will-the-u-s-impose-global-magnitsky-sanctions-on-any-member-of-saudi-arabia-s-council-of-ministers-for-the-death-of-journalist-jamal-khashoggi

Although Trump has threatened punishment if word came out that Khashoggi was killed, we have learned by now that Trump frequently threatens and does not always follow up with action. He also said how it would hurt the U.S. if we stopped military sales to Saudi Arabia, which is seemingly more important to him. This situation has also died down more or less and was more of a hot topic in October of 2018."

Using Mill's method of disagreement, we can use former President Obama who also did not impose any sort of sanctions regardless of their distancing relationship due to opposing ideas on the Syrian civil war and the US-sponsored Iran nuclear deal.

In this letter, the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act was used. As result there is 120 days, or 4 months, for the Trump to decide to impose Global Magnitsky Sanctions on any member of Saudi Arabia's Council of Ministers for the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. To how now been over 120 days, so as a result of this I conclude that the US will not impose Global Magnitsky Sanctions on any member of Saudi Arabia's Council of Ministers for the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

This lies just outwith the range of the forecasting question, but of course a response can be submitted earlier. Its also worth noting that despite the oft-reported partisan divide in the US, there is actually a decent degree of consensus within Congress on the need for Saudi Arabia (or, rather, the crown prince specifically) to be punished for this. This includes the Republican controlled Senate both now and after the Democrats take over in the House.

The kingdom forms the foundation of President Donald Trump's Middle East policy, and a decision to severely punish its rulers could spark an estrangement that would cripple his hopes of confronting Iran. It would also weaken Washington's strategic position in the region and offer an opening to rival powers (CNN). For President Trump, his reluctance thus far has shown his desire to not break any ties with Saudi Arabia. Pressure is also on congress to psuh for these sanctions, but there is no way in telling if they are willing to push the president in this direction. Talk about sanctioning Saudi Arabia is focused on the Global Magnitsky Act, legislation that authorizes sanctions targeting individuals responsible for gross human rights abuses. That is because the Trump administration has shown little desire to hold autocrats to account, while Congress has a role in Magnitsky sanctions. Congress cannot force the executive to impose sanctions but can embarrass it for choosing not to (POLITICO). It will be interesting to see how things go after these midterms and to see if the givernment will pursue such sanctions, yet the chances are still low."
