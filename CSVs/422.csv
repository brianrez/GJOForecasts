Total barrels per day have increased each month since February 2021, with a dip during that month that was preceded by an 8-month continual increase in production. August’s production was the highest since April 2020. Given that OPEC raised its production cap in September, as growth in oil demand is growing, though not as much as initially hoped. However, not every OPEC country increased its production as allowed by the new production cap. Nigeria and Libya are producing less, while Saudi Arabia and Iraq are driving the increased production levels. Therefore, I expect OPEC’s crude oil production will continue to increase above 27,000 tb/d, but will likely be limited to under 28,500 tb/d due to supply outages and increasing demand.

Starting with the facts we know, OPEC has produced 26,000 thousand barrels per day (tb/d) in June of 2021, and has an existing agreement to increase production by 400 tb/d each month starting August, although myriad caveats leave this steady increase volatile (World Oil, 2021). Some interesting facts to consider are that the price of oil often has an inverse correlation to the level of production, and that despite agreements like the aforementioned, individual countries typically produce fewer barrels per day than planned (Kenton, 2020). With the rising price of oil, it is possible that member states of OPEC reach their goal of increased production at a more sluggish pace than previously planned. With that said, the planned increase would take OPEC production to 26,400 tb/d in August, 26,800 tb/d in September, and finally 27,200 tb/d in October, just over the threshold answer of “More than 27,000 tb/d but fewer than 28,500 tb/d” on the Good Judgement prediction website. I assign a very small percentage of 10% confidence that OPEC will meet its agreed level of production based on the increasing price of oil the historical correlation. I assign a 90% confidence level that OPEC production lags just behind the agreed upon increases as member nations each cut slightly back resulting in a sub 27,000 tb/d level."

The article references a growth at around 3% which would categorically put it above the majority margin. With that said, OPEC has a consistent trajectory just below that which puts it just under the 28,500 mark. The consistency with that number is what tells me it will be under.

That said, will OPEC reduce production again to limit price falls? OPEC + sees little need to heed Biden's call to increase production. As mentioned in the July report, OPEC sees increased shale production and hence is not likely to accede to Biden's calls. So the possibility of clandestine production, which may not be reflected in the official OPEC charts, is real, if the Chinese economy settles and Delat doesn't create another worldwide lockdown."
