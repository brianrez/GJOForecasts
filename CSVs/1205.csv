Iran has many proxies operating in Iran and Syria for its interests. However, there are a number of negative influences going on in and around its boarders. ISIL was effectively disbanded, though many of its fighters have dispersed back into the Syrian population - and the surrounding countries like Jordan. This will continue to effect Assad's ability to maintain a hold on his power. The ""West"" has many forces acting within the Syrian boarders, but this is mostly anti - ISIL activities. There seems to be great interest by the military industrial complex for ""regime change"" in Syria, but little public support and no verbalized support by President Trump.

Assad also continues to have the backing of Russia and Iran as it seeks to remove rebel resistance.

Comming to conclusion - death probability rate for man of his age (53) in given year is circa 0,7% (western tables).
