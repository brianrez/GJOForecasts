On October 17, Sabato downgraded this from lean Republican to toss-up, joining the other major forecasters. At just about the same time, 538's model went in the opposite direction. It now has Kirkmeyer (R) ahead of Caraveo (D) by nearly 9-1. This is the largest variance I've encountered in this challenge, and I'm not sure why. Averaging it all out gives Kirkmeyer the edge 60-40, which sounds about right if this is supposedly an even race in an even district in midterm year that should favor Republicans."
