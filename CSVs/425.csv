It means they face a huge - post Covid lockdown wave - and the risk to stable government that a wave would bring will make it something the CCP will do everything it can to avoid. It will stay lockdown ""forever"". Which in a way suits the CCP, because I suspect it has no intention of ever opening up to the world again. It wants to keep its people locked down within its borders, and perhaps even locked down within their provinces. Ostensibly on the grounds of stopping Covid's spread. But the real reason, is managing the spread of dangerous ideas. It's gambling that its economy has reached autarky, and no longer needs its people to engage with the outside world. We are seeing it already shutting down large companies, and shutting down all uncontrollable social media avenues, like gaming. Hong Kong has meant it can no longer convince the people of Taiwan that China sticks to its promises, so it's a lost cause, with war the only way to get it back. The added instability to an already unstable domestic environment means war is not on its short to medium term agenda. And the rapid fall of Afghanistan will have only reminded it of how quickly regimes fall - China lives in fear of becoming another USSR. USA will want to drive home its advantage, and no longer distracted by lesser conflicts, like Afghanistan, it will focus on containing China. To that end, it will beef up its control of independent states around China - one being Taiwan. That means leaning on allies to support Taiwan while internal strifes distract China. With the Western vaccines breaking the link between Covid and death, it can get back to normal and get on with foreign policy. China has shown Europe it does not honour contracts, and a country that does that, cannot be invested in, making further trade with China a lost cause. So Europe may as well look elsewhere in the area, and that is Taiwan. So yes, the driver is there for the EU to open negotiations with Taiwan on an investment agreement before 1st Jan 2021."

The new EU China strategy has been released https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?reference=2021/2037(INI)&l=en It has been voted on and ratified by the EU Foreign Affairs committee and is going to the full Parliament in September. It re states that MEPs want the euro commission to begin work towards a Taiwan agreement. I expect that the EC will wait for this to be ratified to begin the impact assessment. MEPs will present a webinar on what has been done and the way forward for thee agreement at the end of September https://www.reneweuropegroup.eu/events/2021-07-12/an-investment-agreement-with-taiwan If the EC started the impact assessment after September I don't expect that it will progress to a recommendation to the council before 1st of Jan. Before 1st June 2022 I might go 50% maybe higher."

This is probably best avoided with same reasoning as - European public sentiment of China would need to be shifted first from vague economic opportunity to ideological threat for the expected Chinese retaliation to not severely undermine political cohesion in and between EU-Member States."

There is no trade deal, diplomatic or formal political relations with Taiwan due to the ‘One China’ policy. However, the EU being ever pragmatic, does trade between the two parties, but the EU does have a trade deficit with Taiwan. An investment agreement, as viewed by the EU, is perhaps a method of evening up the balance of trade."
