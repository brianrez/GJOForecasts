In the last ten years I think San Bernadino is the only one I think can be said to fit the bill (as stated above). *Many attacks that are labled terrorist attacks are domestic, not foreign, and this seems to exclude a lot of possibilities. *At last five fatalities raises the bar as well, although admittedly perhaps not if it is already established that we're talking about CCTAs."

So my base for this (roughly) 12 month period is 5%. A recent development worth considering is the fall of Afghanistan to the taliban thus providing a potential safe haven. However, this most likely be an issue in this timeframe as it would have to be planned and executed in less than 12 months."
100264,2021-09-24T10:08:44Z,1,[2.0],[2.0],"I don't think there will be a CCTA in US. First the US is more and more withdrawing from the world stage, which makes less likely to be targeted by FTOs. And I also get the impression, that various islamist groups and governments are (at the moment) more fighting each other, than some foreign powers which are actively withdrawing. And for domestic perpetrators, which get FTO inspiration, seems to me US law enforcement keeps a close eye on them. But when a FTO inspired CCTA is executed I expect it to be committed more likely by persons already residing in the US. @Hesch: The US and the Taliban have a kind of gentlemen agreement: As long the Taliban are not ploting against the US or hosting anybody who is planning attacks the US is turning basically a blind eye on the Taliban and what they are doing in Afghanistan. Furthermore the Taliban are seeking international recognition, want to build up an economy, secure foreign aid, so ploting attacks against the West or giving shelter to anybody who actually does, not such a good idea for the Taliban if they what achieve any of that, there is too much for them to loose."
25265,2021-09-24T08:15:29Z,1,[1.0],[1.0],I'd have higher estimates as Taliban becomes more established in AFG. I'd be curious to know what the crowds thinks of that at the moment.
102737,2021-09-24T04:29:48Z,1,[2.0],[2.0],"Post Afghanistan draw-down, and given the general downward trend in high-profile American international exposure, I assess a significantly lower risk of future attack vs base rates that could be estimated from the past 20-30 years or so. The odds of a successful complex attackâ€”if attemptedâ€”are also exceedingly low because of ongoing counter-terror efforts by the government."
