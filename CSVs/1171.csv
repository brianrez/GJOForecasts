His direct opponent Poroshenko had gotten a mere 16% of the votes, and hence only exactly half as much than Zelenskiy did, leaving the latter as the clear winner of the first round elections (https://www.cvk.gov.ua/pls/vp2019/wp300pt001f01=719.html). Therefore, I believe that he is more likely to be elected president in the second round of votes on April 21st. Secondly, a poll from the beginning of this week gave Zelenskiy an estimated 72% of the votes as opposed to 25% for now reigning president Poroshenko (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/18/ukraine-elections-actor-and-comedian-volodymyr-zelenskiy-poised-to-win-crushing-victory), hence also the polls see Zelenskiy to be winning. Thirdly, many may vote for Zelenskiy on an 'anyone-but Poroshenko basis', meaning that it does not necessarily matter out of which reasons they vote for Zelenskiy, as long as Poroshenko will not be re-elected. They dislike his personality, politics, and the fact that he did not deliver what he promised when taking up the position after his election. Additionally, 91% of the Ukrainians believe that their government is corrupt (http://time.com/5573719/the-quick-read-about-ukraines-run-off-presidential-elections/), hence re-election for the current President is not the way to go - many just want to see Poroshenko gone. Lastly, Zelenskiy is seen as charismatic, likeable, and funny who persuades with his mere personality. Moreover many like it that he is a TV-star as opposed to a politician, because they believe he brings new winds, directions and ideas into Ukrainian politics and see this as a step to actually make a difference in the country. Additionally, the content of his politics is pro-Western, pro-EU and pro-NATO which hence is mirroring the opinions of many of the Ukrainian population. Lastly, critics who claim that he has no experience within politics (loudest of all Poroshenko) and therefore should not be elected can be silenced by an easy example: Donald Trump! He neither had ever had any experience in politics, yet got elected as President for the worlds largest democracy. Consequently this shows, these things can happen if and having a former TV-star and comedian as President does not seem as unlikely anymore."

Ukraine had its first direct presidential election in 1991, and elections have taken place 5 times since that, with the 2019 election as the 6th in the country’s history. Looking closer at the past elections, the following patterns become clear: In two elections (1991 + 2014), a presidential candidate gained a majority of the votes (+ 50%) in the first round and was elected president. Once before the Ukrainian people have re-elected a sitting president (in 1999). Note: It seems only Kuchma has attempted re-election. In three elections (1991, 2004, 2010), the candidate with the highest number of votes in the first round has gone on to win the election in the second round. Note: In 2004, a re-ballot was held. In one instance, 1994, the elected president did not have the highest number of votes in the first round. While the above gives an indication that the candidate with the first round is likely to gain win the second round too. From this perspective, Zelenskiy is favorite to take home the victory on April 21st. However, it is difficult to make interferences from patterns based on so few data points. Looking broader, the past few years a number of ‘anti-establishment’ leaders have been chosen across the world (e.g. Trump in the US, and even Macron in France could be counted as such). Zelenskiy could be understood as being part of this trend and him winning the election does therefore not seem unlikely."

Second, Poroshenko as an the incumbent president only received a mere 16.15% of the vote. This indicates that the People of Ukraine desire change. In order to win, Poroshenko would have to receive 34% more total votes from people, who already voted for a change in president. Therefore, they are more likely to vote for Zelenskiy, because he does represent change. Furthermore, Poroshenko already vastly outspent his political rivals at 415 UAH, which is over 4 times what Zelenskiy spent (102.8 UAH). By this logic Poroshenko spent 4 times as much money to get half as many votes, once again indicating Ukraine is seeking a change in its leadership. Finally Zelenskiy is a well known and popular Ukrainian entertainer whom people already associate as a President due to his role in the popular 2015 Ukrainian TV show ""Servant of the People"". Therefore, people tend to have a positive association of Zelenskiy whereas they have a negative perception of Poroshenko because of everything that went wrong under his presidency (Crimea, Donbass, etc...)."

I also stated that, in the event Poroshenko was going to pass the first round, the new would have won over the establishment much easier - which is the reason why I thought Tymoshenko had more chances than Poroshenko to win the final election. I really think that, at this point, Zelenskiy is going to win for the same reasons already oulined some weeks ago.

Even if Poroshenko were to completely outmaneuver Zelenskiy at the debate the two agreed to, the latter's familiarity with alternative mediums will likely mitigate any damage caused."

Although not exactly similar, I believe the Servant of the People party is closer to the beliefs held by the Fatherland party than Poroshenko's more vague Independent stance. Additionally, it's important to notice that Poroshenko garnered 15% of the vote, as opposed to the 54% he received in 2014. Although I could see several candidates that were independent before backing Poroshenko, I see this steep decline as a sign that Ukrainians have lost faith in Poroshenko, especially after the scandals that have rocked his presidency. Admittedly, Poroshenko has the advantage of having held public office (and seeking reelection), but with six of nine candidates identifying with a party that is at very least mildly right and only three (including Poroshenko) identifying as an independent, I am extremely skeptical that Poroshenko could rally enough support to cross the 50% threshold."

If Poroshenko garnered all of Tymoshenko’s supporters, he would be at 28% vs Zelenskiy’s 30% of the vote, so the numbers are on Zelenskiy’s side assuming he doesn’t act in a way that costs him voters. Since Tymoshenko and Poroshenko’s views matched more closely than hers and Zelenskiy, it is likely a majority of her supporters will back Poroshenko, but some supporters may choose to not vote at all since their candidate is out of the race. There is also the question as to who will gain the majority of voters who supported the other candidates, and Zelenskiy holding almost twice the supporters of Poroshenko will undoubtedly influence which candidate they choose. Zelenskiy has challenged Poroshenko to a televised debate, which should help his standing among those still on the fence unless he performs horribly. Due to a lack of public trust in Poroshenko and the outcome of the first round of voting, it seems far more likely that Zelenskiy will win, but being the incumbent Poroshenko could pull ahead and win as he has actual governing experience while Zelenskiy has none. https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/tymoshe https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47819047nko-ukraine-election-1.5081156 https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47819047 https://www.rferl.org/a/final-results-from-ukraine-presidential-election-give-zelenskiy-30-percent-of-vote/29860319.html https://worldin2019.economist.com/Ukrainevotes"

Indeed, according to pollsters SOFIA, SOCIS, Rating and Active Group, in early March 2019, Zelensky dominates, often ahead of at least 5 to 15 points against its serious competitors, Poroshenko, current president and Tymoshenko, senior politician (23.1 vs 12.4 and 14.7 / 27.7 against 19.6 and 14.8 / 24.7 against 16.9 and 18.3 / 32.9 against 17.5 and 15.1). Volodymir Zelensky, atypical candidate from the cinema, gathers the most intentions of votes. This is due to the fact that there is a wave of rejection of the oligarchy (of which Poroshenko is a part), but also about corruption, a major theme of Zelensky, which has not really declined since the nomination of Poroshenko and his promises, following the revolution of dignity in 2014. In addition, Poroshenko presided over an intense geopolitical context, where things have changed little since Crimea was reunited with Russia. Similarly, the candidacy of Yulia Tymoshenko, former Prime Minister and idol of the Orange Revolution, but also oligarch, does not seem to excite Ukrainians, according to polls. The opinion towards Russia also divides the Ukrainians. Poroshenko is pushing hard for a quick break with Russia. Nevertheless, in a survey of October 2018, it is shown that 48% of Ukrainians had a positive opinion of Russia and 32% a negative opinion (Source: https://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=rus&cat = reports & id = 795 & page = 1). The Ukrainians, although wanting a Ukraine closer to the west with the entry into the European Union and in NATO, do not want to cut themselves definitively of the big Russian brother. Poroshenko plays on the division, while Zelensky, from a region and a Russophile family, can gather Ukrainians wanting to emancipate from Russia while wanting to keep links with the country. Volodymyr Zelenskiy wants to be the spokesman for Russian speakers in Ukraine, and he is in favor of a dialogue with Russia. It is also necessary to take into account the Ukrainian electoral system, where a first poll will take place on March 31, 2019, and a second on April 21 if no candidate receives an absolute majority. In view of the polls, it is therefore very likely that a duel will take place on April 21, between Zelensky and Poroshenko or Tymoshenko. Once this second round in place, it is very likely that Zelensky wins against any of its competitors. However this does not remain definitively concluded. If there is a duel between Zelensky and Tymoshenko, it is not impossible that Tymoshenko wins, because sometimes she is in the lead in some polls and can be rally by the voters of Petroshenko. The other candidates seem far in the voting intentions to succeed in getting into this system in two rounds, which makes their likelihood of 0%."

Disenchantment with the efficacy of government has pervaded Ukraine for several decades and corruption is widespread. There is no ideal candidate but voters opt for a leader they believe to be the most useful in spite of their likely corruption. Ukraine's economic and political situation is volatile at the moment and though it would appear perfect for a candidate such as Zelenskiy, he has absolutely no experience and will be completely unable to operate within the nebulous political elite. Poroshenko and Tymoshenko however both have experience and will be mostly likely to face off in the 2nd round. Zelenskiy's younger demographic also participates in voting the least. It is difficult to decide between the other two Tymoshenko's anti-government rhetoric and ""populist"" campaigning are completely unenforceable - such as lowering gas by half and doubling pensions. She however is support in the south and near east. Poroshenko has been enjoying incredibly low rates of support in Ukraine and voters in the centre of the country may prefer a change. Poroshenko commands the vote in the west however which tends to have the highest turnout rates as well."

The main question that arises, given the present expert predictions (https://www.unian.info/politics/10453227-zelensky-takes-lead-in-ukraine-poll-ahead-of-2019-presidential-vote.html and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2019_Ukrainian_presidential_election) is who is going to be the second candidate running the second turn in April together with Zelenskiy. Poroshenko, even with the efforts made with the new slogan and religion independency from Russia (https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-12-18/ukraine-poroshenko-embraces-orthodox-church-as-political-ally), is in the popular opinion a representant of the status quo, a character that had his limits in leading Ukrain in the future after the 2014's revolution. Nonoetheless, his odds are the same as Tymoshenko's ones to pass the first turn. If he's going to pass the first turn, a good campaign by Zelenskiy can have a huge impact in underlying the previous administrations' limits, which in my opinion can lead to his victory, If, on the other side, Tymoshenko is going to pass the first turn, the battle in the second turn will be between a new figure in the political scene (Zelenskiy) and a long-standing presence in the Ukranian political dynamics (Tymoshenko is present on the scene since at least the early 2000s). In my opinion, in both these scenarios Zelenskiy is more likely to win. Nonetheless, Tymoshenko has more odds rather that Poroshenko to win the elections. The 1% attributed to the victory of a fourth candidate derives purely from a cautios approach to the forecast (there are indeed a lot of candidates in this elections, I cannot exclude completely an outcome in which a not so probable candidate have a major uprise in the polls in the next month). Also, in the unlikely event that the second round will see Tymoshenko against Poroshenko, I think the anti-establishment votes (the Zelenskiy electorate most of all) will prefer Tymoshenko over the current Ukranian president."
