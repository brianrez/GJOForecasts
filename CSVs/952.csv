'Next year, the Council will adopt the decision on the conclusion of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, once the European Parliament has given its consent and once all procedures necessary for the entry into force have been completed, according to the release.' It would seem that the consent is provisional at this time. Some part of the EU (such as Wallonia have done before) or Macron under pressure from Fishermen, could delay the conclusion. Therefore the 'conclusion' as specified in the question will not happen before 1st January 2021."

If I have read the procedures right, basically UK parliament needs to agree, EU Council formally agree, then this is implemented and signed and comes into temporary force, simultaneously the request will got to the EU parliament. That request and the agreement going into force seem to be simultaneous. With the confusion from even 1 day of WTO terms could bring, it seems everyone is motivated to meet it. Seems very unlikely (maybe 1 or 2 percent) that either UK parliament or EU council will turn this down. Opposition in the UK have essentially said they will approve it and while with 27 national government sign offs needed, you would think there is some risk of an issue, everyone has said the negotiating teams have kept everyone informed. However, the time line is very tight. UK parliament set to approve on 30th December. Not clear when EU Governments are approving and that seems to be an ‚Äúemail‚Äù type process, although there was some discussion the Swedish parliament needs to approve it at one point (cannot find anything now). So we have a situation where the earliest point for this to be resolved positively is probably late on 30th."

Every deadline was crucial, and a no deal would happen after each, but then a new crucial deadline was made. All signs pointed to the EU Parliament not approving a deal this year after Sunday because they wouldn't have enough time, but now they will still have time if they reach an agreement today, but they don't have enough time so they may implement the deal provisionally. If they do come to an agreement, it will be sent to Parliament fast, officially resolving the question, but will they get there in the next few days? I think they are going to come to an acceptable agreement on all sides and the current UK talk of preparing for a no deal is just Johnson's way of trying to get the EU to cave a bit. It looks like both sides have made compromises, with the UK reducing its fishing demand from 60% reduction to 35% reduction over 3 years. The EU was asking for 25% over 6 years, so there is still a gap, but manageable. The EU also may have given in a bit on the level playing field talks, allowing for the UK to have more control over its sovereignty without immediate push back or tariffs if the UK does not follow new EU trade laws. It allows for other options other than automatic retaliation. I don't know how this one will go, but with as much as there is at stake, and the recent concessions, I believe they will get there."

End of negotiations is step 12 and we are asked whether step 23 will happen by 31st December. From the link on the Canada deal it looked like this took 3 months for that deal. Sure they can do it quicker than 3 months but feels unlikely they can do it in a few days. Maybe more pertinent questions like will they reach an agreement and will they turn a blind eye to a few days of gap. Would be odd if fish derailed the whole thing but it feels like Boris sees value in extreme brinkmanship.

If Boris Johnson gives any ground to the detriment of UK sovereignty (perceived) he will be finished as the Prime Minister by his backbenchers of the conservative party and the influential ERG. France has taken the protection of the EU as a personal matter, as their baby. It would appear that Macron will lose all access to the North Sea fishing grounds as a matter of principle as well as sacrificing the German automotive and the Italian wine industry in their lucrative UK businesses. The latest EU demands concern the adherence of the UK of future laws embraced by the EU with governance by the EU courts, that ignores any recognition of sovereignty. France cannot allow the UK to be a successful entity outside the Single market as it might influence others, such as Sweden and Italy (which are both significant economies). There has much made of the UK of 1 being against the other 27 countries. However, the countries who will be severely affected by a separation of the market is only Belgium, Italy, France, Netherlands, Germany and obviously Eire. The UK, being the 6th largest economy in the world creates a large hole in the EU single market as an entity in the global market. The whole process of the UK leaving the EU single market bloc has been made difficult by the segments of the establishment to delay and stop the separation of the UK from the EU project. The major question is one of sovereignty over potential trade opportunities, remembering that the Conservative party gained an 80-seat majority in Government by gaining seats in the north of England by the promise of offering the deliverance of Brexit in line with the 2016 referendum. The percentage concerning the answer to this question could be 90/10 or 10/90 and therefore 50/50 is the only sensible forecast which will probably prove to be false. To gain a sensible assessment and forecast of the current situation is not possible through any logical analysis."

Under the red-lines now being set by Macron of further hardlines on state-aid, competition, and taxes being tied to the EU, means that Boris cannot hit his aims. There isn't even room to compromise on this issue. Throw in the nationalistic and politically charged fisheries argument, means that Boris would be removed as leader if he accepted the deal. A mini deal that lessens the effects of No-deal Brexit is still possible however."

Moreover, Barnier has no freedom in trying to reach a middle ground as he needs permission from countries with big fishing fleets, like Spain and France. Another sticky point is that BJ (whose word is not always trustworthy). The EU insist the UK sticks to the rules (on fishing still), BJ wants more freedom. To make the scale tilting further, there is the fact that most of the fish landed in UK is exported to the EU markets. Tariffs on fish export will severely weaken the UK fishing industry. Then again, the UK Financial services that are worth a whole lot more than the fishing industry (Fisheries ¬£784m -- Financial services ¬£132bn), absolutely needs a deal."

The second that is more politically sensitive and much less in a commercial sense which is the fishing industry. Fishing contributes a minor portion to the EU Countries or UK GDP, but promises have been made by politicians on both sides.

93350,2020-07-18T09:34:33Z,1,[7.0],[7.0],"The definition of a Trade agreement is required to give a definitive answer. My opinion is that there are two possibilities and they are: a) (7% chance) - An all-embracing trade deal encompassing the full gamut of the relationships between the EU members and the UK (preferred by the EU) and b) (75%+ chance) - A skeletal or umbrella agreement under which lie a series of specific arrangements that refer to a particular subject and can be added to or deleted at a later stage (the preference of the UK). The UK government won the 2019 election with a determination to leave the EU, deal or no deal. The law was then passed to ensure there would be no extension to the transition period which ends 31st December 2020. An agreement in principle would have had to be completed by July 30, 2020 for presentation to the EU Parliament to meet the timetable. This date has passed. During the negotiations, 6 red lines have become apparent that both sides refuse to cross, and they are: 1) Fishing. The EU wish to keep the status quo in allowing their fishing industry to have unrestricted and unfettered access to UK sovereign territory. The UK is insisting on regaining control over its seas and suggesting a yearly negotiated quota system. 2) Level Playing Field. The EU is demanding that the UK is subjected to European standards after Brexit as in taxation, environment labour rights and state aid. The UK suggests this is not a consideration in any other trade agreement the EU has negotiated and is unacceptable and not conducive to an independent country and reserves the right to diverge. 3) The European Court of Justice. The EU is insisting that the ECJ is the sole arbiter of contract disputations that may occur. Not acceptable responds the UK as an independent party should be used. 4) Criminal Justice. The EU wants to retain the status quo by retaining the arrest warrant system. The UK disagrees. 5) Cultural Objects. With Elgin Marbles in mind compliments of Greece, the EU insists that all cultural objects be returned to their place of origin. The UK disagrees. 6) Financial Services. The EU insists that the City of London will lose its passport rights to operate in Europe. This is a major industry of the UK and as such is protected by the UK. The EU sees the UK as trying to ‚Äòcherry pick‚Äô the benefits of belonging to the EU while abrogating actual membership. The UK, after the Brexit referendum, European Election and General election sees it as listening to the will of the people and regaining its sovereignty as an independent country. Therefore, I propose a minimum chance of a comprehensive trade agreement being offered to the European Parliament by the Council of the European Union. It is contentious whether a skeletal umbrella agreement is necessary before 1st January 2021 that would be followed up by later deals, which I suggest is the probable outcome. Constant observation and potential updating is required for this forecast as pragmatism and politics are in a state of flux. https://www.euronews.com/2020/06/11/brexit-draft-deal-first-of-many-hurdles-to-a-smooth-exit https://www.bbc.com/news/52937766"

The City of London's outsized role in the Eurozone, and it's role in the bond market as well as international contract law means in the current crisis, some financial connection above current WTO rules will be needed by the EU. For the UK despite rhetoric; a sudden cliff edge and ""no deal"" being blamed on Boris whilst polls for ""remain"" are surging is not ideal. Likely to see WTO+ deal being rebranded as a successful negotiation in the same way Theresa May's rebranded deal was classed as a successful renegotiation."

Frost must prove that GB is serious about not concluding an agreement and Barnier (obviously has to respond) but must show that EU is united and no 'cherry picking' a la Tusk. I still think a deal remains the best outcome for both but ironically fishing rights seems to be the big dispute for an industry so small (<0.1% UK gdp). For whatever reason fishing seems to really cut through to UK audiences and so any return to status quo would be exploited by Farage et co. as a betrayal of the people. (interesting twitter thread on UK proposals from very well connected source on EU side : https://twitter.com/tconnellyRTE/status/1265276233694101510). This government markets itself as ""The peoples government"" so to concede drastically on Fish would do them no favours. Difficult to adjust forecast atm due to the precarious situation of Dominic Cummings (DC) but *as I type* I do not expect DC to leave No. 10. DC and vote leave gang are very much the driving force behind no extension and as such think is < 5%. The idea of a bare bones deal still seems achievable if UK moves on level playing field conditions (LPF) & seemingly total denial of EU fleet access to UK waters. If they want to conclude a trade deal LPF conditions will play a part in that but how much clearly up for negotiation."

That gets you to focus on Boris Johnson (BJ) quite quickly. My end point first is that I believe BJ will leave the EU without a deal. He has no love nor affinity for the EU at all. Meaning he can compromise a little if a deal can be made but does not care to compromise a lot if there are wide differences (which there currently are). BJ makes note of his interest in Pericles from his passion on ancient greek studies. I wondered if this was even a ruse as BJ is so open about it but it appears genuine I can cannot yet see any other ancient characters that we could draw upon to understand his thinking applied to Brexit (certainly none Italian). Much discussion also noted around time lost to the Covid pandemic. I believe BJ will justify 2 weeks delay he and David Frost were out of action but no more. For example 6 months is not proportional to the delay this year. The Israeli and Chruchill test that many pundits site as more modern day idols for BJ do not make me any more confident of a capitulation by BJ. The British Bulldog mentality is alive and well. BJs legacy will not be served by listening to anyone in the EU. Looking tough with the EU does no harm in terms of keeping Faraday and alike at bay either which is important electorally as BJ learned in observing fellow Oxford alumni David Camerons demise. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullingdon_Club. So are there forces in the UK that can make BJ rethink or at least be more flexible? I do not believe so. The civil service is being told to do as told or resign. It is part of the elected UK Government's mandate to push its agenda through the civil service knowing there will be friction and not caring to date about the push back. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/03/boris-johnson-britain-dominic-cummings/607363/?utm_medium=offsite&utm_source=yahoo&utm_campaign=yahoo-non-hosted&yptr=yahoo David Frost another Oxford graduate from the 80s has worked with BJ before. He keeps popping up around BJ so apparently one of the inner circle. I cannot see how he will be able to sway his appointer to any great extent in Brexit negotiations. I have left 5% for the Northern Irish to have their way this year as not much else will compel BJ and Co around Downing Street to capitulate. If they start up again then who knows.

Naturally, as this is a matter that will make or break the EU's entire survival, the EU would do anything it can to discourage more states from leaving the EU. Thus, while forcing a hard Brexit would hurt it economically, we would assume that the EU would need to hardline, as other nations who are skeptical of the EU would see how costly it would be to leave their experiment, and would be compelled to stay with the Union. Plus, Brexit has been going on for years now, and it would seem that given the reduced coverage of Brexit, people are less interested in saving the UK, and are more willing to say ""good riddance.""

Given that negotiations are far from being completed, the base probability is very low, around 5%. - While other FTA negotiations do not have a deadline, this one does. The transition period is supposed to end on the 31 December 2020, and there is a strong incentive for both parties to complete that negotiations, as otherwise, the WTO regime would apply and neither side wants to see this happen. In addition, both parties know each other well so their rules are already aligned as the UK was part of the EU for decades. This raises the probability significantly to reach a total of around 65-75% - There is an interest from the UK to depart from the EU's approach to validate its rationale for withdrawing. This will likely be accompanied by actions that will be concerning for EU member state's interests, thus slowing down negotiations. Probability reduced by 10% - The UK wants access to the EU single market and all its benefits, but not the related rules. It is unlikely the EU will offer to a non member all the benefits of a member as this would be a bad precedent putting the whole EU project at risk. While some of this was already addressed during the previous negotiations, the details in all relevant sectors will be important. Again, this will make negotiations difficult. Probability reduced by another 10% - The negotiations are extremely complex given the integration in so many policy areas, and both parties have some incompatible red lines. Probability reduced by another 10% - While there is a deadline for completion of the transition period, it is likely that an extension of the transition will be made. Even if short, this will delay by a few extra weeks the request for consent. Probability further reduced"

Since the agreement being sought (where the goal is to reduce alignment) is the reverse of typical trade negotiations (where the goal is increased alignment), it is unlikely to take less time to conclude. The only wildcard, giving a possibility of an agreement at the last minute, seems to be Johnson who, after all, ended up agreeing to leave Northern Ireland aligned with the EU if no agreement is reached -- something May believed infeasible because of it effectively gives up aspects of UK sovereignty over the territory. If Johnson is willing to do that, it is thinkable that he can agree to much greater alignment with the EU."

The ""Brexit"" transition period is scheduled to end on 31 December 2020, though my prediction suggests only a 4% chance a trade agreement will be requested by that time. The process, from start to enactment, for trade deal traditionally takes several years and involves 30 stages. Prior to being presented to the EU Council of EU Parliament, the EU Commission must first prepare and negotiate the proposal. The process includes lengthy steps, such as public consultation, draft proposals, and consultation with the Trade Policy Committee. Though several agreements have been made by the UK with other non-EU nations, these deals were determined as the EU allowed the UK to transfer existing agreements. Of the agreements completed since 2018, the amount only covers 8% of total UK trade. Additionally, relations between UK and EU leadership does not appear on good terms, with both sides expressing tough words to the media. Despite the obstacles, the UK has several incentives to ensure the process is initiated in a timely manner. A new trade agreement will help stop new tariffs coming into force after 31 December 2020. Seven of the top ten trading partners of the UK are in EU members. The failure to produce an agreement would leave the UK under WTO rules, applying tariffs on most goods, causing prices in the EU to skyrocket, and making products more difficult to sell. Based on the amount of time needed and conflict between leadership, only a 4% chance exists of a concluded agreement by 1 January 2021."

And for the EU, there is risk that its legitimacy and purpose is questioned by additional members without a deal. Even as 49% of the UK's trade is with the EU, it still runs a deficit, primarily as a result of goods with Germany and the Netherlands. The economic impact to the EU members with which the UK has a goods deficit could be the shock that triggers economic uncertainty for long period. While I suspect that the majority of UK exports to the EU could be shifted to EU members, the key industries such as parama and petroleum products would put the EU at a disadvantage. The UK government has the blueprint of the Canada-Free Trade Agreement as well as the experience of having secured 40 trade deals, by leveraging strengths and presumably accepting restrictions on agriculture based goods (it will be spun as more for the UK), it seems probable that the UK could have an agreement that would be politically viable within the UK by the end of the year. Furthermore, in order to minimize the economic impact to the EU and sustain the ability of the EU to serve a function for its members, it too will give a little to have something by the end of the year.

Possibly, it depends on the content of the agreement. It's safe to say the UK economy was substantially important to the EU.

While Article 217 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union for an agreement (TFEU) allows for the closest possible partnership with a country that is not an EU member the issues are highly complex and the UK wants more than is currently agreed to with other non-EU members. If negotiations do not look like they will be complete by the end of the year an extension is possible by a period of 1 to 2 years. This must be a joint decision made before 1 July 2020. The UK states it will not request or accept an extension, and UK law now requires a primary legislation to extend. EU officials have expressed concern that there will not be enough time to come to a meaningful agreement. (Extension chance ‚Äì 5%) Complexity is extremely high (no-deal chance ‚Äì 75%) The number of factors to consider are extensive, the political and economic drivers are intense, the time is short, and the historical picture is not optimistic. The EU is under pressure to ensure that the UK does not gain an unfair competitive advantage and will attempt to hold firm to try to maintain the same or similar terms with the UK as it holds with non-EU, but closely affiliated Norway and the Ukraine. Additionally, there are concerns over the EU having to compete in the future with a deregulated UK and the UK is bound by anticipated future trade deals, under which this EU/UK trade agreement will be cast as a precedent."
