Checking the link above, it seems the weekly gross sales decrease from an approximate 30 - 50% from the previous week over time. In this movie the last few weekly changes were highly variable but possibly related to the long holiday weekend or other factors. From September 4 - 10 weekly gross declined by 9.6% but the following week, September 11 - 17, declined by 59.5%. The average decline for those is 34.5%. This is within the range of weekly gross decline earlier for this movie as well as seen for a number of other movies as mentioned above. So, estimating the weekly gross based on a 34.5% decrease by week calculated to be an additional 2.7 Million by week 8 at which time the weekly gross was estimated, using this concept, to be around $51,000. Assuming the movie continued to run through the end of the year (14 weeks) based on this approach the movie will have made no more than an additional 2.83 Million by the end of the year, much less than the 8.8 million necessary to pass Titanic."

But assuming its boxofficemojo, and just going off GJDrew's analysis, I don't think JW will surpass Titanic. Since based on what movies will be coming out within the next few weeks ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_in_film ), I think cinemas will probably stop showing JW before or around the 22 weeks that GJDrew mentioned. Also, other films by Universal Studios (which made JW) are coming out soon, which might affect whether JW remains in cinemas (although I don't really know how such things work in cinemas, but just a guess)."
