The best answer to that is, it probably now does in practice, even if not in legal theory. Parliament will be given a vote of some kind before any notification is sent. 3. Brexit will be delayed? 4.

The government maintains that it can make the notification by use of the so-called “royal prerogative”....The Supreme Court appeal, however, will not be a mere re-run of the High Court case. There are two new issues which make the hearing more complex. The first is that the Supreme Court will also be hearing two references from courts in Northern Ireland, which are also dealing with cases about the Article 50 notification. The second is that the devolved governments of Scotland and Wales will intervene, with formal submissions about how the notification (and royal prerogative) should operate in the context of devolution."""

Even still the issue of ""UK Constitution and the sovereignty of Parliament"" can end up being an issue in the courts.

Others mentioned that the Supreme Court does not has to decide on the outcome of the referendum but on the juridical question if parliament or government can invoke article 50. Most rationales are about the members of the Supreme Court and what predictors presume that they will decide (this is very much from a British perspective. What might play role is: a) the juridical construct and bindings of the text of the article 50 (EU-perspective of leaving under the Lisboa Treaty). The translations in what languages will be officially recogniced as binding. At least English and French but probably at least one other language. The British will call in the English version, but the French could go for the equally binding french translation (that might be interpreted differently) etcetera. And that is only the language side of the problem and not different interests. b) who took the decision to get - at the time- INTO the EU (both British as EU perspective); Parliament or government? Formal logical argument. c) arguments about the 'sake of the nation'. It is the Supreme Court so they will have to give there best juridical arguments but in a context of the interest of the country. Any new ideas/ arguments? Many arguments to change my prediction rapidly because time is running untill March 1."
