Dictators such as Bashar al-Asad have survived through a brutal civil war and ongoing threats by rebel groups - meanwhile have managed to maintain power for an extensive period of time.

I think the likelihood that Tokayev flees the country is substantially influenced by which explanation is more salient, though I believe that both of these are likely partially valid explanations of the events in Kazahkstan. If the protests are organic and caused by economic discontent, then his ability to remain in-country will depend these issues will determine whether the situation is stabilized sufficiently. If the most violent riots were in fact coordinated and exacerbated by Tokayev's political rivals, I think it would be difficult to resolve the problem without concentrating power further under Tokayev, which could provoke increased resistance by the pro-democracy protestors. Structural reforms of the economy are also likely to be challenging and not swift enough to appease discontented citizens. I predict a small, but not insignificant probability of just under 10% that Tokayev flees. He is facing substantial challenges, but the fall of an autocratic leader in the post-soviet sphere might be viewed as problematic by other autocrats in the area, particularly Putin. I think it's very likely that Russian forces, perhaps under the auspices of the collective treaty security organization continue to conspire to support Tokayev and prevent his removal."

Would Almaty still be the seat of the important governmet institutions I would estimate the chance of the government toppling much higher. Almaty is the biggest population center in Kazakhstan, so a popular uprising there gives the government more time to quell any protests by bringing in forces from outside, while protesters in the capital have a much smaller pool of people to draw from a dissatisfied populace and would it would take more time for people to to arrive in Nursultan joining uprisings and protests. And furthermore, because it's a newly built city far away from anything, the people who move there are mostly government workers and contractors of all kind, in short living relatively well and secure and much less affected by the hardships of daily life in Kazakhstan, which led to the uprising in the first place. 2. Russian led foreign forces are already leaving as quickly as they have arrived, which I didn't expect so soon to be honest. But it shows that Tokayev can reliably count on rapidly deployed foreign reinforcement if needed as long he playes along with Russian interests and they wouldn't withdraw so quickly if Russia wouldn't be sure that Kazakh leadership is acting in their interest. So what could actually remove Tokayev from office? Well, the Russians are suddenly dissatisfied, but I think this is not very likely in the near future. He is overthrown within the government, but I assume as Tokayev has a long career in public service, I guess he knows quite well how the apparatus works. But I can't recollect something like that has happened in the post Soviet space so far. The most likely senario, I can imagine, that Russia will be militarily engaged in Ukraine and/or elsewhere, which is not unreasonable to assume at the moment and so thinly stretched in manpower that they can't intervene again that quickly, if the Kazakh people are rising up again especially when more widespread and in greater numbers. But again Kazahk authorities are now aware of puplic dissatifaction and won't be taken again by surprise. So my conclusion ist Tokayev will be president at 7 July 2022. Highly unlikely that he will out of power soon but not impossible, so I estimate generously 3% that he will be ousted. So what do you guys think of my thoughts? Where do you disagree, what did I miss? Thank you for your comments!"

Now, Akaev didn’t order the military to shoot at unarmed protesters (one of the reasons why it’s a different story). President Bakiev, who came as a result of the Tulip Revolution, was ousted a little more than a year later. He did order the military to shoot. It didn’t save his presidency. More later about why this may not apply to wealthier Kazakhstan; the involvement of SCO; the way the media portray the events in KZ and neighbouring countries. What makes me less confident in a “no” outcome is the longish timeframe and the possibility Tokayev will get replaced after this crisis—as a “compromise” or some gesture from the Nazarbayevs, or as a result of clan power struggles if this continues, or as a result of possibly having an early election (although the timeline is short for that)."

He appears to have support from the Russian Federation; he has so far been able to exercise control over the security apparatus; and he has been able to sideline his predecessor, Nazarbayev. His recent announcement that security officials should ""kill without warning"" has been interpreted as a sign that he has been able to exercise control and that a successful suppression of the protests is more likely than it was a day ago. But Tokakev only rose to power recently, in 2019, after Nazarbayev finally stepped down after nearly 30 years as president. As a result, he likely hasn't had as much time to appoint loyalists to key leadership positions or to prove to the military that he can maintain stability. One report even stated that Tokayev was ""once seen as nothing but an administrative appointee"". After Nazarbayev's removal as head of the security council, there have been multiple reports of infighting among elites and rumors that members of Nazarbayev's loyalists and family members have been instigating some of the street violence.
