I also think that if the US wanted to stop a launch that they did NOT think was headed to their territory (i.e. to prove US could do it/ stop NK form getting more data from successful tests), then I think it is more likely to come in the form of a missile strike at the launch site prior to launch. Limit in US / SK intelligence other than from satellites introduces some uncertainty, as well as NK's claim to have vertically launching mobile missile launchers that are difficult to detect with satellites. But if NK surprises the US too well they may get an overwhelming conventional and / or nuclear response. I think Kim is pursuing the ""goldilock's zone"" by using the madman tactic enough to get SK to talk and the US to stop ignoring it, but not enough to make the US think they might really try to attack. After all NK are not terrorists or ideological fanatics, they are more ruthless totalitarian engineers."

Fisher says the cruise missile with a CHAMP system strapped to it would fly into enemy airspace at low altitude, and send out strong pulses of electromagnetic energy. The enemy's electronic command-and-control systems would be jammed. Analysts say the cruise missile it's deployed on could then be splashed down at sea. The Air Force says CHAMP was not developed specifically to counter the North Korean threat. But retired Gen.

The committee notes the recent emergency deployment of a THAAD battery to the Republic of Korea to protect U.S. and allied forces against the rapidly escalating ballistic missile threat from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. While the committee supports this deployment, it remains concerned about substantial delays to the integration of and coordination between THAAD and other critical forward-deployed integrated air and missile defense systems, such as Patriot. The committee believes it is imperative that the Department of Defense be able to fully leverage forward-deployed missile defense assets as part of one integrated system capable of discriminating, tracking, and defeating advanced threats.

If an ICBM were to pose a very real threat to land, then most likely missile defense would shoot at a NK launch. Taking into account NK leader Kim Jong Un’s past actions and the USA’s past actions, I don’t think Kim Jong Un will do anything that will provoke the USA and it’s allies that might cause all out war and neither will the USA provoke the North in the same manner before May 1, 2018."

THAADs capability will allow it to intercept a missile in flight along its trajectory. This question has more of a political flavor rather a military one. Interception of NK missiles not directed at SK, Japanese or US targets will most likely will not encounter THAAD responses. A political decision to intercept would have to account for all strategic interactions among actors along with a unitary response from target nations. Attacks on targeted nation states would most likely have a high probability of a set of THAAD interactions with a reciprocal response from states in the alliance. The question therefore becomes whether a strategic interaction would result in a path closer to an initiation of war (by all actors) or not. A response, if chosen, would have to account for a ballistic missile armed or not armed with nuclear capability. If a nuclear ballistic missile were encountered in the set of military interactions, a selected strategic response would initially include a THAAD interaction along with an ICBM response, initiating a response to war. Given the high costs of war on human capital, military architecture and the outcomes of an ongoing conflagration will result in significant costs for NK, its population, SK and it allies notwithstanding global outrage at the violent outcomes of war; these interactions could serve as a significant deterrent for all actors. Lower level warfare to destabilize NKs military architecture and removal of its leadership is therefore significantly more likely than a set of nuclear interactions"
