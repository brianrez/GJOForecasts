I expect that the credit rating people and the UK authorities will be aware that the figures may not be reflecting what similar figures would normally signal. For example I am hearing that businesses are finding sales are weak, but at the same time are raising output sharply. I only have access to information supplied by friends (so not reported in the media, not from surveys). I am not saying that the businesses with weakening sales are necessarily the same businesses that are increasing production. The increased production is taking place to build up stocks in case of a hard Brexit. I have heard 2 months extra stock as being a target (to be held in the UK or in the rest of the EU depending on the nature of the products). The exact reason for the falling sales is less clear, but uncertainty is the likely reason. The consequences are that UK GDP could appear to be higher in the short term, but because this if the concerns about disrupted trade are resolved, presumably stocks could be reduced again which would depress GDP in the medium term. If the need to hold more stocks becomes permanent that will require firms to use more capital (equity or borrowing) which has a cost and prices will reflect that. It can be noted that a lower value for the pound has not proved to be a great boost to exports. That is not really surprising because in order to boost exports investment is likely to be needed (some production for domestic consumption could be switched to export, but increased exporting is likely to involve investing in marketing, distributions, variations in design as well as requiting and training labour, installing or upgrading plant and machinery etc.) In a period of great uncertainty many businesses will hold back investments or direct investment money into countries less likely to suffer from the uncertainty. So I expect contradictory signals on the state of the UK economy between now and 30 Sept."

It looks as if the intention will be to fund extra spending by raising taxes, but there is bound to be a section of the Conservative Party that will not be happy about tax increases. Therefore I think No Adjustment is most likely. There is a high risk that if the world economy catches a cold in the next couple of years the UK could be in trouble due to a large government debt and very low growth, which will probably continue until a Brexit deal is agreed, and if there is no agreement and/or a agreement that means leaving the single market and customs union, the UK economy is likely have an extented period of low growth as manufacturing continues to decline and before whatever takes its place does so. Prof. Minford is probably right that UK manufacturing will disappear, with a hard Brexit it will happen quicker than with a soft Brexit"

If Labour does make it policy and if most Labour MPs support the policy (most Party members apparently do, there are likely to be enough MPs from other parties, including Conservatives to force the government to also do so. In which case I would not expect S&P to downgrade their rating. But there are still quite a few ""ifs"" that could go wrong. I believe there is possibility that Brexit is abandoned - several Brexiteers have said that a Brexit that left the UK in the SM/CU would not be worth having. So if this turned out to be the only form of Brexit that the government could get passed in Parliament it is possible that the Brexiteers would turn against the only Brexit on offer.

The two options on offer to the UK will be (a) a free trade deal excluding services (specifically financial services) similar to Canada (b) a deal similar to Norway that could include financial services and could include being in the Customs Union. The problem with (a) is that it does not offer any answer to how the agreement that the border between the UK and Ireland will have no controls (in practice introducing 3rd country controls on most UK borders with the EU would be a massive problem and cost), and it does not help the UK's need for full access to the EU Single Market.

PFI contracts were seen as a way of keeping public debts off the UK's books, so that capital expenditure on public sector projects could be converted into operating expenditure and not show as part of the UK National Debt. The collapse of Carillian (will/might?) expose that ultimately the UK state would face liabilities when a PFI contractor fails. There have been questions asked as to how big the total PFI debts are; the UK Government does not seem to have the figures. It is part of the nature of financial scares that some seemingly small, contained event, prompts markets to take another look at wider cases and then realise that what had appeared to be an isolated failure is more systemic than had been accounted for. If in looking at Carillion markets notice that there are lots of ""safe"" PFI companies (and other types of companies) that have huge levels of borrowing and that when companies that rely of chains of subcontractors to do their work go bust then that ripples through the construction chain (subcontractors who were owned money might also go bust, material suppliers might go bust.) Maybe the Carillion failure can be contained but there is a risk that it could be a much bigger problem than it appears, and if it pushes up UK National Debt it could trigger a revision to the UK credit rating. It could also in the longer term mean that there are calls for businesses to be more financed by equity rather than debt,"
