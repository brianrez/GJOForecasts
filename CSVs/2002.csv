If I read the data correctly, less 1% of these refugees and migrants have been from Eritrea. Why? Guinea, Senegal, and Morocco are identified as providing more refugees and migrants than Eritrea (which is not in the top 10), and the former 3 are also listed as providing less than 1% of the total 153k. All of that suggests (if I'm not falling on my face somewhere) that there have been less than 1,500 Eritrean refugees and migrants to Europe in Q1, making it highly unlikely that we'll see anything like 10,000 or even 15,000 in Q1."

Good find, but the number of Eritrean migrants who try to come to Europe varies seasonally (probably because of difficulties crossing the Mediterranean during poor weather and in less than fully sea-worthy vessels), and last year it was at its lowest during Q1. So I think the number is much more likely to be south of 10,000."

The number of citizens fleeing to the EU rose from ~11,000 in 2011 to ~46,000 in 2014. However, if the first 8 months in the EU saw ~17,000 emigrants in 8 months, that comes to about 25,000 in 2015, which indicates the sheer numbers have slowed.

(The delta between the numbers from these tables is enough to make a difference.) During the 1st quarter of the last four years, (2012-2015), the number of Eriteans filing for first time asylum applications has not exceeded 10K. Based on data from previous years, the spike in applicants occurs in the second and third quarters, respectively.

Taking the recent engagement with Saudi Arabia against Yemen, the Eritrean economy may see a boost in fuel and money, and the citizens will be employed within the military. This may decrease the numbers of refugees somewhat, if we believe that the main reason for the exodus is freedom and wealth. On the other hand, an increase in Sunni presence (from Saudi Arabia and interactions with the Middle East), will likely increase the persecution of religious minorities (such as Christians), thus increasing the numbers of refugees.

Founded in April 1993, after a bloody and costly war of independence with Ethiopia, the State of Eritrea has been ruled with an iron fist by Isaias Afwerki, former leader of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front. Eritrea regularly ranks at the bottom of pretty much every global ranking, from religious freedom to human rights, including a noteworthy bottom position for the world press freedom rankings (below North Korea). The country is renowned for its lifelong conscription, where young men are forced to serve the government indefinitely with a pay of under 2 USD per day. Defectors, resisters and political opponents are regularly imprisoned and add to the ranks of the estimated 10,000 political prisoners serving sentences at the pleasure of the state and its extensive secret police force. Systemic violence, fear, sexual abuse, corruption, torture and murder are a regular part of everyday life in modern Eritrea. The ever deteriorating situation in Eritrea has unsurprisingly caused a significant number of its citizens to flee in search of better lives and an escape from persecution. In 2015 alone over 30,000 Eritrean asylum seekers arrived in the EU for the first time. As of June 2015, the UNHCR estimates that there are over 440,000 asylum seekers and refugees worldwide originating from Eritrea - a country with a population of around 6 million people. In Q1 of 2015, there were 3155 applications for asylum from Eritrean citizens for the first time in the EU. Plotting the data shows that Q1 is historically a numerical low point for Eritrean refugees arriving in Europe. Q1 2014 had 2,940 arriving and Q12015 had a slightly higher number at 3,155. Unsurprisingly the numbers have grown significantly since the 2012 Arab Spring threw Libya and Egypt, the two main countries between Eritrea and Europe, into varying degrees of chaos. My initial prediction is that the Q1 2016 numbers will be similar to those of the previous two years - around 3,000 persons. To try and estimate how this number may be wrong, I decided to look at three things: the starting country, the journey and the destination. My goal was to determine if any of these factors would cause an increase from the 3,000 outside value I predicted. Looking at the current situation in Eritrea shows that, although it does not seem to be a great place to live, it is not getting much worse. Many theories even point towards it getting better. Eritrea has achieved several development goals put forward by the UN and has in the last years had significant success in reducing the spread of HIV. The government is currently in talks with neighbouring countries to “bring it out of the cold”, and a number of European nations have reacted to the large number of refugees by suggesting that sanctions against Eritrea should be lessened so that the country can be allowed to develop economically. There are even persisting rumours that the national service will soon be decreased or changed. Although things are not getting better, they don’t seem to be getting much worse at the moment. On the other hand, there are prevalent theories that the government is encouraging people to leave - or at the very least not discouraging them. Around 20 to 30% of Eritrea's GDP comes from Eritreans living abroad, either in the form of remittance payments or in the form of taxes which the Eritrean government levies on its citizens no matter where they live. It is not inconceivable that the government could be encouraging a diaspora in an attempt to boost the economy. Despite this possibility, I think that if this was the planned tactic of the government it would be more obvious, and would already have been either publicly condemned or at the very least already have had an impact on the number of refugees and be reflected in the statistical analysis. Generally, looking at Eritrea I get the overall impression that the country is completely stagnant. This leads me to believe that there will probably not be any significant changes occurring this quarter that will cause the people to flee Eritrea even more than they have in the last two years. The second aspect to look at is the route to Europe. In the last few years the path to Europe has become ever easier for Eritrean refugees. Previously the Libyan border to the North was relatively well defended and acted as somewhat of a barrier for Eritreans moving up to northern Africa and the Mediterranean. Additionally, many other countries have started expelling Eritrean refugees. Notable examples include Israel, which has gotten stricter with the treatment of African refugees in recent years - most infamously by building a wall along the Egyptian border in 2012 and expelling large numbers of refugees in recent months. This tightening of the Israeli borders has forced refugee flows to move further north towards the Mediterranean where they can try their luck in Europe. Another relevant factor for the journey is the relatively mild winter that Europe has enjoyed so far. In 2014 and 2015 the minimum weekly temperature in Malta averaged between 8 and 12 degrees in January and February, and was slightly higher in March. In January alone the average weekly minimum has already been closer to 14 degrees. Nicer weather obviously makes the trip significantly less risky and uncomfortable and increases the chances that the number of refugees attempting to come to Europe by sea will increase. Of course, a number of other refugees will attempt the route overland by plane, car, train or other methods and through other routes. However, I do not believe that the number of persons taking these types of routes will be significantly affected by the weather. On the other hand, although the weather may make a crossing easier, the European Union has significantly increased its fight against smugglers in recent months. The ongoing media and political focus on people smugglers transporting the ever increasing number of refugees to Europe has lead to massively increased interest and investment in policing the seas and attempting to stop smugglers from even bringing people across to Europe. I think that compared to Q1 2014 and Q1 2015 these missions will already have a significant impact on making the journey from Africa to Europe even more difficult. However, the fact that smugglers and travel routes have in the meantime already become well established and well practiced may serve to mitigate the impact that increased police and military focus on the issue has. Finally, I think the destination of Europe is becoming increasingly unattractive and inhospitable for refugees. I believe that the goodwill that the EU has shown, championed mainly by Angela Merkel, will not be permanent and that isolated events like the New Year attacks in Köln will lead to increased antipathy against refugees and immigrants. Politicians hoping to win easy points with the public are already capitalising on the fear of foreigners and policies regarding refugees are already starting to become stricter. I think this means that the EU will work to increase funding for border protection, will make the process for registering as an asylum seeker or refugee even more difficult and will start to do more and more to deter refugees from coming to Europe. However, this reaction most likely will not have a huge effect in Q1 of 2016, but will probably be felt by refugees coming later in the year. And despite this, living in the EU is most likely still better than living stateless in an Ethiopian refugee camp or serving for life in the Eritrean military. Eritrean refugees simply have so little to lose and so much to potentially gain that I think very few changes in policy in the EU would make them not want to come there. Therefore I think that political changes within the EU will have a minimal impact on the number of refugees wanting to or trying to reach the shores of Europe. Overall, my analysis so far indicates that the numbers may increase slightly over last year due to the mild weather, but also that this effect may be somewhat mitigated by increased investment in border control in the EU. Of course there are other outliers that may be unexpected, but have a significant impact on the number of refugees. One not completely unlikely scenario is that Eritrea's conflict with Ethiopia starts again. This would not only likely displace a large number of Eritreans, but potentially also lead to the expulsion of the large Eritrean diaspora living in Ethiopia. Many of these refugees would move north towards Europe rather than be caught in the fight. However, the conflict has not erupted into full blown fighting in several years, and I see the chances of it happening in the next 2.5 months as rather unlikely. A second factor could be a change in the level of conflict in Libya. Currently I think that Libya has just the right amount of chaos to facilitate refugees in reaching Europe. Any more conflict and I think it would become very difficult for large groups of refugees to travel through Libya. Any less conflict and the government (if a true government existed) would be forced/supported by the EU to stop the flow. I do not see any significant changes happening in Libya in the next months that would change the status quo there significantly. The same appears to be the case in Egypt. The UNHCR states that continued instability in Egypt, combined with a lack of resources, has made it easy for refugees to travel through the country and up to Europe. The UNHCR predicted that this would be the case all through 2015 (it was) and I don’t see any significant enough changes within Egypt to indicate that this will suddenly change in Q1 2016. Putting all this together I think that the lack of change in Eritrea, Egypt and Libya will mean that the numbers will stay around 3,000 persons. It is possible that the mild winter could mean an increase to around 5,000. I also think it is possible to increase if the government of Eritrea actively allows or forces people to leave. However, I do not believe that the number will more than triple from the last two years and reach the 10,000 mark unless there is a truly significant event in Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia or Libya. Since these countries are quite big, quite unstable, and quite unpredictable, I say there is a 12% chance that some event will occur that will push the number up to between 10 and 15,000 refugees - as was the case in Q2 2014 (11,140) or Q3.2015 (12,220) - when the weather was nicer than it is now. I think there is an 8% chance that the mild weather (or some other completely unexpected event) will completely cause the flow of refugees to overwhelm Europe's borders and lead to numbers closer to those of Q3 2014 (15,145). I do think that the overall numbers of refugees will increase, however I really don’t predict an increase in the number of Eritreans, as their incentives and opportunities just haven’t changed enough to cause such a huge shift."

Eritrean asylum seekers are greater than my estimated Eritrean migrants for every month until August 2015, suggesting that migrants from the rush of mid-to-late 2014 submit applications in early-to-mid 2015. If that's true, I'd suggest that about 26,000 Eritreans (4% of all sea migrants in Q4 2015) will seek asylum in Q1 2016.

The number of asylum applications to the EU more than doubled from 2013 to 2014 and increased further still last year. The caseload from Eritrea saw the third largest jump between 2013 and 2014, an 154.9% increase in applications on the previous year (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/d/d5/Countries_of_origin_of_%28non-EU%29_asylum_seekers_in_the_EU-28_Member_States%2C_2013_and_2014_YB15_III.png). However, the total number of Eritrean asylum applicants in 2015 actually fell compared to 2014 levels by approximately 5,000 cases (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:First_time_asylum_applicants_in_the_EU-28_by_citizenship,_Q3_2014_%E2%80%93_Q3_2015.png) - contrary to other critical caseloads whose numbers continued to rise. Eritrean asylum applicants by quarter: Q3 2015: 11,685 Q2 2015: 9, 185 Q1 2015: 3,155 Q4 2014: 7,030 Q3 2014: 15,145 Q2 2014: 11,135 Q1 2014: 2,940 Fewer applications are habitually made in Q1 across all caseloads (likely due to difficulties in traveling over winter months) and the number of Eritrean asylum applications has never been over 15,000 for any one quarter even in the busiest times. I’m using apx 3,000 asylum applicants in 2016 Q1 as a base number. Eritrea is also accepting funds from the EU development package aimed at reducing migration from the Horn of Africa which might reduce the nearly 5,000 people per month that the UN says flee the country. However, the context continues to be highly unstable and tense relationships with Ethiopia coupled with increasing dissent could provoke a conflict or major crackdown that would create higher levels of displacement."
