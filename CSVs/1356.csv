It fell by about that much between February and April but that was over about 5 weeks (it then recovered) so it might be unlikely but it is certainly quite possible. In the absence of inside information to assume a 1% or greater likelihood of fall of this percentage in such a time frame I would expect to see a previous similar fall occurring in the last 4 years (100 two week periods). I don't see this in the records, so I judge the likelihood as being less than 1%."

It all seems to add up to a disconnect between the real value of the company and the share price. I would forecast a significant fall, but the question ends in only about 6 weeks so it will probably make it until then. When the fall comes it is likely to be towards the second half of the year and to be to much lower than $200. http://fortune.com/2018/05/14/elon-musk-tesla-executives-leaving-short-sellers/"

Everyone has had the benefit of the opinions of those stock analysts who doubted. So presumably the stock will remain at around the current price until something surprising happens. There is not that long before 29 June. We know that more re-organization of production is expected, so it would not be very surprising if output slipped back as that can be explained by the re-organization. For the stock price to fall below $200 sentiment would need to change, not production figures, not cash flow, not profits."

When Musk keeps producing bad forecasts (if you make forecasts that that are consistently wrong I think they can be fairly described as bad forecasts) and rubbishing the analysis of financial commentators an objective observer can only conclude that Musk is either desperate, over confident or has lost touch with reality, or is a business genius.

This crash was blown out of proportion by the media and Tesla was not found guilty because the driver was largely at fault due to neglecting the clearly prompted rules promoted by Tesla during the early release of the assisted driver tech. Obviously, if major crashes occur before the 29th of June and they are clearly found to be blamed by Tesla's negligence , then it will move the price significantly. But for this to drop the price by more than $100, it would have to be a lot of crashes or one that is very dismal. What I really want to say here is that the crashes are probably the worst indicator for a quick future price drop."
