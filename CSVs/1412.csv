I'm updating this forecast to 17% probability to reflect the fact that the Russian elections have already taken place. Navalny's role in the elections as a public leader of the opposition was arguably the greatest threat to the Kremlin. Since the elections passed and Putin was able to secure another 6 years in office without taking major action against Navalny, I argue that the probability of his arrest is dramatically reduced, especially given the short time period remaining in this question. Further, there has not been any recent major news regarding Navalny, indicating that for the time being he does not have the attention of the government. I still predict a minor chance that he will be imprisoned in the next few days because he continues to pose a threat to the Putin administration and frequently stages rallies and protests that often result in run-ins with the police."

Due to Navalny's persistent nature of protesting the Kremlin and opposing Putin, his opposition activities will not stop, even if Navalny might be imprisoned. His website and social media accounts have been shut down but he maintains a substantial following and his worldly recognition (and support) can be an added bonus."

I realize there is paperwork underway and that question timing runs beyond election. Navalny WANTS to be arrested as seen by past events. He wants to be seen as focal point for opposition. Tsar Vlad is clever enough to realize this and much more. Believe Navalny will be hemmed in quietly if possible at this point. What better way to express power than ignoring “tangential” items and changing the discussion (new means of delivering nukes and new Shirtless photos). Like him or not you have to respect Tsar Vlad - he gets things done (even if it leads nowhere in medium to long term).

23006,2018-01-11T02:36:27Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],I think Putin feels Mr. Navalny is of little threat at this time. Jailing him has no effect on curtailing him as opposition and is actually counter-productive
38,2018-01-11T01:54:06Z,1,[100.0],[100.0],"Give speech-people protest-get jailed. Bingo! January 28th He's been, there done that . . . 3x last year."

31450,2018-01-11T01:03:52Z,1,[45.0],[45.0],Navalny has been a thorn in the side of the Kremlin but I also think he only becomes more influential if the government makes him seem like a real threat.
83,2018-01-11T00:37:45Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],Depends on how hard he tries to get arrested. Going 5% on the odd chance he needs to commit a felony to get attention.

691,2018-01-10T20:22:59Z,1,[91.0],[91.0],"Vlad the Shirtless has in the past operated under the rubric ""Out of sight, out of mind""--if Navalny is not out and about in those awkward days around the election season, nobody will remember him and make trouble. This is not likely to work, but even by comparison with other thuggish autocrats, Putin has been unable or at least unlikely to entertain additional, perhaps more complex, thoughts."
41718,2018-01-10T20:10:11Z,1,[82.0],[82.0],I believe that there is a strong likelihood that the protests Navalny is calling for on January 28 will result in imprisonment or house arrest.
