"In National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra, will the Supreme Court rule that any state-licensed healthcare providers were improperly denied an injunction over California's Reproductive FACT Act?",2018-03-14T17:00:51Z,2018-06-26T17:00:35Z,Yes,"['Yes', 'No']","['Society', 'Health']",128,654,68,237,"In 2016, the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA) challenged the constitutionality of California's FACT Act's requirement that licensed healthcare providers post notices about the availability of state abortion programs, asking for a preliminary injunction of the law. That injunction was denied; a decision which was upheld by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Oyez) (SCOTUSblog). NIFLA is challenging this ruling in the Supreme Court (SCOTUS Blog) (Roll Call). The Supreme Court is expected to hand down its decision in its current term, but if it does not, the question will resolve as no. Confused?
