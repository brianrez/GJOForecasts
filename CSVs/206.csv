Cereals and meat prices were also up, while the sugar price sub-index fell for the third consecutive month"" Have we seen the worst of it yet, or is April too soon to see the worst of it this year? If the index continues to rise at current levels for March (numbers release on April 8), then April, then it can easily reach 150.0 but given that the index it's already at its all time high by 3.1 pts, one would imagine strong measures are being taken to control prices. Supply issues are being addressed, weather has affected crops in major producers like Canada, Brazil, and the pandemic is relatively under control, but war in Ukraine is not showing signs or easing. Brent oil went below $100 for the first time today since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, as uncertainty that the euro zone will be able to effectively sanction Russian energy exports eases and huge release of oil from emergency reserves are announced. Lockdowns in China, where over 23 cities and 100 million people remain on lockdown because of Covid19 outbreak are expected to slow oil demand. Could be that impact of rise in oil prices has already been priced in for March and would easy in April.

Since Feb 28, wheat prices spiked up ~40% higher than closing prices on Feb 28 and have since fallen to ~20% higher than Feb 28 close prices. Feb 28 close prices were already substantially higher than the previous year's prices and higher than everything since early 2011. The last time wheat prices were this high was in the first half of 2008, when there were riots all over the world because so many people couldn't afford food. Oilseed prices have also gone up: canola is at an all-time high, and soybeans are near all-time highs and above last month's average. Sunflower jumped on news of the invasion and may be coming down to a higher level. Palm oil jumped on news of the invasion but appears to have come down, possibly to resume its upward trend. On top of that, fertilizer prices are still at all-time highs, and climbing. Corn prices jumped after the invasion, are about 15% higher than Feb 28 closing prices and are not that far from all-time highs. Rice prices continue to climb. And the pandemic dislocations that had brought the index into the 130's are all still relevant. If the index climbed 5.3 points in Feb, I don't see how it won't climb substantially more in March.

In poorer countries, where price moves are harder to be hampered by govs etc., strong increases can be observed already. Should the Ukraine-Russia war last some more weeks, we could reach a territory where the harvest, essential to global food markets might not be produced in time. Ukraine's president, Zelenky recently urged farmes to seed even in the face of war to stabilize the GDP. This shows the significance of the conflict. Instabilities and global inflation threaten these price levels, why I think they are likely to appear."
