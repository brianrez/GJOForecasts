"Between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, will an armed group from Afghanistan engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Afghanistan?",2018-04-02T17:00:08Z,2018-07-01T06:59:08Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],105,654,51,237,"The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (The Early Warning Project). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 30 June 2018 and will be resolved in April 2019 after EWP assesses the situation in Afghanistan from April 2018 to March 2019. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilian fatalities occur in one or more campaigns. See (EWP) for examples.

While terrorism is typically considered indiscriminate killing rather than systematic, this number speaks to the significant violence and threat to life that Afghan civilians face in a given year. The Taliban alone have full control of 4% of the country and are a strong and threatening presence in another 66% (http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42863116). The Taliban regularly carries out organized and target attacks against Afghan government officials, military, and police. While larger attacks usually result in dozens to a hundred fatalities, these attacks happen frequently, and added together those numbers could unfortunately climb to 1,000 very quickly. The posing of this question means that this killing of 1000 civilians could be carried out by a variety of actors, not just the Taliban, making it even more likely to occur by March 2019."
