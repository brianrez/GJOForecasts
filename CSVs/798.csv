Throughout this process, the Unit 1 systems follow international best practice to safely progress and test the unit as it proceeds towards full electricity production. Once the process is completed, Unit 1 will deliver, at full capacity, abundant baseload electricity to power the growth and prosperity of the UAE for decades to come.”"

[1] My understanding is that power ascension testing must be completed before the plant start supplying electricity. [2] The IAEA commissioning guideline for nuclear power plants says that ""Successful completion of core physics tests, power ascension tests and other plant acceptance tests may take six months or more from initial core loading and removal of the shutdown guarantee. During this initial period of operation, it is normal practice to plan a short outage (e.g. one month) or multiple short outages to clear all items still unresolved."" [3] I'm not clear on what core loading means but I think it's synonymous with fuel loading (could also mean reaching criticality, which hasn't happened yet at Barakah afaik). So 6 months from March (September) would be the minimum amount of time if I understand the terminology correctly. However, if core loading refers to reaching criticality, Barakah likely won't open by 2021 as I can't find a source saying that criticality has been achieved (in May the CEO of ENEC said that criticality was ""a couple weeks or a month or so"" away). [4] Relevant historical background: there are 2 APR-1400's currently being used, both built by KEPCO (wikipedia lists Shin-Hanul 1 as operational but I don't think this is true, see [6]).

Construction of the Barakah plant began in April 2013. According to an analysis based on data released by the IAEA, the world’s foremost nuclear watchdog, it takes an average of 7.5 years to build a nuclear power plant. Taking this average, we could expect the plant to be finished by September 2020 which gives us a clue to the January 2021 time element contained in the question. [1]"

Fuel loading was completed on Unit 1 in March of this year (1) which would signal that the plant is nearly ready to go critical, delays tend to happen before fuel is loaded. I am not aware of the fuel from a nuclear reactor ever been removed before operations begin (in a commercial reactor). Although there can be difficulties in connecting the plant to the grid, this is a fairly regular operation and there are Korean engineers there who will have experience of these difficulties."
