Chiefs have to get past the Texans today, but are benefitting from the bye week and home-field advantage, Per CBS Sports, both the over/under (currently over 50) and point spread (9.5 to the Chiefs) are increasing as final factors are brought into the equation. 2. After that, I calculate the Chiefs to have about a 65% chance over the Titans. The Titans surprised (just about) everyone last night containing the powerful and versatile Ravens offense, so that's worth considering. But, I think the odds of them continuing that level of play against the Chiefs is fairly remote."
