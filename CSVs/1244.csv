It comes after the Director of National Intelligence refused to turn over a whistleblower’s complaint to Congress, which Democrats argue is unlawful. Though nobody has yet seen the complaint, it appears to concern Mr Trump allegedly putting pressure on Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, to open an investigation into Hunter Biden, the son of his leading Democratic rival, by withholding military aid. Mr Trump contends that he has done nothing unlawful. He vowed to release a transcript of a phone call with Mr Zelensky. That won’t mollify Democrats, who wish to see the entire complaint. The DNI will testify before the House tomorrow. Mr Trump should not take Republican support for granted. Just before Ms Pelosi spoke, the Senate voted unanimously for the complaint to be passed to its intelligence committee.”"

It would be interesting if the question were posed again after it expires. But my sense is that the focus for the Democrats is now on the primaries and 2020.

The mueller testimony in july might reveal something that could lead to a swift impeachment process, or democrats would perhaps just use the Mueller testimony for political spin.

In the last election cycle, the number of small donors increased significantly and many democratic candidates gained a significant amount of their campaign funding in the form of these small donations. Apparently, the diversification of funding can allow candidates to seek political positions that are somewhat more controversial, i.e. that of impeaching Trump, because they are rely less on a single donor and therefore a single set of opinions. There is no research showing how major donors relate to the issue of impeachment, and hence if some democrats funding could be endangered in the next election, but these diversified donations could perhaps indicate that more democrats are less bound by financial issues in their decision to support an impeachment process. However, as the Senate (naturally) still is not supportive of an impeachment and the potential political backlash remains extremely severe, I think Pelosi and the Democratic leadership will fend of an impeachment. Unless new and explosive allegations should surface. I.e. an impeachment seems very unlikely and I maintain a 5 % probability. Source: http://fortune.com/2019/06/13/donald-trump-impeachment-donors/"

Thus, the impeachment process would have little chance of success. Pelosi fears that the American population would hold a failed impeachment spectacle against the Democrats, which in turn, could lead to a defeat in the upcoming presidential elections in Nov 2020. That's why - despite a verbal escalation, it still seems highly unlikely that Pelosi will give in the pressure of those in the democratic parliamentary group that demand the impeachment."

This development is drive by a belief that without the heavy implications of a potential impeachment, the Democrats might stand to lose their cases for the White House corporation with the oversight and access to the full Mueller Report. Hence, parts of the democratic party now seem to be pushing for the impeachment process to support their other legal pursuits. However, despite this new avenue, the fear of the repercussions of a failed impeachment process still seems to be keeping a heavy-weights in the democratic party in opposition to the impeachment process. They will likely attempt to follow through on the oversight without directly drawing the impeachment card. Moreover, October 1st is nearing but the pending summer vacation and nothing more tangible than these talks, it seems increasingly unlikely that the House of Representatives will pass an article of impeachment against Trump before this date.

In comparison when President Nixon was facing impeachment 3/4 of Americans were in favor of impeachment and his approval ratings were in the low 20s. Democrats would have a difficult time impeaching President Trump without widespread support. President Clinton's impeachment moved quickly from the Star Report (Sep 11, 1998) to impeachment proceedings (Dec 9, 1998), that is unlikely here.

Others have reiterated earlier calls. Despite RMs statements , Speaker Pelosi remains adamant that the time is not right for impeachment proceedings, and the key committee chairs have not made any public comment that they are going to buck leadership. Even if it is decided to pursue impeachment, it would likely wait for the outcome of at least some of the numerous ongoing investigations. The House is currently scheduled (though subject to change) to be in their districts from 7/27 until 9/9 (https://www.majorityleader.gov/calendar), reducing the likelihood of an impeachment proceeding kicking off prior to 10/1."

Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have according to several sources shut down all efforts to start impeachment inquiries for the time being (https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/20/nancy-pelosi-impeachment-1336587). This is despite the fact that several other Democratic leaders have pushed for the impeachment process to begin, Pelosi and her allies apparently argued in a leader meeting that the impeachment would damage the party and drown the parties message. It is Pelosi's understanding that the majority of the Democratic House does not want to impeach the President, however the parties most radical and hard-handed are putting growing pressure on the House Speaker. This internal Democratic battle over impeachment started after the White House formally declared that former White House counsel Don McGahn — whom is a key figure in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation — would not attend a Tuesday hearing before the Judiciary Committee. This has led several Democratic House members to give statements where they say that if McGahn does not show up to the Tuesday hearing, impeachment inquiries are more likely to occur (https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/20/nancy-pelosi-impeachment-1336587). Even though Mr. McGahn did not show up to the hearing, no official steps have been taken towards an impeachment article. However, it appears that several House Democrats are calling for an impeachment inquiry into the president (https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/23/politics/democrats-impeachment-whip-list/index.html)."

Here, ABC/Washington Post Poll found that 40% of the respondents agreed with the impending impeachment, whereas 60% were opposed to it. These numbers are interesting to note, because the failure of the Clinton impeachment, and the president’s subsequent rise in popularity, has been cited as one of the reasons why leading democrats are holding back on initiating the process. However, the polls indicate that President Clinton held a stronger public sympathy than Trump currently does. This means that back-lash, in terms of a popularity gain, that the democrats fear an impeachment process would result in, might not be as likely an outcome. This support the loud voices, like Sens.

Several factors are likely to force their hand: (1) The progressive wing of the party that believes Trump should be impeached no matter the political cost to the party in red and swing states, (2) a need to de-legitimize the Trump presidency both to score political points and mitigate the impacts of what they argue are dangerous policies, and finally, (3) a sense of duty to uphold the rule of law and fulfill Congress' oversight role over the Executive branch. In this climate, it's possible that future revelations from ongoing Congressional investigations, the unredacted Mueller report, and public testimonies from key actors related to the Mueller report may the turn the tide of popular opinion on impeachment. This may give Democratic leadership the political cover they need to pursue Articles of Impeachment in the House of Representatives. The biggest question thus is whether political opinion will change enough in favor of impeachment before 1 October 2019, and that, in turn, will be at least partially determined by how grave and shocking are future revelations about the conduct of Trump and his administration (50% likely). It will also be facilitated in part by whether Republicans are able to get behind a plan B candidate for the next election. Mike Pence has done enough as VP to associate himself with Trump that he may be acceptable to the Trump's base if Trump is out of the picture, but this would be a very unlikely scenario (5% likely). It will also depend on overcoming the fundamental inertia of American public opinion - certainly a significant challenge when it comes to something as serious as impeachment (15% likely). Given the number of things that need to happen before the Democratic leadership is willing to pursue Articles of Impeachment, there is a very low chance that they will do so before October of this year. However, chances are slightly higher given the roughly even probability that there will be further shocking revelations about Trump."

67411,2019-05-04T13:24:28Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"I consider it to be very unlikely that the House will initiate the impeachment procedure against Trump. There are historical and practical reasons behind that. First, throughout the history of the United States, there were two cases when the president was impeached by the House (Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998). The third case of Richard Nixon was not completed, as he resigned from office before the full House voted on the articles of impeachment. Hence, even though the demands for impeachment, especially of presidents, are quite common, the actual impeachment is a rare event in the U.S. Second, as for Trump, demands to impeach him is nothing new. The talks about impeachment against him had begun before Trump took office, while actual efforts to impeach Trump were initiated already during the first year of his presidency back to 2017. As it is known by now, it did not turn into any impeachment proceedings so far. Third, many experts agreed that at the beginning the impeachment was barely possible practically as Republicans controlled both the House and the Senate. After 2018 elections, when Democrats won control over the House, the expectations about the impeachment have increased. However, even though Democrats have a majority in the House and an actual opportunity to pass an article of impeachment against Trump, it looks like it is still very unlikely to happen before October 2019. Throughout the last 5 months, even though they had a majority, Democrats didn't initiate the impeachment. What is more, from the latest news is known that the speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi urged her fractious rank and file to avoid a broad, open-ended impeachment inquiry as it might backfire for the Democrats in 2020 elections. To my mind, the House could use other punishing tools towards Trump, avoiding the risky option of impeachment. For instance, a Chairman of the Intelligence Committee mentioned another possible way of striking back by using using the so colled House’s power of the purse. Forth, I am taking into account the period of time. As the question on impeachment is due October 2019, it also contributes to decline in chances for Trump to be impeached. To sum up, as I argued before, the impeachment of Trump is very unlikely. However, I leave 5% chance for it to happen. On my previous argumentation, I deliberately tried to avoid the analysis of specific accusations to Trump as, to my mind, it creates a lot of extra noise that very often misleads the prognosis itself as we tend to give more weight on the impact when it actually has. To my mind, if there is a strong political will, the evidence against Trump might be sufficient to pass an article of impeachment. Especially, adding the latest news of Trump family lawsuit to block oversight of its finances (Subpoenas). Moreover, many compare Trump to Nixon, seeing the same pattern of obstruction of justice by using the power to limit the access to witnesses and documents. However, to sum all the arguments up, I still find it very unlikely to happen."
67414,2019-05-04T12:29:14Z,1,[1.0],[1.0],"I find it extraordinarily unlikely at this moment in time that the U.S. House of Representatives will pass an article of impeachment against President Trump. The House could easily pass this resolution based on their finding of the Mueller Report. The Report specifically left it to Congress to make a judgment on obstruction of justice and gave a pile of evidence that could be used to make this judgement. This in and of itself presents valid grounds for impeachment as Bill Clinton was impeached in part on grounds of obstruction of justice and Nixon was going to be impeached in part on grounds of obstruction of justice. There are also 16 other investigations that involve Trump and these may also yield impeachable charges. Moreover, The Democrats have a majority in the House and passing an article of impeachment only requires a single member to bring to the floor and only takes a simple majority to pass. In this sense if enacted the actual process will undoubtedly result in an article of impeachment being passed. However, Democrats are not willing to enact this process, making it unlikely that Trump will be impeached by October 2019."

However, most Americans aren't reading the original document, and just relying on pundits and spin from their news silos. So far, no minds changed, according to Gallup and several other polls. Democrats are trying to get the key witnesses (Mueller, McGahn, Barr) to testify before Congress on TV, in lieu of Americans reading the Mueller Report, and if they can succeed, the testimony will be pretty damning, in my opinion, enough to move the impeachment/disapproval needle. Meanwhile, Trump is waging a pre-emptive PR battle to block those key witnesses from testifying. Here's the catch-22: in order for House Democrats to compel witnesses to testify, they would need public support to force the issue, lest Democrats be seen as committing partisan overreach; but the public likely won't support forcing the issue without first seeing the witnesses' testimony. I can envision spiraling into a Constitutional crisis here. Not a certainty, but I can't rule it out. Thus, I'm recalculating the probability up to 20%. We'll see how this plays out.

No criminal activity was ultimately proved, even though he has not been entirely cleared of obstructing justice. Without sufficient evidence the judicial committee will not approve the article of impeachment. It seems improbable that, even if ongoing investigations eventually prove obstruction of justice, this will occur before October 1. This is less than six months. Less than six months for those investigations to be finalised and for the judicial committee to review those investigations for approval -- plausibly, not enough time."

Moreover, Richard Nixon was expecting impeachment in 1974 before he resigned. The rarity of an actual impeachment indicates the seriousness of the act, as it could result in the removal of a publicly elected state leader. The US constitution lists “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors” as reasons for impeachment; evidently the charges have to be very grave to warrant such an article to pass. While Trump has been an extremely polarizing president since he took office, and has been surrounded by serious allegations of financial crimes and Russian collusion since then, several key factors need to be considered. Firstly, the result of the recent Mueller report (in the form of the summary that has been made available to the public) did not establish a connection between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia. Consequently, it failed to give the President’s opponents a secure proof of Russian ties and as of now does not seem like grounds for taken such political action. This has been supported by the speaker of the house, Nancy Pelosi, who has expressed her hesitancy in relation to an impeaching the president, underlining the dividing effects such a decision would have on the country. That being said, there are still significant forces in the democratic party supporting impeachment, and their further actions will likely be dependent upon the both the results of the investigation ongoing investigations (e.g. the House Judiciary Committee’s investigation into Trump’s campaign and finances), as well as on how the Mueller report will play out, when/if it is released in its full length. Moreover, it could be damaging for the democrats to initiate an impeachment process in the house, only to have it rejected by the senate. Especially this close to an election. Additionally, there would need to be a strong, broad, public support for the impeachment, across party lines, which does not seem to be the case currently. On the basis of the rarity of impeachments in the past, the vagueness of the result of the Mueller report, and the reluctance of top democrats to support an impeachment of the sitting president, I deem this event very unlikely."

71038,2019-04-13T01:34:13Z,1,[1.0],[1.0],"The probability of this event happening is higher than 0. The reason it is higher than 0 is that Trump has already passed the threshold of actions at which previous presidents were impeached. E.g. Clinton. This fact alone raises the probability above 0. However, the democratic leadership (Pelosi, specifically) has indicated strongly that they do not intend to impeach Trump, so there would need to be a catalyzing event that would change the House Leadership's mind in order for impeachment proceedings to go ahead. This counterweight lowers the probability of impeachment to near 0, but not all the way to 0 due to the possibility of a ""Black Swan"" catalyst changing the political calculus during the timeframe of this forecast. Impeachment is a political act and Pelosi has shown a lack of political will to take this act under current political conditions. This brings us on to catalyzing events that could, in fact, lead to impeachment: What might those events be? There are two types. 1. A change of leadership in the house. This is highly unlikely in the time frame and can be ruled out. 2. The release of new information pertaining to Trump's ""guilt"". While this information may exist in the real world, there's no obvious mechanism (currently) for its release. Moreover. Even were such information to be released, Trump has a track record of disavowing information (whether it is true or not) that shows him in a negative light. When he disavows negative information he continues to carry about 40% of the country with him and we've probably reached the point where there's no disclosure of information that would change the mind of this 40%. This 40% all but guarantees that Republican leadership in the house would stick with Trump, even in the event of potentially ""extreme"" revelations about him - and the loyalty of the house Republicans to Trump, along with the risk of political violence in the event of impeachment has the House Democrats convinced that impeachment is a counter-productive path for them to pursue for Trump's removal, even if ""smoking gun"" evidence were to be released, itself a highly unlikely outcome in the first place. The reason for the dem's strategy of ""don't impeach"" under any new information disclosure scenario is four-fold 1. Senate Republican support would be required for a conviction (this is unlikely in the extreme) 2. Previous impeachments have not benefitted the impeaching parties in polls (Clinton / Starr) 3. There's a non-trivial risk of political violence, instigated in part by Trump, in the event of impeachment proceedings going ahead. This violence could negatively impact democrats's ability to regain power in a foreseeable time frame. 4. The threat of impeachment without actually going ahead with it is, in fact, a check on Trump instigating political violence against his opponents in the meantime. The thought process being that once he's actually been impeached, there are no more sanctions to restrain him from going down this path: a path he's indicated a preference for on a number of occasions. For these reasons, the odds of impeachment are negligible, as close to 0 as possible, but not 0."

More Republican politicians and business leaders are alarmed at his aggressive dealings with traditional allies, on tariffs, bullying and unpredictable impulsive decisions, such as suddenly withdrawing from Afghanistan and Syria, provoking a trade war with China and the EU. I believe that a majority of the House and Senate would be amenable if a relatively painless way was presented to replace Donald Trump with a caretaker until the next election. However, I have been shocked at how the Republican Party has departed from its long-term base. In the past some key Republicans, such as John McCain, and the establishment would have resisted the sharp right-wards tack. The profession of a deep conservative Christianity has been an increasing feature of Republican politicians, but hypocrisy and self-service seem to be reaching new heights.

67428,2019-04-09T16:35:27Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"According to the fact that hating Trump policy and criticising his lack of values is not enough to kick him out of the White House, I asset the possibility of passing an impeachment article for president Trump only at 5% because of the following reasons. - Looking at the previous cases of impeachment procedures, no president has been dismissed, but in two cases the procedure has been put in place, the House of Representatives have emanated an article and the Senate has voted (for Johonson in 1868 and Clinton in 1997). Nixon too was almost impeached, but he resigned before that the procedure started. Data show me that in the US impeachment for president has never resolved in a dismission and only few times in history it has been used. - Impeachment is a hard procedure. It is possible to impeach someone for “treason, bribery and high crimes and misdemeanours”. The last one is the vaguest of the three, so it can be interpreted quite liberally, in a restrictive or extensive way. In this case, it’s used also to accuse Trump of “obstructing justice, accepting what’s known as emoluments, sowing racial discord and undermining the federal judiciary”. - Usually, is the reason to which the Representatives bring into play, because it’s easier to manipulate. However, the entire impeachment procedure is long and complex. - To be emanated by the House of Representatives, the impeachment article needs to take the simple majority (218 out of 435). Today, Democrats control only 193 seats (indeed, in both the House of R. and the Senate Republicans have the majority). - To obtain enough votes the Democrats should find allies between the Republicans, in particular the ones that disagree with the president governance. However, even among them, only very few exceptions want to implement the impeachment procedure. - Talking about the reason of the impeachment, the possible charges are: Trump personal returns from its policies (tax, health care education, immigration), abuse of power in an effort “to punish companies associated with news outlets that have reported critically on him, including CNN and The Washington Post.”, Trump collusion with Russia (Russiagate). However, they are all difficult to demonstrate. - Moreover, the special counsel R. Muller is overseeing the criminal investigation into Russia interference in 2016 campaign, but a couple of weeks ago from its report emerged that there is no evidence of collusion (even if this didn’t clear him of the charges). Investigations continues, but the idea of the impeachments is getting away. - More than half of Trump presidency is already passed, and the elections will take place in 2020. Also, the impeachment procedure is long and complex. Therefore, It’s not worthy for the Democrats to impeach Trump now because they could more easily prepare the electoral campaign. - Impeachment could be even counter-productive for the Democrats, because they could be depicted as those who wanted to get rid of Trump through impeachment because unable to compete properly during the next election. Also, they can be seen as the ones who has been dismissed “because he was doing well”. *Nevertheless, impeachment could be a (risky) strategy for Democrats if applied enough quick (before the end of 2019), because during the procedure Trump might lose a huge part of its consensus, to the benefit of the Democrats."

In order to pass an article of impeachment against President Trump, the Democrats need a parliamentary majority at the House of Representatives (which they obtained in last Autumn's midterm elections) and a strong political or legal motivation. The latter seems to have faded in the last weeks: Mueller's report could have been key to launch the procedure, but it formally exonareted President Trump from the most serious accusations. On top of that, the current speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, had already stated a few weeks earlier to be against to start an article of impeachment against President Trump, as ""impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there’s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don’t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country"".

67625,2019-03-27T23:04:40Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"First of all, it must be considered that the question is not about the effectiveness of a complete impeachment agaisnt Trump, but rather if the House of Representatives - with a liberal party majority after the 2018's midterm elections - will pass an article of impeachment. If this will happen, a subsequent Senate inquriy have to follow. Two more specifications are to be added to this. First, an article of impeachment can arise only from suspected presdential acts of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. These acts, in Trump's case, can be linked to the 17 ongoing investigations about the collusion with Russia in the 2016's elections (https://www.wired.com/story/mueller-investigation-trump-russia-complete-guide/), to the suspected payment of hush money to women before the elections, and the suspected abuse of power underlined in the suggested literature in the question. Avoiding technicalities, investigations leading to a presidential impeachment have to be especially accurate - so, long! - and the recent findings (e.g. Mueller report) seems to avoid the impeachment for Trump. Second, we're rapidly running towards the 2020's elections. I don't want to suggest that, with the appropriate reasons, an impeachment is useless right before the president ceases to have its presidency anyway, but given the historical difficulty in concluding an impeachment procedure - as most knows, the impeachment in the US never happened, and the only impeachment that could have actually worked ended with Nixon's resignation - I would say that the House of Representatives don't have many incentives in igniting an impeachment procedure. From a political point of view, keeping Trump under investigation and continuing the efforts and oppositions can be much more rewarding. Nevertheless, as stated at the beginning, the House of Representatives can still decide to pass an article of impeachment before October, transforming the last month of the presidency in an endless trial/political campaign that aims at collecting votes in the incoming elections. I just don't think it's likely, because it's not worth it, most of all because of the probably unrealistic length of the procedure."

Impeachment happens under :""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors."", disgust of Trumps ethics and policies is therefore not enough, and cannot be a reason for impeachment. Moreover, In its history the USA has never passed an impeachment procedure. Twice they started one, and it failed (Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson). In the case of Nixon, he resigned before proceedings were started. Both Bush jr. and Barack Obama, were threatened with impeachment by members of congress as well (for Iraq, and Benghazi respectively), however nothing materialized. This results in an extremely low base rate of Impeachments in the US: 0% succesful impeachments in the US"

A few notable Democratic Party leaders who have called for the Presidents impeachment include, but are not limited to: Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders, and Chuck Schumer. With control of the U.S. House of Representatives having a democratic majority, there is a chance that an article of impeachment could presumably be passed, however, I think this is more of a propaganda piece for the Democratic leaders to rally their base and garner support for upcoming elections. In the hypothetical situation that an article of impeachment is passed against President Trump, a super majority is needed in the U.S. Senate in order to convict a federal official. Now, lets entertain the thought that the Republican majority in the senate sides with the House Democrats and passes the articles of impeachment; President Trump is impeached and his successor would be none other that Vice President Pence. In this hypothetical situation, President Trump would seem like the clear choice when given the alternative of a Pence Presidency rather than a Trump.

But then something happened, during the campaign, when I started to see him in a different light, believing he might win. That didn't go over well with my wife or friends, but, well, it was what it was and he did. And then he won, and the real controversies started, ramping up the craziness and the ""he's done for"" talk all the way past 11.... And STILL he's in the White House, betraying all expectations, defying logic. Part of me thinks he's indestructible, and no matter what happens next, he will survive it. He has demonstrated a clear capacity for survival. And yet, the wagons are circling, the rope looks to be lowering near his neck. I feel like he MAY accidentally stick his neck in the noose.

Why should the GOP protect a 'loser'? To pass a bill, however, not so easy and maybe not necessary. Other alternatives such as article 25 remain, as does a sudden and well-attested period of serious ill-health. This is not because DT can be persuaded to resign, i doubt he can, but at this point he will not be master of his own fate. The wild card, however, is Mueller, ably supported by Rudy Guiliani.

(maybe none maybe 1 but who?avoid a Pence presidency) which Republicans would remove (see Washington Post Article on electoral maths) -97%? less than1% chance right now of HJC believing they can get removal on current public evidence. Chance of HJC giving it a try to get move evidence or cause political embarrassment before cut off date. Would have to start hearing by about 15th Aug (the process took about 6 weeks from HJC start with Clinton, Nixon process was longer) for a vote to be passed. For political benefit is either never 55% before Oct 1st 13% after 32% based on available time and a constant rate of political actions. Preference for politically motivated hearing will be for hearings to be long and ending in a senate trial just before or just after 2019 summer recess so adjust 8% vs 37%. Plus Chance that a ""smoking gun"" will turn up making chance of removal much higher in time for 1st Oct. Smoking guns are rare in this case explicit testimony might be good enough or a bit of totally unacceptable behaviour by Trump 5 % before election 2 % in time for quick impeachment before Oct 1st. 11% minus 3 % for the hearings dragging on and further 1 % that if faced with impeachment would resign or would resign for other reasons. 7%"

Those meetings will be revealed as attempts to influence the election, The Muller team report will expose their data on how the Russians used social media to sway voters to believe many lies aimed to favor Trump and whether Trump's team participated actively, they were aware that Russians were acting on the campaign's behalf. In addition, the revelations of the investigations by the State Of New York will become more public and the evidence will reveal even more damning details about Trump's financial dealings in that state (and perhaps other states like NJ, FL, and VA will reveal investigations) that will make it ever more difficult to defend his presidency as one upholding the principles we profess to value.

The only way Pelosi will allow an impeachment vote is of the results of the one of the 17 current investigations - or the new House investigations - are so definitively damaging and conclusive that a removal vote by the Senate is all but inevitable.

Given mature viewpoint of Chairman Pelossi, House will only impeach if there is a good chance of the required majority in the Senate to convict. Would seem very likely though, that something substantial will come out of the Mueller probe. Assuming that, the likely declining economy and the combined effect of these two being a low likelihood of reelection for Trump, enough Republican Senators would become convinced to vote for impeachment (just as what happened with Nixon). i.e. if the House votes for impeachment, so will the Senate. As a side comment, given impeachment, I do not believe however that Trump has the honor to resign as Nixon did. He may well have to be carried out by the Secret Service."

Another factor is that the Grand Jury could be sitting for another six months at least, so Mueller is not yet close to delivering his report.

Only if the findings are extremely grave will impeachment occur as I believe no one in their right mind would attempt impeachment on solely political grounds, that could be the death nell of the American experiment - their political world is too equally split in a two party system.

While there may be more of a willingness in the modern era to utilize the impeachment process against a president, it is still low probability. I thus started with a blended probability of 11%. In addition, there have been many presidents who have been accused of impeachable committing crimes and have had opposing party members submit impeachment resolutions against them. In the modern era, that’s 7 presidents, with 2 impeachments/close enough to call it impeachment. That’s still only 28%. I assumed that, to the extent there is at least some evidence of wrongdoing and the opposing party is in power in the House, the odds of impeachment for that subset of presidents is even higher, but will largely depend on the nature of the alleged wrongdoing. Let’s call it 30-50%."

The current political and MSM environment is certainly NOT based on anything derived from even the tiniest bit of critical-thinking. Haters need to hate, and currently, ordinary Americans are becoming more and more conscious of this. Leftists are overplaying their hand, and will continue to do so, to their detriment. The MSM lost a good deal of its credibility a long time ago, and interestingly, no longer feels the need to hide its bias.
