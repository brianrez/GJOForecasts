Nevertheless - with a delta of only 139 between present MXN 19361 and MXN 19500 - that's less than a 1% move with 9 trading days left. Randomness alone could push it/keep it above 19500 on Nov 29.

The interesting difference is that the FED was in a hiking cycle last year and now we're in a cutting cycle - this lowers the ceiling on how much the USD can appreciate vs MXN. I'm confident that in the October meeting the FOMC will likely indicate a ""risks to the downside"" cut in December but this is mostly priced in already. I think US data and CB speak will show an increase in negatives compared to the Mexican economy and Banxico. All of this sounds USD negative but in my view a stock market ""correction"" in November or negative MXN or global news will be more impactful and we'll see a similar pattern to 2018 Q4 trading with a lower ceiling.

Since then Mexico's formal sector has increased while its informal sector has decreased. There are concerns with Trump's trade war that could indirectly affect the value of the currency via changing how currency circulates in and out of those countries combined with the new renegotiated NAFTA being renamed as the Candad, Mexico US Agreement. Odds of dipping below $17.5 or going above $20.5 are very small.
