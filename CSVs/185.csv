However, this appears to be a volatile time in both German politics and European politics as a whole. Changing economic circumstances, a resolution (or non-resolution) of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the apparent fluidity of Green/SPD support increase uncertainty. 15 % is likely a fair assessment."

However, the CDU has a relatively low value given its historical values, while the SPD is roughly at its mean (time horizon from 2006). From this perspective, I take my baseline probability to about 43% (CDU 52% and Greens 5%). However, the current political situation is highly volatile, as indicated by the high swings in recent polling numbers. There are several political aspects, which could play a substantial role. The Ukraine crisis could lead to prolonged crisis and struggle between the West and Russia. This could lead to ""rallying around the flag"", which would support SPD. On the other hand, a substantial financial crisis with the prospect of a severe energy crisis (due to a stop of gas from Russia), could substantially damage the SPD. Currently, I believe that the first scenario appears slightly more likely, which will increase the changes of the SPD. Refugees from Ukraine are currently welcomed by a wide majority of the population. However, it could be that the support will wane until September and the integration is done poorly (like in 2015, which led to substantial loses for the governing CDU, but curiously not the SPD even though it was also part of the government), which could hurt the SPD. However, the Ukraine refugees are better educated, are majority female/kids and come from a closer place than in 2015, so it is difficult to take clues from the 2015 crisis. In total, I think, the refugees have no impact as of now. Additionally, the general economic outlook appears slightly optimistic (aside from the Ukraine struggle and its potential influence), which should also help the SPD. Furthermore, there is a small risk that the influence of Olaf Scholz in the Cum-ex and Wirecard scandals is bigger than currently known, which would substantially decrease the chances for the SPD (but is highly unlikely). Additional insights from polling data might be interesting."
