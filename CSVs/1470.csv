What will be the short-term interest rate for Mexico (MEX) in December 2017?,2017-11-29T17:00:00Z,2018-01-01T04:59:17Z,More than 7.5,"['Less than 7.3', 'Between 7.3 and 7.5, inclusive', 'More than 7.5']",['Finance'],154,654,70,237,"This question will be resolved using monthly data reported by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Data is retrievable on the 'Short-term interest rates' table on the web site. The relevant country can be found in the HIGHLIGHTED COUNTRIES or LOCATION field, and the relevant time period can be found in the TIME field. Values will be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth.
