According to the text of the question, ""the estimated range of a launched ICBM will be determined using data and reporting provided by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)."" This means that the question will resolve when CSIS publishes a news item that states which ICBM was launched, which will probably be tomorrow, although it could take a little longer than that. We need CSIS to determine which ICBM was launched, because that will determine the estimated range. In any case, Hwasong-15 and Hwasong-17 both have 10,000 km+ ranges, so this question is effectively done."
