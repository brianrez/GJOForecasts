Now when we raise our hand and say ""We'll help you!"", everyone is going to tell us to get lost.

Since there is currently no dispute mechanism in place for tripartite talks, the states will probably remain in a stalemate. Compounding the issue is COVID-19, stifling the ability for the three states to meet and negotiate. https://www.theafricareport.com/44337/ethiopia-egypt-sudan-trust-linkage-and-cooperation-can-end-dam-dispute/ https://theconversation.com/suspension-of-us-aid-to-ethiopia-is-yet-another-example-of-trumps-disregard-for-africa-146460 https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2020/08/05/the-controversy-over-the-grand-ethiopian-renaissance-dam/"

It would appear that the dam is being filled by natural causes i.e. rain in June through September that was shown by satellite images after the talks had broken down. Egypt and the Sudan depend on these waters from the Blue Nile and control of the water supply downstream gives Ethiopia significant power both in the political and energy sense. Video talks are between the three states are commencing as reported of 27th October. Another concern over the resolution of this disagreement and obvious lack of trust is the involvement of China and its campaign to increase its influence in Africa. The Presidential election in the US will perhaps have an effect on the continuing talks with a potential change in US foreign policy (or not). The dam will take 5-15 years to fill to its capacity and the longer period the better to offset any dramatic effects. However, a build-up of silt as filling begins, will present social issues. At this time an agreed resolution, within the next 12 months, that is agreeable an advantageous to both sides with increased US/China interference seems unlikely."
