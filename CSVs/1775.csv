Conclusion: ""The de jure abandonment of Turkey’s EU ambition, no matter how unlikely an accession outcome is at this point, would rob Erdogan of an extremely useful political propaganda tool. At the same time, were the EU Commission and member states to actually end Turkey’s candidacy, it would mean not only admitting the failure of soft power and conditionality on a grand scale but also playing into Erdogan’s hand and solidifying his increasingly undemocratic grasp on power within Turkey. Thus, the European Parliament’s resolution—while it makes for good headlines and allows the EU to claim it is standing up for democracy in Turkey—in reality is little more than fodder for Erdogan’s domestic political game and a fig leaf for the EU."""

So far the Turks had held back from such a step, but there are political costs for Erdogan in taking hits with only a verbal response. Still an outside chance, though."

The same could be said of many differing peoples and nations but the gap between conservative Turkish and liberal European values is too wide to bridge or reverse in my opinion.

Looks like the focus in the Turkey-EU relations would be on pragmatic cooperation on issues like the refugees and the customs union (see http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-eu-minister-idUSKBN1871XA). Also it seems that on both side there are both agitators that push for radical outcomes and pragmatists who don't want to rock the boat too much. The death penalty issue could provide clues - if Erdogan pushes it to the back burner, a formal break with the EU would be less likely."

The EU was holding back on ending Turkey's application in order to leave a route for Turkey if it changed its ways.
