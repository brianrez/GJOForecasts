There are four sources I'm considering: 1) The projection of the opinion polls, adjusted according to historical opposition underpolling and the skew of the electoral system to rural votes. This projects that PSUV will have 35% of the seats in the National Assembly (MUD should have 46%). So that's a pretty emphatic loss of control. I'm weighting this 60%. 2) Turnout for Primaries - PSUV's turnout was twice that of MUD. Using this as a proxy for grassroots strength, that suggests PSUV will keep control. I'm weighting this 20%. 3) A referendum on the government/status quo. I spotted this link on another prediction (it was a link from the article linked to by @Dima K), but basically if you plug the current ""positivity"" rating (12%) into the tool, you end up with similar numbers to the adjusted opinion polling projection (36% for PSUV). To be honest, I'm not convinced - it worked well in 2010, but there are lots of explanations that suggest correlation and not causation. Still, I'm weighting this 10%. 4) The chance of the poll being stolen/disrupted. I was inclined to ignore this, as it felt like 3rd world/populist snobbery, but there have been some signs (helpfully pointed out by @vox vox) that there have been more than usual shenanigans around dodgy electoral practices. Based upon what I've read, while I think there will be some dodginess, I think there is only a 30% chance this could determine the poll. I'm weighting this 10%."
