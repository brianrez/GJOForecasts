Powell said that “..we have resisted the temptation to try and quantify what that means, but when we are above target… we can do that” . This will leave stakes SUPER high ahead of inflation figures from April when the big inflationary effects start to kick in. After all, it is much easier to say that you will allow inflation to overshoot as long as you actually don’t overshoot, but once the overshooting kicks in, it will be much more difficult to sound as dovish. https://corporate.nordea.com/article/64255/fomc-review-officially-behind-the-curve-and-proud-of-it"
