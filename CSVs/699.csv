As soon as a fire has crossed 100,000 it appears it keeps burning for several reasons, such as a lack of water for containment or as a natural barrier, the geographical structure that promotes stronger winds, the type of local woods or vegetation that is affected and maybe even the impassable landscape.

Most wildfires this season are the result of lightning during thunderstorms, so we are basically talking about a very low probability of additional wildfires through that way of ignition which could grow to 10,000 or more acres. The questions then would be: /for how long will each individual of the current fires go on burning before it will be extinct and considered no longer active? /how many of the remaining fires <10,000 acres (currently 29, 16 of which have a ""containment"" status 10% to 98%, 13 have no such status and either lack detailed info or are already considered as contained) will reach the required criteria by 01 October 2020, and will remain active as well? However, there are other causes for wildfires to start, most importantly human intent, and technical (or human) failure. The 2018 Camp Fire (153,336 acres burned, ""was the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history"") was almost surely ignited by faulty power lines belonging to the utility company Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Fire_%282018%29 Drought as a precondition of wildfires will thus advance additional wildfires which will be ignited in other ways than lightning. Severe winds or fire storms will determine, how fast the affected area will grow. So far winds are likely to play a subordinated role."
