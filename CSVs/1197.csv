Trudeau has more ability to strike coalition given his Machiavellian desire to stay in power even if it’s bad for Canada. From the Economist “Canadians vote today in a general election which polls suggest will result in a hung parliament and possibly a new party in power. The governing Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, look likely to win roughly as many seats as the opposition Conservatives, under Andrew Scheer. If neither party gets a majority, then either would need support from smaller parties to govern. The centrist Liberals could look to the left-leaning New Democratic Party, whose leader, Jagmeet Singh, has ruled out supporting the right-leaning Conservatives. That duo share some common ground on climate change, immigration and the need for a single-payer drug programme. The Conservatives might turn to the separatist Bloc Québécois, which has sometimes backed them in the past. But the Bloc’s leader, Yves-François Blanchet, dislikes the Conservatives’ lack of zeal on climate change, and says his party will divvy out its support, issue by issue. In 2015 the Liberals won convincingly; expect a cliff-hanger today.“"

Second article by Conrad (formerly Lord) Black who advocated voting for Trudeau in prior election highlights what a disaster he has turned out to be. Despite this I believe Trudeau will attempt to cling to power. He has pulled out all stops in campaigning. He is fear mongering against others. He has nothing to go back to (mostly held dead end part time jobs prior to politics given his life of privilege). More importantly at this point his legacy (and family name) would be thrown in dustbin. https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/election-2019/with-a-close-election-looming-here-are-three-likely-scenarios-and-how-they-would-play-out https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/election-2019/conrad-black-trudeau-has-failed-voters-should-toss-him-out

Trudeau still retains a large loyal block of voters in Quebec who mostly view his attempt to save Quebec jobs as heroic rather than corrupt.

While Alberta (with it's small population) will probably vote largely for the Conservatives, and (for the moment) the rest of the country (except for Quebec) is too close to call, the Conservatives don't have many friends among the other parties (ie. the Greens and the NDP). Thus the Conservatives will need an outright sweep to topple Trudeau, while even if Trudeau's Liberals don't win an outright majority, it's more than likely that they would still be able to form a minority government with the cooperation of both the NDP and the Greens (who generally are at least able to sit at the same table as the Liberals without puking)."

As markets in Asia are drying up, especially with China, who is applying economic sanctions on Canada over the Huawei affair. Canada must have stronger trade relations with the US and this is especially important to Ontario's and Quebec economies who also hold the balance of power in a federal election. In addition the newly elected conservative government in Ontario with an austerity focus is losing favor with the general population.

While a lot of the outside world loved the idea of Trudeau when he was elected the perception within Canada seems to be far less rosy about the job he's done in office. It seems that playing on a world stage often leaves behind segments of a leader's own country and that lack of focus on internal issues and certain regions of Canada seems like it will hurt him in the fall. While he can definitely recover from some of the issues that have plagued his candidacy, but it seems likely that there will be more fuel added to some of these as it gets closer to the election. I also believe that some of the issues plaguing the Trump presidency in the United States seem to have differing effect by party. Despite the more rigid viewpoints of conservatives it often seems that liberal candidates are hit harder by scandal as there is a certain appeal to high-mindedness inherent to their platforms that give less buffer to absorbing criticism."

Bringing up his predecessor Stephen Harper to highlight his achievements, Trudeau emphasizes that his record includes investment in infrastructure, middle-income tax cuts, and the legalization of recreational marijuana. Although Trudeau has kept some of his campaign promises, there has been push back by federal leaders and Canadians against his plan to impose carbon taxes on provinces. Following this push back and the current SNC-Lavalin scandal he is involved in, his approval rating among Canadian voters has declined to just 40%, which is below President Trumps 43% approval rating, and there have been calls for his resignation.

However, it seems probable that the fervor of these voters may see a decline in the months leading up to the election. In addition, CBC reports that Trudeau has a significant lead over his opponent Andrew Scheer in polls in terms of who Canadians would personally prefer to be the leader of their nation. However, it is important to note that the Liberal Party only has a few point advantage over the Conservative party based on the same polling data. In conclusion, it is likely that Trudeau will remain Prime Minister of Canada, however, the slight likelihood that this could not happen must be taken into account as well."

At first, it seems like they all have an equal chance to win the majority/plurality in parliament. However, for the last two decades, Canadian parliament has been dominated by leftist parties, especially the Liberal Party of Canada. Even with the rise of nationalism globally, it is not likely to have much of an effect in Canada. Trudeau continues to be poplar among Canadian citizens, in part due to the legacy of his father, but mostly due to his leadership and coordination during the last couple of years, especially in areas such as climate change and cyber security. If this were the end of it, my probability would be much lower. However, recently there has been a major scandal among the Canadian political elites. One news sources cites that ""57 percent of Canadians have had their view of Mr. Trudeau tainted by the crisis while 59 percent added the affair will impact who they will vote for in the federal election."" If these numbers are to be believed, then Mr. Trudeau could possibly has some trouble in the upcoming election. Even with this scandal, I still believe that Trudeau will remain in office. His party may not obtain a majority, but I believe that they will retain the plurality."

He’s usually tuned into politics and claims the Tories have a chance of taking in the Liberals (Trudeau). IMO still too early to tell given 9 month window - should become clearer in summer when Canadians emerge from hibernation and better reading on economy (most Canadians blissfully unaware of long term damage Trudeau has caused) which has potential for recession - unusual as it would be out of step with USA which is doing fine (economically).

This Trudeau is dull, vacuous, and has been programmed like a robot by his lead advisor (Gerald Butts) to spout off untruths about diversity, women’s rights, and First Nations (indigenous persons). The reality is there are 3 parties in Canada plus a very weak Green Party led by an inept former communist. Of the three parties, the NDP (primarily socialist) have already crashed and burned with their current leader so unless they get a new leader they will barely register. The Conservatives (think ever so slightly right of centre) are led by a career politician unable to get his point across without speaking like the politician he is...meaning limited connection to people (so far). That leaves Trudeau and Liberals (ever so slightly left of centre). Canadians don’t like too much change. So they are likely to re-elect the former drama (plus math, French and history) teacher despite his not delivering on anything the first time around...except legalizing pot and antagonizing China and Saudi with a holier than thou attitude (which plays well with some segments of population).
