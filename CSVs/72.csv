But if the investigation of The Trump Organization uncovers any personal misconduct (or anything that could be construed as such), you can bet that Trump will wind up being indicted. If he is indicted for tax fraud (which seems the likeliest thing a CFO would have dirt on, and what Weisselberg was convicted on), both NY state and the Feds will want a piece of him; it's unlikely that Trump would have cheated on his taxes for one jurisdiction and played straight with the other.

Rather, it is more like a glorified case of being caught in possession of overdue library books (as president he could access anything and if policies and procedures were not followed by his staff re: securing sensitive materials he had a right to cart around -- how could he be to blame? he would argue). The search warrant allowed the government to get the records back, but indictment for a crime seems unlikely. The prosecutors would want a decent chance at conviction before indicting. There remains the possibility that he will be indicted for some other federal crime, but he seems well insulated in the many sketchy situations he finds himself in. Nevertheless, with at least three federal investigations on-going (one of which involves a federal grand jury) and a 1/6 hearing to resume (in September?), there's a substantial chance that some federal charge could ripen sufficiently for an indictment."
