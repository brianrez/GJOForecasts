What will be the outcome of Hungary's referendum on the European Union's right to set quotas for migrant relocation?,2016-08-31T17:00:01Z,2016-10-01T17:00:16Z,Turnout will not reach 50%,"['Turnout will reach or exceed 50% and a majority will vote ""Yes""', 'Turnout will reach or exceed 50% and a majority will vote ""No""', 'Turnout will not reach 50%']",['Elections and Referenda'],338,654,144,237,"This question was closed on option C ('Turnout will not reach 50%') with a closing date of 1 October 2016. Although over 98% of voters approved the referendum, fewer than 50% of eligible voters participated (The Guardian, NPR, CNN). This is an updated version of previously voided question. For forecasts made on a the prior version see here. A referendum scheduled for 2 October 2016 asks Hungarian voters: ""Do you want to allow the European Union to mandate the resettlement of non-Hungarian citizens to Hungary without the approval of the National Assembly?"" According to Hungarian law, 50% of the population must participate in the referendum for it to be valid (See Article 8, Paragraph 4 of the Hungarian Constitution). For more information on the upcoming referendum see: BBC, Reuters, Bloomberg. Recommended Questions Will more than 1 million refugees and migrants arrive in Europe by sea in 2016? Before 2018, will it be officially announced that any state is withdrawing from the Schengen agreement? Will the EU lift visa requirements for Turkish citizens before the end of 2016?",https://www.gjopen.com/questions/273-what-will-be-the-outcome-of-hungary-s-referendum-on-the-european-union-s-right-to-set-quotas-for-migrant-relocation

In previous referendums in Hungary the turnout has not been nearly as high as in elections and most have failed to achieve the 50%. There seems to be little motivation for voters to bother to go to the polling station. According to The Economist a NO vote that beats a YES vote by a significant percentage sends a clear message to the EU regardless of the turnout being a few percentage points above or below 50%. Getting 75% voting NO on a 40% turnout gets the message across as clearly as getting 60% NO on a 51% turnout. That message is that the EU telling Hungary to accept a fixed number of refugees is not popular in Hungary. It does not appear that getting over 50% would actually trigger anything. The EU plan to direct countries to take refugees is probably already dead."
