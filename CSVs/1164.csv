75003,2019-06-25T17:45:48Z,1,[20.0],[20.0],"In 2018 alone, the stalemate between both Korean states have begun to thaw as their respective leaders, North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-In made history by holding the first summit at the Peace House within the Demilitarized Zone. This summit is known for being symbolic for 1) stating a commitment to denuclearization, and 2) having the Panmunjon Declaration. Since then, 2 other summits have been held between North Korea and South Korea, but the long-awaited visit to Seoul has yet to come to fruition since 2018. It will be a historical moment when the Seoul Summit is held, which must be held for both symbolic and political significance. Plenty of preparatory work must be done between these states, as well as an intention for the Summit to occur. While the possibility of Kim visiting Seoul exists, but there does not seem to be a concerted effort to iron out details of a summit within the next 3 months in general. A few key developments which support the likelihood of Kim's visit to Seoul: the aforementioned 2 inter-state summits between North Korea and South Korea that happened within 6 months of the maiden Peace House Summit all within 2018; most recently Kim's sister -representing the delegate of North Korea- visiting the DMZ to commemorate the death of the former South Korean first lady. These are all symbolic gestures, with the third summit occurring in North Korea's capital, Pyongyang, speaking volumes on a commitment to potentially ending the armistice and declaring the inter-state Korean war to be symbolically over, and potential reunification. These developments give a decent possibility that Kim may visit Seoul eventually. However, thinking that the visit to Seoul occurring before 1st October 2019 seems like a quantum leap to make. Firstly, there has not been a commitment from both countries to work towards the Seoul summit, and given the short timeframe available, it seems highly unlikely. Even if there would be more time available for both countries to work out a schedule, the agenda for the meeting, presumably on honoring the Panmujom Declaration and work towards denuclearization, must happen at the opportune moment. South Korea has been the mediator for the latter commitment towards denuclearization, but seeing how North Korea and the US are still at loggerheads on an agreement between disarmament and lifting embargoes, this author doubts that even South Korea's mediation now would provide an effective solution. Currently, both countries are embroiled in their own political affairs to commit to the Seoul Summit. Kim's international visits now are geared towards securing an ally in China, a potential economic partner and ally who provides a counterweight against the US. And while Moon is expecting a visit from Trump to again be the mediator for talks of nuclear disarmament, he has not augur or make explicit the commitment to a Seoul Summit. They could just as easily meet at another city, or at the Peace House again."

Kim Jong Un’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, met South Korean officials in the demilitarised zone last Wednesday. She expressed her condolences on behalf of North Korea concerning the death of former first lady Lee Hee-Ho. Lee and her husband, former president Kim Dae-Jung, are known for their commitment for a peaceful reunification of both Koreas. Therefore, the act of paying respect should be seen as a symbolic gesture of North Korea to South Korea. Indeed, this represents another step for improved relations between both Koreas. Furthermore, North Korea sent a positive formulated letter to Trump, according to the US president. Trump will be visiting South Korea at the end of June before he departures to the G20 summit in Japan. Indeed, this could be a possibility that Kim Jong Un and Trump will meet in Seoul in order to revive their negotiations as both parties declared their interest to continue these."

While a North Korean delegation might attend the funeral of the former first lady, it remains extremely unlikely that Kim Jong-un should participate and a near visit to Seoul seems unlikely.

The NK leader has recently met Putin, trying to find an alternative ally after having stated aggressive comments against Trump and the not satisfactory Hanoi meeting. As I said in my first forecast, I think that NK will want to get out of the marginalization process in which it is from decades, but it's not ready yet for a reconnection with Seoul neither with the Western countries, preferring old ally as Russia. Indeed, Russia seats at the table of UN security council as permanent member, and for Kim Jong Un could represent a chance to have a voice in the Council and (maybe) reduce the international community sanctions applied to NK. Moreover, after the international conviction to Russia for its intervention in Crimea, Putin might re-acquire some prestige in taking the role of peacemaker, re-connecting with NK and introducing NK issues to the UNSC. For these reasons, I reduce my forecast to 10%"

Even if this event is not completely surprising for the US neither South Korea (this is something going on since long time, and some summits are not enough to guarantee the complete engagement of NK in a peaceful collaboration), surely it is a step back in the de-nuclearization purpose, so much hoped by SK but very unlikely to happen in the short-term. Because of this information and my previous forecast assumptions, I see as even less likely a visit in Seoul by NK president before 1 October (4 months and a half), I decrease the percentage of my forecast.

However, the summit in Vietnam did not end in a signed deal between the US and North Korea mainly due to the request from North Korean side that the exchange for the nuclear program removal should be lifting of all sanctions, not just some. The risk that prevents the US from accepting such step is the risk of North Korea simply freezing the missile program which in itself contains multiple regional and global security risks. And this risk has somehow realized yesterday with news breaking that Kim Jong Un was supervising the first missile test since 2017. It was a solid fuel SRBM with multiple projectiles directed towards Japan signaling the end of the NK's nuclear coma. The response from US was sensitive with Trump insisting in a tweet that a deal between the US and North Korea is possible. A very diplomatic move but also quite mild having in mind the historic account of responses Trump usually takes when it comes to other rogue states or states that do not comply with the American set rules. Therefore, it could be seen that the US is willing to set a deal, however South Korea is concerned according to official statements due to the difference between nuclear freeze and nuclear program dismantle. Therefore, having in mind the now unstable and still evolving activities between the US, North Korea and South Korea, it seems that it is not impossible, but the chances are relatively low in the temporal framework set up by the question. The prospects for Kim Jong Un visiting Seoul after October 2019 are much more optimistic."

Reports do add that it would be enticing for him to go, seeing as he would be the first North Korean leader to visit the South. Additionally, talks with South Korea could also result in more economic stimulation for North Korea. Nonetheless, my very slim probability is due to his recent missile testing activity as of the beginning of May, 2019. Sure, these tests were reported as being short range tests and North Korea is really only restricted by creating long range missiles. But a BBC report noted that North Korea is still working with radioactive material. According to the report, ""The country claims it has developed a nuclear bomb small enough to fit on a long-range missile, as well as ballistic missiles that could potentially reach the mainland US"" (BBC, 4 May 2019). While this isn't really ""new news,"" it still shows that Kim Jong Un is not particularly interested in following US and South Korean demands at the moment and is willing to still ""show off"" what tactics he has to work with."

This comparison is made due to several similarities. First, in both cases former united nations were separated after World War II. Consequently, as a second similarity, both cases share a certain form of system competition with both the BRD and South Korea having won this competition. While North Korea is struggling, both in terms of economical parameters, as well as international standing, South Korea has developed into a stable, mature democracy. As a modern industrial country, it belongs to the countries with higher incomes and is a member of the OECD and G20, among others (https://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/research_papers/2018RP12_hlp_mro_eds.pdf#page=12). Thus, it does not come as a surprise that both cases also share the same refugee movement from east to west and north to south, respectively (https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/nord-und-suedkorea-die-euphorie-ist-der-realitaet-gewichen.724.de.html?dram:article_id=447159). Another crucial similarity touches upon the reconciliation processes or rather attempts. Even though both BRD and South Korean societies were/are majority-wise in favor of the reconciliation, they were/are still divided. Nevertheless, both the BRD and South Korea kept pushing the reconciliation process. Thereby, both reconciliation processes experienced ups and downs ((https://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/research_papers/2018RP12_hlp_mro_eds.pdf#page=12)."

Mr Kim also expressed ""much regret"" that he could not visit Seoul in 2018 (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-46714299).

These kinds of historical events could take place in any day or during symbolic and important recurrencies: june 6 is the memorial day (honoring soldiers and civilians who died for their country), august 15 celebrates the liberation from Japan's occupation, etc (https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/TRV/TV_ENG_1_1.jsp). That said, South Korea is a historical US ally, and it's definetly foreseeable that North-South Korean relations will be influenced by US-North Korea talks about nuclear disarmament (for a way too detailed chronology, see https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/dprkchron whose sum up is that relations are going pretty well, eventhough there's still not a deal about disarmament for releif from economic sanctions). The US-North Korea talks will probably take a while, the issue discussed are very delicate and strictly linked to sovereignty. Taken into account all these factors, I would say that the visit to Seoul is more likely to happen after the first of October, but I don't exclude it either."

Indeed, after nuclear tests in the North, Seoul proposed a meeting on January 9, 2018, which resulted in a North Korean delegation to the Winter Olympic Games in PyeongChang, South Korea, as well as the visit of the North Korean leader's sister, Kim Yo-Jong, first member of the North Dynasty to visit South Korea since 1953."

To meet in Seoul before successfully entering agreements with other countries could be interpreted as a sign of weakness by the SK’s. It would show that Kim is so desperate for allies he is willing to go into what is for all intents and purposes enemy territory (as the Korean war has not officially ended). While it could be interpreted as a sign of goodwill, for a man whose regime is built on a godlike persona, this move would not look good domestically and would weaken the threat of a viable nuclear program, which could impede NK’s international and domestic goals. Unless some major event occurs between the two countries between now and October, I think it is unlikely such a meeting would take place. It may happen later in the future, but given the current state of affairs, it does not seem to benefit Kim enough to take such a step. https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/28/white-house-trump-kim-meetings-change-of-schedule.html https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/u-s-drops-demand-full-accounting-n-korea-nuclear-program-n977251"
