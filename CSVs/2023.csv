Previously, the military shelled YPG targets near the town of Azaz in northern Syria on Feb. 13, under the rules of engagement and in response to two separate attacks carried out by YPG and Assad forces on a Turkish military base and a police station. http://www.dailysabah.com/politics/2016/02/19/turkey-hits-ypgpyd-targets-with-artillery-rockets"

This will make funding more expensive and debt more difficult to repay, thus making Turkey more vulnerable to capital flight, taking into consideration that almost 25% of their bonds are held by foreigners. These eventualities are often precursors to the introduction of the foreign investor’s nemesis – capital controls,” Ren adds."""
