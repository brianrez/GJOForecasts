The incubation period of Corona is can be from 2-24 days and once symptoms begin it typically takes another 2-5 weeks for someone to either recover or die. Two weeks ago Spain only had around 5-6 thousand cases leading one to believe that the apex of the virus has yet to come. Although lockdown and isolation commenced on March 23rd the rate of cases has yet to change and with 85% of Spains population living in or near cities continuous spread is inevitable. One important counterfactual for this prediction if Spain doesn't properly develop and distribute accurate testing kits, the WHO wont be able to confirm cases of Coronavirus."
