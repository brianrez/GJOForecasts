With Clinton expected to repeat her strong showing among minority voters in Southern states, Sanders would need to win large margins over Clinton in Minnesota, Massachusetts, Colorado, and Oklahoma, in addition to his home states of Vermont, where he is predicted to do well. The larger states show the two in a close race, and it would be unlikely for Sanders to pull the wide lead in each needed to catch up with what is expected to be Clinton's wide margins across the south. However, Sanders strong organization resulted in a closer than expected showing in the Nevada caucus, and the caucus system could play to Sanders' advantage in those states.

Sanders is in high favor with the young female demographic, which unfortunately, has not had the highest voter turnout numbers in most recent election years, but is still the most likely source of a large portion of his expected votes.
