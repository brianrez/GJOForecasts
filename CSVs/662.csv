I am assuming this is about border controls only. The issue here is the disparity between the Canadian and US health systems. Canada has a universal health system based on need rather ability to pay. As we are aware the US system is State based, private and based on the ability to pay. A universal system is considered as a part of a socialist doctrine which is an anathema to Americans. This has created an inability to handle the pandemic in the US as opposed to the Canadian model. The Canadians do not want to overwhelm their hospital system with importing further problems from the US, where the pandemic is out of control.

The roll-out in Canada is going well, timely, but they have a different priority list than many U.S. states. They are vaccinating older people more than the U.S. is currently, which means the general population is farther down the priority list. So U.S. general pop. still constitutes a sizable risk group for Canadian gen. pop. Est. timeline for U.S. gen. pop. to get vaccine is end of summer 2021 now, so I think Canada will push opening borders for leisure travel until late summer 2021 at least.

Allowing for logistics of distribution, I guess we might be at 50% vaccination sometime around March, give or take a month. Also assuming some people will maintain some social distancing even with the vaccine, this should put r0 below 1 some time in this time frame. At that point it's a question of how fast the curve drops off and how much political will there is to reopen borders."

The current stats for US Covid 19 and predictions by Dr Fauci et al show no great improvement in infections before the Spring of 2021 so the border will remain closed. If Biden is elected there is more likely to be a significant push to reduce infection numbers and improve public health actions to limit spread. From a strictly Canadian point of view there is absolutely no hurry to open the border for more than essential goods and services.

There is no advantage for Canada to open its borders to non-essential travel from the US and later rather than sooner is probably wise. This could be the second wave of the pandemic, high spike with less deaths due to the increased knowledge of the virus, but there is a potential for four diminishing waves given historical data with a total period of two years (Spanish Flu 1918-1920) and the virus is approximately 11 months old (including the early Chinese experience). Assuming the release of drugs and the possibility of a vaccine in the new year, the first possible date of opening borders would be 1st/2nd Quarter 2021."
