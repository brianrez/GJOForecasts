Arab Bank, PLC, will the Supreme Court rule that aliens can sue a corporation under the Alien Tort Statute?",2017-11-03T17:00:06Z,2018-04-24T17:00:23Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']","['Society', 'US Policy']",352,654,258,237,"In 2015, U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit ruled that the US Alien Tort Statute (ATS) did not permit lawsuits against corporations. In this case, Joseph Jesner and other plaintiffs filed suit against a Jordanian bank for its accused role in terrorist incidents outside of the United States.

Justice Kennedy asked only few questions to Mr. Fischer (Jesner side) and Mr. Fischer felt that was important enough (i.e. that Justice Kennedy was not on his side) to first address Justice Kennedy's question (that by ruling for the plaintiff, the Court would dictate a new norm to corporations, especially foreign corporations, on how to behave). Earlier, I misread the exchange and thought Justice Kennedy would remand (send back to lower court) with instruction that it has to consider other issues, such as the question of extraterritorial nexus. Justice Kagan tried to persuade Justice Kennedy to do that, to leave the door open to sue corporations."

A proficient analysis of this case maybe beyond the scope of my education level, at present. Therefore when making my prediction I merely considered whether or not this case met the standard set forth in the statue that dictates if a party has standing. That standard is as follows; ""Suits can be brought against corporations for involvement in human rights violations abroad, so long as the corporation had sufficient contacts with the U.S., acted together with a government entity or official and had sufficient control over the violations"". First it's known the bank has enough contact with the USA to meet that component of the requirement . Secondly we know it worked with the Palestinian Authority as well as the Israeli government,therefore it worked with a government entity meeting the second component of the standard. And in considering the third component it would be logical to assume that the banks board of directors could surmise the purpose of the monies that it funneled to and from known terrorists.However the banks knowledge that it was a conduit for terrorist activities, isn't indicative that it had any control over the terrorist acts/human rigths violations. Given the criteria It doesn't meet the standard ."

I would assume it's a Great Britain bank, based upon the ""Publicly Limited Company"" designation in its name. If it is a bank with operations in the United States, then what follows is moot."

On the other hand, the Administration wishes to renegotiate historical practices, treaties, and so on. This is a tossup."
