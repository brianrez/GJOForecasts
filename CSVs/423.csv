It's not clear to me that changes in case reporting rules explain most of why cases remain low. There is also a Delta sublineage that may not always be detected by PCR tests and is circulating in at least some locations. Beyond that, it truly makes no sense whatsoever to me that a Delta surge hasn't happened, and I can only surmise that the virus had already made its way through most of the population by the time Delta became dominant, and also, the main respiratory virus season has passed. I hope that Brazil will not see a Delta wave, but I do wonder whether they may simply see a slow one play out over time. The average would need to be >17k/day for the remainder of the forecast for bin 2 to be reached. I don't think that's possible at this point. Brier score destruction!"

If the daily rate of COVID-19 remains the same through 12 November 2021 that will add an additional 458,080 cases to the count.

In order to pass the benchmark of 24,000,000 and reach the next level of prediction, the average number of daily cases would have to immediately increase to 70,498, an increase of 53,724 (420%) and maintain that level throughout the next month. Based on this information, I would place my confidence at 90% that the number remains between 22 and 24 million with a 10% holdout that it could remain below 22 million if Brazil undertakes and sustains a sufficient level of transmission management.. It is far more likely that the number of new daily cases plateaus or even reduces, which is why I have assigned the small possibility (10%) that the number will not reach 22 million. Analyzing data directly from the World Health Organization (WHO) seems to back up the conclusion that new cases, overall, have been decreasing week by week, with the highest rate of week-to-week growth being September 20th at 142, 028 cases (WHO, 2021). Although this also happens to be the highest single week growth rate going back to the start of the pandemic, this information further corroborates my assertion that the likeliest outcome is the number of coronavirus cases in Brazil reaching a level of at least 22 million but fewer than 24 million."

Assuming every person receives 2 doses of vaccine, that's enough to have vaccinated roughly 56% of the population, or about 120,516,365 individuals. Brazil is reporting that this past week, approximately 1,375,916 doses of vaccine were administered. At that rate, it will be 31 more days to vaccinate another 10% of the population or about 21,444,193 individuals. By the end of October a potential 141,960,558 could be vaccinated or 66% of the population. That would leave 72,481,373 unvaccinated. Between now and November 12th, if there are an additional 15,000 new cases daily, this will represent a total of 22,029,546 confirmed cases. If the daily cases spike with the onset of Spring, then using the new cases for September 30th, the total would be 22,145,298 confirmed cases. As of October 7, 2021 WHO reports a total of 21,499,074 confirmed cases.

If I go with the current daily average of 34,452 and multiply it by 54 days, it brings the total of 1,860,408 million people infected. If I add that 54 day total to the already 21,230,325 million people infected, it brings the grand total to 23,090,733 million people infected by November 12,2021. With the Delta-Variant surging in most of the world, it would not surprise me if it goes above my prediction."

Collectively they have added over 150K cases in the past week; ten times the moving average for the whole of Brazil. This may be anomalous, based on back-reporting to catch up on oddly low recent accounts over last week, but shows that this is still open, moving the recent average closer to an expected 18K/day.

Over 90% of recent sequenced cases in São Paolo are Delta, and yet the case numbers are still falling rapidly. Immunity from prior exposure is admittedly very high, and in combination with even a single vaccination dose will create a big defence, but restrictions have been dropped since the beginning of August, and anecdotally restaurants and businesses are busy with unmasked staff and customers. So unless children are being kept indoors or everyone is avoiding everyone else, I don't quite get it. Or maybe everyone has had Covid already, as others have also considered? I suppose the Independence day holiday on Sep 7th may have created a false impression of reduced cases over the last two days, but if case numbers don't rise this week then sub-22m will look like an evens bet."

At this rate of decline of the decline, cases should stop declining within ~2 weeks. At that point, the growth in Delta cases will balance out the decline in non-Delta cases. But because case levels are so high, we know that Delta cases will already be growing quickly, more quickly than non-Delta cases are falling. So we can expect cases to start growing very soon after cases stop falling, in contrast with the long plateaus seen in the UK and the US. And then we will see how fast a Delta wave grows and how big it gets in Brazil. There is huge uncertainty because we really don't know what levels of existing immunity there are, but I do think the Delta wave will be substantial.

We may not see an increase in cases, as Brazil's Delta wave starts, for another month. 20.25M now. Suppose 21.0M by Sept. 12. Then 3M cases could be added in the following 2 months, just as 3M cases were added between June 11 and August 11. That would take Brazil to exactly 24M. If a Delta wave is steeper and/or higher or starts sooner, the total will be >24M. If it's not as steep, is shorter, or starts later, it will be <24M. I'm going to zero out bin 4 for now because I don't think that's plausible right now. But I don't think there's enough information to know whether we'll end up in bin 2 or bin 3. I'll weight bin 2 higher than bin 3 just because the Delta wave could start later than I'm thinking. Sequence data coming out of Brazil is sparse, but what is available at outbreak.info suggests that Delta may be responsible for 2/3 of all cases pretty soon, and that's the threshold at which Delta surges have started in other countries."

Delta will probably cause ~2/3 of all new cases in ~1 to 3 weeks, much sooner than I was initially thinking (thanks to @paulm for making me think about this more), and cases have tended to rise once that threshold is reached. 19.69M total as of July 26, and cases at ~45k/day. Suppose cases continue to fall for another week or so, then plateau for 1 to 2 weeks, then rise. Say, 0.7M cases added in the next 2.5 weeks to Aug. 12. Then 3 months to Nov. 12. How big of a spike will Delta cause in a country that has had almost no mitigation and has a low percentage of the population fully vaccinated, nearly half of which were with a vaccine with low efficacy against infection? If cases rise as steeply as they did in the fall in Brazil, then 3.05M cases could be added in 7 weeks, to reach 19.69M + 0.7M + 3.05M = 23.4M by Sept. 30, with 6 weeks to go. But, if the UK is any guide, that high of a peak may not be reached in Brazil; the UK seems to have reached their Delta peak at ~80% of their fall/winter max. This has probably coincided with close to 100% of the population having developed antibodies to Covid (through vaccination or infection): https://twitter.com/theosanderson/status/1418224366291013652 So, suppose that Brazil does the same. Suppose they reach ~62k/day. Then they might add 1.75M by mid September, to reach ~22.1M by then. Then a symmetric decline could follow, adding another ~1.75M by mid October, to reach 23.9M by then. Another ~0.8M could be added in the remaining 4 weeks to reach a total of 24.7M (with giant error bars). It's also quite possible that a Delta peak in the spring in Brazil could be even lower than ~62k. Spread was slowed in the UK by many restrictions over the course of the pandemic, albeit much less than in many other countries. Brazil had far fewer restrictions than even the UK, from what I can tell. Brazil may end up with a much lower Delta peak."
