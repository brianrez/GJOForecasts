At some point, the curve will turn towards zero, and it's possible that this turn has started. The holiday weekend has obscured trends, but hopefully we will know better what is going on once we have data from June 2 or 3. I choose to base my guess about where the curve will bend based on the example of Israel; if it occurred here at the same case load as in Israel, adjusted for population, it would be at ~11k cases/day. There are various reasons to think it would be different in the US (e.g., slightly higher vaccination rate in Israel would make Israel's numbers lower; later time in spring would make US numbers lower), but it's a start. We will likely be at ~11k/day by June 5 or 6. If cases continue falling linearly past that point, we'll see 50k/week by around June 9 or 10. But it's also possible that there will be an uptick in cases because fewer people are wearing masks or variants are spreading more. We'll soon know."

The subset of US citizens who remain unvaccinated correlates strongly to the subset who refuse to wear masks and social distance. COVID rates among this group have not declined at all since January. There is still plenty of (obstinate, selfish, misguided) tinder for the virus to burn through.

CDC's idiotic waiver of masking mandate for vaccinated will protract breakthrough infections. Variants of Concern, B.1.351 and the newly declared VoC B.1.617.2 are still on the table, they are less likely to be inhibited by at least some vaccines, and will thus protract breakthrough infections and new outbreaks. A dozen of states still have a test positivity rate of >5% Two dozens of states still have a high or very high level of community transmission. And, with the relatively low positity rates in the 75% of the states, the number of tests currently is inappropriately low compared to what it should be to become aware of outbreaks early, and will be forced up, once severe outbreaks will occur (perhaps in CA next). In all, the current figures are likely to understate the risk of higher transmission levels; 7-day new cases are unlikely to fall below 70,000 before 01 July 2021, if not longer..."

Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows more than 980 cases of the variant have so far been detected across 37 states. The second factor, according to the IHME team, is 'increased behaviors that favor COVID-19 transmission.' 'Transmission has been contained over the winter through mask wearing, decreased mobility, and avoidance of high-risk settings such as indoor dining,' the team said. 'As daily case counts decline and vaccination increases, behaviors are likely to change towards increased risk of transmission.'"

Noting that there is vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers and a slowness jn delivering vaccinations due to a limit ln people to do vaccinatipns(why, i don't know). Any way CDC has expanded vaccine eligibility to anyone over the age of 65. This shows that the reports of the slow vaccinations rollout are true and those in charge are trying to catch up by giving the vaccine to anyone who would take it. Interesting to know that Politico report says that healthcare workers who only graduated high school tend to refuse vaccinations those who graduated college tend to take it. On the other hand, it was in charge and now going to at least all the vaccines and Storage and abandon the policy of holding back vaccinations that work to support the second shot. This would effectively mean we are going with a One-Shot regimen for a 2 Shot protocol and it doesn't seem like the FDA review decision. Again this is a move of desperation and the effectiveness of a One-Shot vaccine is going to be less than 90% whether that numbers 80 or 70 I don't know because no one studied it."

The New York times reported on it in the summer. Dr Fachi acknowledged it several months ago. Previously I believe it was believed by the authorities that having false positives was beneficial because it was better to err on the side of caution and it helped to justify stronger lockdowns. Now that the vaccine is being distributed changing the test threshold amounts will help it look like the vaccine is working, restoring public confidence. Florida has recently required its testing centers to report what their cycle thresholds are I believe that this will be a trend among all jurisdictions, which will lead to many fewer positive test results."

As long as the vaccines are proven to be without any substantial side effects, my guess is that the willingness to take it will only increase over time. I've read a little more about the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and it seems to be spreading in a fairly clustered way, fairly different from how influenza spreads, technically that it has a low k value. (https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/09/k-overlooked-variable-driving-pandemic/616548/) I know too little of epidemiology to fully understand how that affects the spread, but it adds another element of chance to the spread which should at least increase the chance of the number of cases staying higher."

96541,2020-12-09T21:38:43Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"Unfortunately I do not believe this is even a remote possibility. The U.S. has not seen case numbers this low since the very beginning of the pandemic. To not go over 50,000 cases over a 7 day period, there would be an average of only 7,142.857 cases per day. According to the WHO, or any site tracking COVID, there hasn't been a 7 day average that low since the week of 9 March (or earlier), and the lowest case rate the U.S. has seen since was still at around 20,000 per day. With the dramatic increase we are about to see, I am not sure we can even get back down to 20,000 a day by then without another shutdown, and that seems unlikely considering the backlash from the last shutdown. I do no believe there will be enough vaccines available to make a dent by then either. I read an article recently that compares the vaccine to a fire hose to stop the spread of the virus. A highly effective Vaccine is a very strong fire hose. However, with the extremely high case rate we are seeing, we are taking a strong fire hose to fight the country's worst forest fire ever by comparison. If we had lower case rates, meaning it was just a small fire to put out, it would be a lot easier to see cases go down by then. Before the vaccine can be effective, we would need enough doses to vaccinate the majority of the population at the same time, or we would need a lower case rate and a good rate of vaccinations in areas where the cases are most prevalent. If the time frame were longer, say 15 December, I would have more faith in the vaccine helping to get case numbers that far down. However, our lowest case rate over a 7 day period since 9 March occurred during the week of 25 May, with an average case rate of 20,205 cases per day. The U.S. was nowhere near the case rate it is at now when the downward curve began, since the highest weekly rate was 219,073 in April before going down. We are seeing that many cases per day right now. The average case rate per week since 2 November in the U.S. is 1,047,842 new cases, and this includes the week of 2 November, which had 684,493 new cases according to the WHO. Without that week, the U.S. averaged 1,138,679 new cases per week during the last four weeks, and last week was 1,251,632 new cases in 7 days. It takes weeks to get the case numbers down after a surge that is significantly smaller than what we are seeing now, so who knows how long the current surge will effect us. The worst two months are yet to come, and I do not see it improving so drastically after spring comes that we see case numbers drop to about a third of what they were at our lowest case rate since the beginning of the pandemic. I hope I am wrong, but the math doesn't add up in our favor."

This could either happen through herd immunity (through immunization or people already having had COVID-19) and through fast detection and isolation of those who are contagious. Using data from Stockholm, Sweden it seems that about 10% of those infected are detected, which would give that there are already 140 million infected in the US. On the other hand - with an estimated death rate of .6% the total number of infected would be 46 million. I think 46 million is more certain so let's estimate the number to a weighted average 1/3 - 2/3, giving 77 million in the beginning of December. This doubling to 154 million by the beginning of June is not unreasonable. Regarding vaccines - I haven't seen a lot of numbers for 2021, but this article https://www.businessinsider.com/when-can-i-get-a-coronavirus-vaccine-timeline-2020-11?r=US&IR=T, mentions 30 million vaccines/ month in the beginning of the year (unclear if this is doses which would imply that the number treatments is half). Let's assume 15 million per month every month including May, which is 75 million people having been vaccinated by June 1. This would mean that 154+75 = 229 million could be immune. Of course some people who have already had the disease will receive the vaccine lowering this number say to 154+37.5=191.5. According to Herd immunity is believed to be reached when 60-80% of the population is immune (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/13/the-death-toll-would-be-enormous-fauci-says-of-herd-immunity-to-coronavirus-in-the-us.html). 191.5 million is 58% of the US population so almost within the herd immunity range. However, Fauci has said that he thinks it is possible that an ""overwhelming majority"" of the US population could be vaccinated by the end of June 2021, https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/528247-fauci-says-us-could-have-heard-immunity-by-end-of-summer-2021. In addition to this faster and more widespread testing would make tracing and isolating new cases easier. The main risk in this is associated with the vaccination program - failure in distribution, failure in uptake in general population and failure in the safety or efficiency of the vaccine. The number 50k/ week is also so low that the situation could be under control overall, but with localized outbreaks. My estimate of the number of people already infected could also be off and contagion suppression measures in the beginning of next year could slow down the spread reducing the number of already infected."

The US is unlikely to institute strict lockdown regardless of the party in charge of the executive branch. The US is also likely to see increased daily rates as people gather for the holidays and testing capability continues to increase. The winter weather will also cause a large percentage of the country to favor indoor settings to outdoors, increasing risk of transmission.

The patient had two positive tests for SARS-CoV-2, the first on April 18, 2020, and the second on June 5, 2020, separated by two negative tests done during follow-up in May, 2020. Genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 showed genetically significant differences between each variant associated with each instance of infection. The second infection was symptomatically more severe than the first. https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30764-7/fulltext"

Masks and social distance will be strongly adhered to and with demonstrated effect, the daily rate will rapidly decrease."

The big factors making that possible would be immunity due to spread of the virus and immunity due to a vaccine, which I would think would be fairly prevalent by then. Another could be measures taken by a president Biden, such as mask mandates or a more aggressive test and trace program. Factors making it unlikely are low seroprevalence (just briefly googling around it still looks like estimates put the country as a whole as less than 10% having antibodies) and low vaccine usage (some surveys indicate only 50% or so of the population might get it) and just the data we have for spread of the virus in the US to date."
