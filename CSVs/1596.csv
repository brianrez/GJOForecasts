Outcome will be determined by the ""Realtime [Month of Interest] All Africa File"" found on the Realtime Data page. The count of battle deaths for the period of interest is obtained by summing the 'FATALITIES' column for events in which the 'COUNTRY' is the country of interest; 'EVENT_TYPE' is Battle-Government regains territory, Battle-No change of territory, or Battle-Non-state actor overtakes territory; and 'EVENT_DATE' falls in the period of interest.
