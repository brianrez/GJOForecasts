Assuming the final legislation requires a simple majority, the odds are very good it'll get through final vote. Uncertainty: There are several aspects of the bill that are still hotly contested. Here's a NZ Natl Party speech that sums them up (https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_91272/tab/video).

Furthermore, Gun legislation has become something of a point of pride in New Zealand because of the quick action taken by the government in 2019. The only reason I predict this outcome as under 70% is because of the speed of the actions taken in 2019 and the issues this caused (specifically with the buyback program). Throughout New Zealand history there have been multiple registries that were less encompassing then the one proposed. I believe the government will choose to roll out this act slower and more completely. They may have it prepared by March but they may wait to begin implementation past the anniversary."

So I'll un-extremize this base rate a bit to account for that uncertainty, and say perhaps 80% of total countries have similar registries, which would be the base rate if 50% of the unaccounted for countries had gun registries (if I had more time I could do this properly)."

New Zealand’s political system can allow for rapid passage of legislation, e.g., the initial measures after the Christchurch attacks. The one year anniversary of those attacks could be a symbolic deadline, yet the passage of time without progress on this effort suggests momentum for reform is lagging. Struggled to find an analogous base rate for something as specific as a national registry following gun attacks given that initial reforms have already been implemented; registration requirements are very common globally, and vary in the specifics."
