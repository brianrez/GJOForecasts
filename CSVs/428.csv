Most consumers in that segment are focused on shorter trips. The rate of increase of public charging stations just doesn't look high enough to get us to 321 by November. It's also worth noting that chargers installed in supermarket carparks don't appear in the Waka Kotahi list (even though there are lots of them) presumably because they don't meet the agency criteria. That is important because that is a major area where consumer demand will drive more installations and they could be included in the future through a change to Waka Kotahi's policy, which would lead to a sudden increase in the numbers reported by Waka Kotahi."

My thinking is that though there are lots planned across cities which should take listed stations over 321, EVRoam has been active for some years though does not often update (only 1 new station since 31 March) and acknowledges as of 7 July only 1 under construction. PlugShare too acknowledges only a few as planned or under construction. One city council won't even decide on an installer until about the end of August. I think 30 new listed stations over the next 3 1/2 months is very unlikely. I initially though of a prediction in the 3-8% range, but because there is a risk that there may be a wave of updates on the site and or rapid installation of new charging stations I'll start at about 23%. Watching for both announcements on installation, acknowledgement of those planned, and updates on the site."

Any other growth will be private companies and therefore don't meet guidelines for this system."
