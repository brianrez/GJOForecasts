I have no math to back this - just a sense that I observe a willingness of Draghi (and successor) to go back to QE, and the trillions of now-negative yielding sovereign debt. That is big pressure onto the spread as interest rates return to being crushed. institutional money has to chase positive yield wherever they can find it - and either sign up for the vagaries of EM debt, or stay with the known-unknowns like Italian debt - which seems about right for the many. This lid on the spread, in the immediate term, considers both the possibility of larger-than-permitted fiscal deficits and the possible breakup of the coalition government, and the ascension of the League."
