Indicates to me they have a nonzero chance of success in court. Craig's lawsuit is in the Michigan court of claims, although I can't find the text of the suit (may not be public). Court of claims is also split 2-2 GOP/Dem appointees, so it's kind of 50-50 which judge gets this case, unless they do it en banc. Michigan supreme court appears to have a 4-3 Democratic majority at the moment so it's hard to see the case succeeding there. Possible there would be a federal challenge also, and the federal 6th circuit is GOP dominated, but I can't find any news reports of a federal suit, so I'm guessing that would have to follow a failure at state court, and probably not at all."

The Republican vote could end up split between an official party candidate that few are excited about and one or even two major write-in candidates. I can't see how a write-in candidate could realistically win, because it would be hard to get all the voters they need to remember and accurately write a specific name, and some voters will just vote straight ticket, which is offered in Michigan (i.e., voting for all the members of one party on a ballot by marking only one box on the ballot). There will be legal challenges, but I just can't see those working, either. What do they want the courts to say - ""oh, we're so sorry the people you hired forged signatures! That wasn't fair. Sure, you can be on the ballot, and we'll just waive the rules for you""? So, I’m increasing my forecast for a Democratic victory for now, but I’m also leaving room for the situation to change."

Craig and Johnson were 2 of the most important Republican candidates, and they are both now probably off the ballot entirely. At least Craig and Johnson have said they will mount legal challenges, but I don't see how they can win, unless election law is thrown away. 19 candidates for various positions didn't submit the minimum required number of signatures, so they're off the ballot.

But I've been putting a bit more weight on Trafalgar polls recently, and they have the R challenger up 6 in a poll from September. Too early to put much weight on that, but I am putting some weight on it. Also since Whitmer is the incumbent that will help her a bit. This one feels kind of like a tossup, and I give the slight advantage to R for now."
