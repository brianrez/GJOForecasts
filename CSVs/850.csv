China’s defence budget, merely double Taiwan’s at the end of the 1990s, is now 25 times greater ... American intelligence officials do not think that China is about to unleash this firepower.

A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be bloody and expensive, but they would ignore a backlash if it consisted only of rhetoric and would shrug off International isolation as the world cannot distance itself from China economically (yet). Xi Jinping has indicated his impatience to resolve the Taiwan issue. The resolve of the US would be tested as to react militarily could lead to war and to ignore it would be to accept the authority of the Chinese. Both dangerous. A precursor to military action would be heightened cyberattacks on the institutions of Taiwan and China has been increasing those. Hong Kong has been subjugated and Taiwan remains the last piece to make China, one.

At a rare press conference called on Thursday night, Taiwan’s defence ministry said almost two dozen Chinese military aircraft and seven naval ships had operated between 7am and noon on Wednesday and Thursday in an area between Pratas, a Taiwan-controlled atoll in the South China Sea, and Taiwan’s south-western coast ... The drill confirms concerns in Taipei that the People’s Liberation Army would ratchet up military pressure closer to Taiwan’s borders once the coronavirus crisis receded in China. A Taiwanese former senior military officer said the Chinese move was the most serious threat to Taiwan’s security since 1996, when Beijing fired missiles into waters just north and south of Taiwan."" https://www.ft.com/content/9bf1c039-3222-4aa7-be37-6f01afc41ef2"

His recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and meeting with Kim Jong Un show a capacity for shock moves like this. Unfortunately this could easily spiral out of control due to his lack of nuanced understanding of the regional politics; China is a pragmatic police state with a long term view and no apparent appetite for conflict but this would represent a line that could not be crossed without retaliation.

No advantage to Taiwan who have been preparing for invasion for the last 70 years against overwhelming odds. Both sides are armed with first class weaponry. China wants to regain Taiwan into the authority of the mainland for two reasons: a) China’s determination that Taiwan is a part of and belongs to the mainland and b) China does want a militarised island lying off its coast with and supported by potential enemies. A military solution to Chinese demands would prove to be expensive both in lives and economics and localised skirmish resulting in a lethal outcome would not be helpful. A dispute involving fishing boats is assumed to not involve the military. A more likely scenario would be a cyber war attacking Taiwan’s systems of government, industry and business with an emphasis on persuading the populace of its errors would provide a non-lethal battle. Given the sensitivity and volatility of the region, a legal confrontation is unlikely as great care will be taken to avoid any accidental outbreaks. Therefore, avoiding 0% as a possibility, I propose 5% chance of a lethal outbreak before 15th December 2020."

However this proves more difficult since a sea is separating the countries and Taiwan is not associated strongly with China. Economic pressure will be their way of choice probably as it already is.
