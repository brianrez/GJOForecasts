London has around 2,000 case per day and a population of less than 9 million and is hosting the Euro 2020 tournament with large crowds allowed as well (whereas the Olympics will have no visiting crowds, and its unclear if any crowds will be allowed). Obviously these are not perfect comparisons as the Olympics brings together people from a wide variety of countries which presents more risk, but an IOC spokesperson said that ""well above"" 80% of residents of the Olympic and Paralympic Village in Tokyo will be vaccinated as well as around 80% of the media, which seems to mitigate this risk. Finally, the head of Japan's Olympics organizing committee ruled out a few weeks ago another suspension of the games (especially driven by the massive cost delaying the games had). Now that there are only about two weeks until the games are set to begin, it might be possible that all spectators will be banned but it is unlikely that the games are suspended/move as a whole."

Such limits and planning would likely not occur if there were concrete plans to cancel the Olympics, suggesting that the officials have essentially reached the decision to go forward with the games. Public sentiment is also pushing forward, as articles now talk about the precautions being taken going into the games rather than the unrest in Japan as articles features a weeks earlier.

However, an official announcement appears unlikely with the commencement of the Olympics planned for next month and with Pfizer and BioNTech making agreements to vaccinate athletes.

As the stance of the IOC has been very strong (https://deadline.com/2021/05/tokyo-olympics-japan-will-be-held-state-of-emergency-ioc-1234762448/), with seemingly little to no consideration of cancelling the Games, it seems unlikely that a reversal in position will occur by mid-July (or earlier) especially if this decision -- ""IOC officials have previously set an end-of-June deadline for a decision on continuing with the Games"" (Deadline) -- is still true.

For example, the IOC is notoriously ruthless with corporate sponsorships, TV deals, and quid pro quo dealings with a variety of nations. On the other hand, you have the Japanese public, which is understandably resistant to an influx of ~6000 athletes and the thousands more coaches, administrators, media personnel that will follow. Finally, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has been facing a series of public criticism over his refusal to cancel the games. Fundamentally, the 7 day moving average of new cases in Tokyo is down 60% from a local max in early May, when many of the polls were taken. If we estimate this average decreases about 10 per day with a standard deviation of about 5 , then we can model this as a summation of roughly 50 (number of days) normal variables. Then we suppose correlation for consecutive days is about 75%. This means our summation (i.e. total change from now until the games) is distributed as N(-500, 5^2 * 50 + 2 * .75 * 50) = N(-500, 1325). If we assume that we need to reach early May levels for the games of having a 75% chance of being cancelled, then we can upper bound this as .75 * 10% (doubling our probability to account for fatter tails) to get a final answer of about 7."
101321,2021-06-10T05:38:14Z,1,[6.0],[6.0],"1. Referring to historical precedent, only five modern Olympics have ever been cancelled, either due to WWI or WWII (interestingly enough, Japan 1940 was one of the cancelled Olympics) - fifty-one games have been successfully hosted. By this calculation, there is a naïve ~9% probability of an Olympics being cancelled. 2. Since the pandemic is still ongoing, with many of its adverse effects still being felt (for instance, restricted travel between countries, increased suspicion of immigrants, reshaping/disruption of supply chains, changing power dynamics [via vaccine diplomacy], etc.), the probability of cancellation in 2021 is higher than any other non-pandemic/non-war year (i.e., if we condition on the existence of a ""global disruptor,"" then the probability of 9% would be an underestimate). Instead, we must consider the years for which a large ongoing conflict was co-occurring with an Olympic games. Referring to a list from Britannica, it appears that there were approximately 50 Olympic games that would have occurred during an ongoing conflict. For simplicity, we will assume approximately half of these conflicts would have not affected the host country and/or major participating countries. This means we have an updated probability of ~16% of cancellation. 3. Moving to specific concerns in 2021, Japan has been faced with numerous challenges including 10000 volunteers who have recently pulled out of the games and intensely negative domestic sentiment towards the games. The first logistical challenge is offset by a reduced Olympic village and the presence of very few if any in-person spectators: there are less volunteers but also a lesser need for volunteers. The second issue is a bit more complicated to untangle. If we refer to surveys from 2020 around the time of the postponement, roughly 33.7% of survey respondents believed that the Olympics should be cancelled. Recent 2021 surveys have shown this number rise to around 40%. Given the upcoming parliamentary elections, negative sentiment could be political kindling for opponents of the current administration so perhaps an increase in the probability is warranted - arbitrarily let's say there is now a 21% of cancellation. 4. Unfortunately, the sentiment of the Japanese citizens may not be too important in our calculation. As others have previously mentioned, the Olympics can ultimately only be cancelled by the IOC. Beyond this argument of irrelevancy, we also have to consider the fact that a successful Olympics (which should be defined as an event which has little Covid transmission, demonstrates Japan's competence, and generates commercial interest) will boost the profile of the current administration whereas cancelling the games will likely not have the same magnitude of positive sentiment. At the same time, the long-term perception of Japan may be affected if the Beijing 2022 Olympics proceed just six months later, i.e., geopolitical tensions in the area may motivate Japan holding the event. So we can return to a probability of 16% and actually decrease it a bit to - let's say 12%. 5. Instead, we should consider the sentiment that actually matters to the IOC: those of participating countries. As of now, only North Korea has withdrawn from the games (in early April). This is in contrast to March of 2020 when several countries including Canada and Australia withdrew from the games which ultimately preceded the postponement announcement - Olympic committees from several countries had also voiced concern in 2020. From some cursory searches, I did not find evidence of similar statements being made. This suggests that the international sentiment - and specifically the sentiment of the IOC's constituent committees is in favor of proceeding with the games. We can therefore further reduce the probability (again, perhaps arbitrarily) by half down to 6%. 6. Profitability is the ultimate deciding factor for the IOC in these games. In the most recent games, 73-75% of revenue was from broadcasting. Viewership figures are a bit unclear (they are broadly up, but not necessarily in the avenues that the Olympics will be broadcast and advertising as a whole has decreased). One thing we can consider are similar events to the Olympics and their relative performance. For instance, despite increased time at home, the 2021 Oscars had a record lower viewership (this can also be attributed to the fact that movie theaters were closed during the pandemic), and the 2021 NBA viewership has also not recovered to a substantial extent (aside from blockbuster matches). These events are US-centric and one potential event that could be used to extrapolate Olympic figures is the Copa America which has faced similar issues as the Olympics as a large sporting event. Depending on how Copa America precedes (begins on June 13), the IOC may consider revising their approach. Specifically, if viewership numbers are depressed and the event sees high rates of Covid transmission, the IOC may be more likely to postpone or cancel. As such, this prediction should be updated to reflect new information after the first few days of the Copa America. As it currently stands, there is an 6% chance the games will not commence in July 2021."
101289,2021-06-10T04:45:35Z,1,[3.0],[3.0],"The extent of the preparations for the olympics can be seen on the website, including detailed schedules and timetables. At least one group of athletes has already arrived in Japan ahead of time to prepare before moving into the olympic COVID bubble (Australian softball team). With all of these developments in place, July 15 being so soon (5 weeks away), and the positive direction of the world's road towards recovery from COVID, I believe it is highly unlikely that the olympics will reverse course before July 15."
101312,2021-06-10T04:37:47Z,1,[6.0],[6.0],"The debate over cancellation thus far has largely been the International Olympic Committee against the Japanese public, with the Japanese government offering few words of support for either side. Legally, only the IOC can officially cancel the games, and given their present steadfastness in the face of public pressure, there is little reason to believe they will cave in before July 15. I would rate this probability at 5%. A situation in which the Japanese government defies the IOC and unilaterally ""announces"" the cancellation of the Olympics also seems plausible, and I would rate this probability at 1%, seeing that 1) it would be an extreme measure, not characteristic of diplomatic and deliberate Japan, and 2), the Japanese government does not seem to cave into public pressure often."
101293,2021-06-10T04:27:43Z,1,[3.0],[3.0],"The IOC has been adamant about going forward with the Olympic games, and it is only a month before the games now, with no indication of the IOC budging on their opinion. Furthermore, coronavirus cases have been falling in Japan from a peak in May, which reduces fears. Furthermore, even with COVID in Japan, it is still possible for the Olympics to be conducted in a bubble-style, similar to how the NBA tournament was held in 2020. Overall, the pressures against cancelling are very high, and things are getting better in Japan, so I predict that most likely the Olympics will commence as planned."
101274,2021-06-10T04:18:46Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"Preparation for the summer olympics are already underway, with many roads being blocked off, signaling that the IOC is intent on moving forward with the current schedule. Although there is much public opposition to the olympic games and the low number of Japanese residents that have received a vaccine dose, the IOC seems confident in its ability to deliver a safe experience for viewers, journalists, and athletes. There will be frequent testing required and many rules in place to prevent the spread of COVID, and unless there is another significant wave of a new strain of the virus, the IOC is intent on having the summer olympics this year. With the start of the olympics quickly approaching and the number of preparations that are already underway, it would take a significant outbreak and change in the pandemic situation to incite another postponement. The probability of such a thing happening isn't insignificant, and since the pandemic status is constantly changing, I think there is a 10 percent chance of this happening."
101313,2021-06-10T04:00:25Z,1,[4.0],[4.0],"The Olympics have never been postponed before Tokyo 2020 and have only been cancelled 3 times out of 51 (5.9% of the time) due to both World Wars, though an international pandemic is clearly not the same as an international conflict of violence. After already postponing once, it would be unwise to postpone again this close to the anticipated commencement. Doing so would also have some nontrivial impacts on the economic and financial implications on the Japanese economy. It would also seem to go against the beliefs of Japan's Head of Government Yoshihide Suga. From a health-oriented point of view, Japan has been handling COVID19 much better since its second spike in mid-May, with just barely over 2000 new cases as of June 6, 2021."
101273,2021-06-10T03:56:50Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"Let us first use the USA as a baseline for when sporting events will start opening up to the public, at least at a limited capacity (which is for our purposes, similar to Japan only allowing Japanese citizens to attend the Olympic games). It can be seen that the NBA opened limited capacity around march 30, for when the 7-day moving average was about 65000 for new cases. Scaling this down to Japan's population and dividing by a factor of 2 just to gain a lower bound, we would need to have a 7-day average of about 14.4k cases in Japan for the games to not be cancelled from this perspective, which is barely the upper bound of the number of cases by the time the games begin according to healthdata. Even when building our own model of the number of cases by empirically determining the parameters of some gaussian distribution to forecast future projections (and repeating it for, say 100 times to gain a 95% confidence interval similar to @zsekaran's) it will, only in rare circumstances, increase to levels deemed unfit for in-person attendance for the Olympics. There are also special efforts made by the IOC to make sure that the games do happen, and other sporting events in nations with similar epidemic rates are still hosting."
101279,2021-06-10T03:48:46Z,1,[3.0],[3.0],"Currently there appears to be heavy pressure within Japan to cancel the games due to concern over the safety of the athletes. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, currently both Japan and the IOC (International Olympic Committee) insist the games are a go. With the games commencing in less than a month, this gives strong confidence that the games will commence. However, to even better understand whether or not the games must be cancelled, we must look at who is capable of cancelling the Olympic Games, what conditions/penalties are incurred for cancelling the games, and what forces would push the entity to cancel the games."
101319,2021-06-10T03:41:11Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"I think it is very unlikely the Olympics are cancelled because it would be a huge boost to Japan's economy, which like many other countries has been hit had by the pandemic. However, I allow for some chance since Japan does not have high vaccination rates right now. Instead of full cancellation, Japan may just impose restrictions on the games."
101307,2021-06-10T03:09:16Z,1,[8.0],[8.0],"The primary reasons that I could see Japan not holding the Olympics this year would be because A) only a small percentage of the Japanese population is fully vaccinated, and B) mounting pressure from athletes and the public to postpone the event."
101286,2021-06-10T03:02:18Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"Given that that July 15 is just about a month away, it would take pretty drastic events to cause Japan to cancel/postpone the Olympics. However, Japan has a very low vaccination rate, which means that an outbreak is still not out of the question. Even still, most athletes will be vaccinated and ready to compete, so I don't see this as a highly likely scenario. Furthermore, a second cancellation would likely turn into a full cancellation, which makes a second delay seem quite unlikely."
101314,2021-06-10T02:46:36Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"The factors in determining the state of the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics are: the Coronavirus status in Japan, vaccine availability, international flight safety, communications from the IOC, the local sentiment, and WHO sentiment. We should also consider the IOC's behavior during the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics during March 2020 and see the similarities and differences to now."
101315,2021-06-10T02:33:22Z,1,[9.0],[9.0],"Declining Tokyo infection rates, the continuation of work in the city to prepare for the games, sunk cost rationale from the Japanese government, and strong economic pressures from broadcasters and sponsors seem very likely to outweigh concerns of Japanese citizens. Additionally, as the date of the games approaches, the bigger the impact of cancelling them would be, so each day that passes implies a lower probability that a cancellation would actually occur."
101297,2021-06-10T02:31:56Z,1,[2.0],[2.0],"Japan faces some financial pressures, such as a possible loss of over 20 billion dollars, that will likely lead them to host the games in 2021, even if they do not want to host it this year. On a similar note, cancelation would require action from the IOC, who would likely avoid postponing revenue for another year and competing with itself by hosting winter and summer Olympics in the same year. Similarly, merchandise has already been made and kept for ""Tokyo 2020"" and further delays would only reduce the value of this merchandise, something that the IOC would want to avoid."
101303,2021-06-09T23:28:21Z,1,[8.0],[8.0],"Clause 66 gives reasons for which the Olympics would be cancelled, of which the primary relevant one is if the IOC ""has reasonable grounds to believe...that the safety of participants in the Games would be seriously threatened or jeopardized for any reason whatsoever"". Although the IOC has stated that a second postponement is unfeasible, and the minister in charge of Japan's vaccination drive has stated that they will ""hold the Games in a way that is feasible"", there still does seem to be an argument for postponement of the games. In particular, the vaccination rate in Japan is slow, with less than 1% of the population being fully vaccinated, and access to the vaccine is extremely limited, even for healthcare workers and other high risk populations. The majority of Japanese citizens support a cancellation or postponement of the Olympics, and prominent athletes, such as Naomi Osaka, have also spoken about the risk to athletes, especially the concern if they do not feel safe. Despite these concerns, I do not think that the IOC will move to cancel the Olympics. Covid concerns can be greatly mitigated by preventing spectators, and having the athletes quarantined and possibly vaccinated. Furthermore, the costs of postponement or cancellation run upwards of $15 billion, which would be a huge blow to the IOC and to the Japanese economy. Lastly, the vice president of the IOC stated that the Olympics would be held starting July even if Tokyo remained under a state of emergency. This strong stance from the IOC leads me to believe that they are highly unlikely to go through with a second postponement, although the possibility is still very real."

Furthermore, Japan stands to lose $30 billion if they do not hold the Olympics. I think both of these multiply to a low probability of about 4%."
101300,2021-06-09T19:08:57Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"To cancel the Olympics, either the IOC or Japan's government would need to react. IOC derives its entire budget from the games, and with the winter games already planned, it's unlikely they are willing to cancel (articles say not even consideration for them). Japan government recently rejected a petition to cancel, and stands to lose up to 30 billion dollars. Despite majority of citizens not wanting the games, the government is unlikely to take action due to the economics. Thus, I believe there's only a 5% chance of cancellation, accounting for extreme citizen uprising or governmental radical shift. With more vaccines being available, the overall risk is low. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-57097853"
101296,2021-06-09T18:46:03Z,1,[8.0],[8.0],"There are definitely a few factors that could cause the games to be rescheduled. First, it seems unlikely that there will be international visitors which means that Japan will not receive much of the revenue that a country normally gets for hosting the Olympics. Second, a lot of the Japanese population (80% per WSJ) seems that they are against hosting the Olympic games, including some people higher up in the government such as former Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama. Finally, the biggest issue is that much of the Japanese population is not vaccinated and they are getting vaccinated at a slower rate than expected. I think that this is one of the biggest issues because this was not expected when the 2021 Olympics were being planned. That being said, I do think that this will have a large enough effect to make a significant difference and it is unlikely that it would be cancelled overall."
101282,2021-06-09T17:36:18Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"I think the initial tendency here is to go very low with my forecast -- after all, last year the Olympics were postponed in March; it is now June. Considering how soon they are coming up, I think it is unlikely (and will be increasingly unlikely) that they will be cancelled given the resources that have gone into planning them. However, I also think there is a tendency to underestimate the chances here by taking an America-centric view and purely considering the state of COVID/re-openings/sports in America without giving proper credence to the fact that other countries are struggling much more heavily with (and therefore are more cautious about) COVID. That raises my probability a little bit."

There is also significant pressure from stakeholders for the games to proceed. According to a poll conducted in March 2021, 59% of respondents were in not in favour of holding the Games in the midst of a pandemic, 30% supporting the event. The polls seem to vary dependent on the reporting but showing a trend to postpone/cancel. Toshihiro Nikai, the Secretary General of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party suggested that the Games could be cancelled dependent on control of the pandemic, but this was quickly backtracked by him with the Prime Minister, Yoshihide Suga signalling a no- change attitude in the Government indicating perhaps a level of discussion being held as to a cancellation. The British Medical Association have advised against holding the Games, given Japan’s poor record in controlling the virus. Pressure may be relieved (at a significant loss of income) in that there will no spectators. Foreigners will almost certainly will prohibited from entering the country. The participants in the Games will be subject to a regime of testing and social distancing by their home organisations and the IOC. The World Athletes President, Sebastian Coe believes the Games will proceed given the testing regimes he experienced at a half marathon test event in Sapporo this month. From the Stakeholders point of view, the official Japanese budget of $15 Billion has climbed to $26 Billion and rising. This would be written down as a loss if the games if the Games were cancelled. The IOC who are the owners of the Games are determined for the Games to proceed to protect the 73% of their income by way of broadcasting rights. It is reported that Japanese companies have paid some $3 billion in sponsorship deals with International broadcasters spending significant amounts (NBC paying $1.4 billion for rights). The Games are the exclusive property of the IOC and only they can terminate the contract between them and the host city of Tokyo. The IOC does have an obligation to the health of the athletes and could cancel if this was threatened (a case could be made here due to the pandemic). Should Tokyo unilaterally pull out, the organising committee would be responsible for all risks and losses. There is also a symbolic significance as the Games would show a revival of Japan post Fukushima and Tsunami according to Professor Jack Anderson at the University of Melbourne."

Since, I have puzzled over why the Olympic Committee was ploughing ahead with their schedule. What models had the Olympic Committee used to make their incredibly optimistic decision that the world would be 'normal' again in July 2021? I can understand why the Olympic Committee wants to go ahead wit the Games (given the resources at stake), but the risk it poses to the world economies is too great. Imagine an outbreak in the Olympic village that isn't realised until AFTER the athletes and their support crews have returned to all the corners of the world from where they came.

Will it be a beacon of hope in what have been dark times? Should it be cancelled is maybe a different proposition to will it be cancelled. Could it be managed safely? Small numbers of athletes, no crowds. Is there the political will? The sponsorship deals? The pride at stake? Will the emotional commitment and desire to see it outweigh the practicalities? Will it end up just being an event for the richer vaccinate countries? Probably will go ahead but situation could change quickly."

Only the IOC can cancel the games and they won't face any of the public pressure from the public like the government does.

I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that Japan has a pretty high median age. Also they don't have a problem with malaria so typically don't use Hydroxychloroquine.
