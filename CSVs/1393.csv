I also can't tell if the Justice Department would circulate a memo like this to prompt reaction from gun sellers and law enforcement agencies (since the article says an ATF spokepeson claims they're still considering comments from the public period this last summer) or if they've delayed posting the final rule to give sellers and law enforcement time to prepare for mad chaos when the rule is proposed and people get angry. If the thread is anything to go by and there is still only a 5% expectation that this will go through by the end of the year, maybe this one will end up being a bit of a shock. On the other hand, it makes sense, given the economic significance and the fact that both gun sellers and law enforcement will need to prepare for next steps. So the final publishing seems to me to be pretty firmly set, still actively in the process on many levels, but not clear when it will be finalized in the Federal Register. Still, it seems to me moving ahead and therefore more likely to be published within 1-2 weeks than that it will be delayed having already reached everything but final sign off."

While a legislative ban is highly unlikely, it is likely that the DOJ will regulate bump stocks. Trump has made an announcement earlier this month stating that bump stocks would be banned over the next few weeks. There was a public comment period on the ban of bump-stocks earlier this year, which is required for one of the routes to publishing a significant regulation through the DOJ. The DOJ did publish a proposed regulation on the Federal Register, sought public comment, and it has been confirmed that this regulation has been sent to the Office of Management and Budget for review, the final step in the process. It likely will not be officially a new regulation or be announced to be implemented until after the midterm elections, but it will likely happen before January 1st. https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/justice-department-proposes-banning-bump-stocks/ https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/01/politics/trump-bump-fire-stocks/index.html"

Crucially, the DOJ has indicated that ""final action"" (to me the most likely interpretation is that final action means ""pass on to OMB for review"") will take place on 09/00/18. I interpret ""00"" to mean ""by the end of the month"" based on a looking around at different federal rules and their announced and actual dates."
37488,2018-08-20T13:04:04Z,2,[20.0],[15.0],"I'm increasing my guess for now based on the ATF's published schedule and the fact that I haven't yet any announcement or action that would suggest delays because of the results of the review of the comments from the public comment period or the opposition paperwork filed on behalf of the FPC and FPF. I hate going against such a strong trend, but since this is an Executive office directive to an executive branch federal agency, I think it doesn't matter much what Congress thinks about it. To block it, they can have to get votes in both the House and Senate to make it fail, and even with such a politically divisive issue that could spur on party action during midterm elections, I don't think Republicans will want to block it, both because it has general public support even among some conservatives and because it goes against the President (who may not care much about the issue but generally seems to care about looking foolish or weak). The agency processes have been started and, although there are ways to scuttle the rule in process, they're not ones that seem very likely. Delays seem more likely to be an issue."

From news report, and President Trump's early endorsement of a ban, I thought it highly likely some legislation, or executive action, would result but then the topic fell off my radar until I took up this question and did some digging. A June 27 article at Reason (https://reason.com/archives/2018/06/27/atf-flips-on-bump-stock-ban-some-gun-rig) had insights that make me think there is only a small chance a Federal ban will be in place this year even though several states have moved forward. When Dianne Feinstein (D) and Thomas Massey (R) are on the same side of a gun issue opposing executive branch authority to implement a ban on bump stocks, arguing that is an issue for the legislature ... and radio silence from leaders in congress in an election year it seems quite unlikely to bubble up. Unless, of course, there is another incident ... I'm a newbie forecaster and I'm just not sure how to quantify 'seems highly unlikely' ... so I'll go with 5 % as my initial estimate then study and learn from what others reason and refine my probability."
