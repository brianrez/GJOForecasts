This indicates that while Trump has been harsh in his rhetoric and sanctions on Iran, this attack has not breached his threshold for military action against Iran. Saudi Arabia needs to find an actor to blame the attack on and needs to retaliate to save face internationally and domestically, however Iran's use of proxies gives them a way to save face and avoid direct confrontation with Iran [1]. Seeing as US government officials and Trump used equally harsh rhetoric on NK and military confrontation has been avoided and Trump just ousted Bolton, who was well known for his hawkish opinions on Iran, it is highly unlikely that the US will back the Saudi's militarily against Iran in the next 2 months, should the Saudi's conclude Iran was behind the attack and decided to retaliate militarily. Such a confrontation may take place, but I do not think that the conflict has escalated enough at this point to convince the US, the Saudi's, or the Iranians to make such a move.

I'm working on not-much info, but this seems similar to N Korea's nuclear threats- Kim Jong-un making threatening noises towards the U.S. to keep his generals in line.
