Worth bearing in mind that when sources talk of Johnson's ""determination"" to continue, the inference (based on his prorogation of Parliament & pathological deceit), is that he'll do almost anything to remain in power. Though crushing the pillars of democracy may be appealing to a minority within his party, the reaction of royalists outside St Paul's on Saturday will have sent chills down the spines of many others. A Tory leader viscerally distrusted by this demographic is a Tory leader with only two policy levers left to pull: he can bribe the electorate with yet more cash and 'red meat' for the far-right that completely alienate the centrists and the left, or he can double down on the lying & anti-democratic mechanisms designed to prevent his removal from office. Both approaches are likely to bring more pain upon their houses. As for 'losing the progress of the last few years' - that phantom has already fled from the realities of Johnson's leadership & Brexit. The longer he remains in power, the less time there will be to prepare a new leader for the next GE. The question is how many Tory MPs are willing to admit they can smell the gangrene and how quickly they're prepared to act. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-61693296"

If the conservatives do badly then they can blame it all on Johnson, and a one month gap between the election and the question close is ample time for that (which is what the question was opened to measure in the first place) especially if people have been making quiet manoeuvres in the background. Partygate has kind of forced the issue over who would be next, but in no way is anything going to happen before May 25. Oh and this isn’t the party that will lead this. They need a volunteer and who’s that going to be before May 25? It’s only 4 weeks away."

I didn't realise the ratio was relatively low: on 19 November, 23 MPs had publicly announced no confidence letters, nothing happened, and on 12 December after a further setback the 48 MP boundary was breached. So there was at most a 1:2 ratio of public to public+private letters. Right now there are 15 MPs publicly proclaiming no confidence, so at our most generous estimate there are 30 MPs total, way off the 54 target. There are of course different factors between these two cases, but I think not enough to give another factor of 2! With that in mind, I'm revising down my probabilities again, although I still think with new stories and no confidence letters each day, the chance of things suddenly changing is significant"

Whether Johnson limps on or not, he's fatally wounded, and according to the political editor of the Tory 'Telegraph' (on tonight's 'Newsnight'), it may be the AGM season in March/April, when MPs liaise with their local constituency members, that finally does for him as it did for Theresa May, rather than the later May elections. May eventually resigned in July, however in this instance it could be perceived that the process towards dismissal has already started. Few outside Johnson's immediate circle can be relishing a future - short or long term - in the hands of somebody seemingly intent on filthying or destroying every public institution including the law. Then there's this - published in the paper owned by Johnson's (former?) friend, Evgeny Lebedev. Rats/ship."

There's also the small issue of Johnson having final approval on what's published in the Gray report and whether politicians will be willing to read into redactions. Under normal circumstances Johnson would have already gone by now, so I'm still staying high, but the delay to Gray's report and the willingness of other politicians, the police and press to wait for this document overseen by, and potentially edited by, Johnson himself is making me nervous."

Currently several ministers are saving public judgement until the results of an inquiry by Sue Gray (who supposedly has a history of ending careers). Due to so many conservative MPs stating on record their desire for Johnson to resign, I would start of with a 57%.

The Tory Party can hardly welcome the prospect of a leadership challenge and as there is no obvious challenger a leadership challenge will fracture the party further. With the epidemic still raging in England and numerous other public policy challenges, this would be the worst possible time for a leadership challenge and the UK public gets no direct vote today or tomorrow. I think it's almost certain that Bojo will apologize and, if he is to go it will be voluntary after Bojo is confronted by Tory whips and told he is terminal. Only after a decisive defeat in upcoming local elections will Bojo resign and then only if there is the means for an orderly consensus successor. He is only 2 years into a 5 year term and any successor is likely to call a national election within 18 months. The Tory Party needs the entire 5 years to see any economic gains and to accomplish its primary objectives.

It is therefore highly unlikely there is a general election before 23 June. He could decide he doesn't fancy being Prime Minister any more and go back to writing his terrible Telegraph column. Again, seems highly unlikely - Prime Ministers don't tend to resign on a whim. Death comes to us all, alas, but Johnson is 55 and seems to be in relatively good health since recovering from Covid, so again this seems like a low probability outcome."

102121,2022-01-10T14:57:30Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"While there is clearly a wish by some in the Tory party to get rid of Boris as PM and I wouldn't be surprised to see Boris leave before the next GE, I don't think it will happen fast enough to meet the 23rd of June deadline. The opposition to Boris in the party does not seem unified so even if many no longer support Boris, there is no clear unified faction that is enough to take him down and no clear alternative. Boris himself was backed by the ERG against Theresa in quite an open manner. The potential replacements putting themselves forward (Liz and Rishi) are putting in work with the press but don't yet have the public backing of those trying to get rid of Boris. Presumably, they are both courting the different boris-out camps, which may take a while. Once there is a large enough unified section of the party ready to oust Boris, things can still take a while. Theresa faced her first vote of no confidence in December 2018 and resigned in June 2019. Boris is not even at the vote of no confidence stage yet. Because we are getting close(r) to the next planned GE, anyone replacing Boris (and the party) will need to be election ready and, most likely, snap-election ready. There is no indication that any of Bori's probable replacements are at that stage yet. Becoming the new PM now would be getting in at an unpleasant time where (i) Omicron will still provide negative press either way, as the party is split on how to deal with it, (ii) Unpopular financial measures are likely to be announced as we get closer to the budget, (iii) Brexit is back in the news and not in a good way, (iv) Labour is not doing anything but there isn't an easy line of attack on them either that could distract from the current outcome of 12 years of tory rule. At the end of the day, I think the tory party is very pragmatic about winning elections so the question should be viewed from that perspective rather than how many tories like Boris. None of the probable successors to Boris are proven election winners (which Boris is), so I think things will move slowly until someone can make the case internally that they can win a (snap) GE. That said, things can change..."

There are also local elections scheduled for May, where the Conservatives risk losing many seats. The Tories tend to be more ruthless about getting rid of leaders who are electorally unpopular.

There have been a few good comments already. How would I take over the leadership if I wanted to win the next election?? Probably not try and take over in the middle of a pandemic. Better to wait til the incumbent has burnt up all political capital then come in as a savior."
