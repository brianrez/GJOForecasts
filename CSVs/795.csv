If average daily death is 850 the total will be 148,100. If average death rate daily is 925, the total will be 150,050. I can understand the venal behavior associated with trying to fix and bet on the Nobel Prize foru Literature as we saw happen couple years ago. But the divisiveness this is causing by tearing the social fabric of a nominal democracy in Brazil is pure mendacity."

With 9 days remaining in August and 30 days in September, the projected deaths total by end of September is 151.422. Still a close call, but it seems that the 150k will likely be crossed, the 1.422 extra projected is equivalent of almost two days’ worth of casualties, therefore a significant ‘buffer’.

Last 7 days had an average of 987 deaths per day. The week before looks about the same. So, if we take the bookends approach: - To reach to 120k deaths it needs to be average of only 370 deaths per day until end of Sept. Too low, which means the 120k threshhold is bound to be crossed (assuming reporting continues and is not politically manipulated, I will choose to ignore any political manipulation of numbers). - With a low average of 600 deaths per day for the next 54 days, we get to ~133k deaths by end of Sept. - With a high average of 1000 deaths per day for the next 54 days, we get to ~155k deaths by end of Sept. - I expect today's average of 987 to drop in September, assuming the country gets over the peak. But, between 600 and 1,000 average deaths, it will be closer to the high, maybe 800-900. - The 150k threshold is crossed when average is ~925 deaths per day. - So, between the 120-150k and the 150-180k bracket, I am leaning somewhat more towards the lower. - If it is a normal distribution, with a mean of 800 deaths per day, and a P90 of 1000 deaths/day, then the 925 deaths per day sits at cumulative probability of 56%. I round up to 60% because I believe in it slowing down, more than I believe in maintaining a plateau of 800 or increasing, so I believe my normal distribution should be skewed to the lower end of it."

The high rate appears to be had been achieved by Government inaction and belief in the severity of the pandemic (especially for the President – who now has it). An essential part of a program to inhibit the infection rate upon the population is to instigate an efficient track and trace system that involves an appropriate volume of testing laboratories. Germany achieved this by having available such private labs that could achieve results in a minimum time. Brazil, like the UK has a centralised public system of testing that may suffer from miscommunicating between competing management organisations that result in disfunction. (A possible question to ask Good Judgment as to percentage successes between the two systems and assist in future pandemics). It should be noted that Brazil is still experiencing the first wave of infection, with future waves to arrive."

Stable number of daily deaths around 1000 for more than two months already is something, that didn´t happen in any other country so far. In countries doing enough tests it´s always one or several sigmoid functions (either overlapping at the same time (different areas) or after one another as ""waves""), but being linear for so long on such a high level is unique. It should be going up or down, not staying flat so long. Possible reasons: - limited testing capacity (no, they are doing 61500 per 1 million population) - political will (in that case the reported numbers would go down, when the real ones do, so that it looks a little more credible to external observers who can see trends even if they don´t know correct numbers)."

General expectation: ""usually it gets better after a while, but this looks like staying linear (for whatever reasons) much longer than everywhere else"". My assumption so far was similar: take the most likely scenarios and place your bets around their average accordingly. Boring, but effective most of the time. I´d like to add something to the equation, which leads me away from the crowd and especially from the more experienced people here. Simple idea: if the setting is relatively under control (most important: concerning numbers of tests), it makes sense to look at other numbers: ratio of active cases vs. recovered; critical cases; cases/1 M population; most important for this question: deaths/1 M population. Believe it or not: Brazil does not look so bad with those numbers. In other words: to go from 88K to 150K in 2 months (after having analyzed many other countries) they would need to be much worse. And they would need to have the worst number of deaths/1 M population of all. In other words: there is a limit of how bad it can get, and >150K is outside of what I believe about it.Comments welcome."

On one hand the population is younger than in developed countries (an advantage) and on the other a very high proportion of poor and extremely poor people make up the general population, affecting health and access to healthcare. There's the risk of Bolsorano attempting (again) to suppress coronavirus data, making it difficult for the WHO to publish accurate results. Another risk is the WHO ceasing to publish Brazil data in the event of Brazil withdrawing from the WHO (which Bolsorano has threatened previously). He seems to have threatened this on the back of the US announcement to withdraw themselves, but considering Trump's dwindling poll numbers and the court and public backlash at home that forced Bolsorano to restart Covid data publication, he may take a step back to wait and see how Trump's handling of the virus plays out in the US election in early November. This is why I take the view that the likely numbers will be between 90k-120k, with a higher death count less likely (due to potential treatments being developed between now and then, possible data suppression closer to the end of September and/or WHO withdrawal). In addition, there are more situations leading to publication of <90k deaths than there are leading to publication of more than 150k deaths given all of the above. should no interference take place and no major medical developments made, will fall into the 90k-120k bracket."
