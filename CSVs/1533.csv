An unnamed North Korean official told South Korean reporters on Friday that Pyongyang had sent an invitation to Xi to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the country’s foundation on September 9. The anniversary is one of the hermit kingdom’s most important annual holidays, along with the birthdays of late leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. If Xi does go, it will be the first trip to North Korea by a Chinese president since Hu Jintao’s visit in October 2005 and since Pyongyang started conducting nuclear and missile tests in 2006. ...Kim has visited China to meet Xi three times since March – the first two times in the lead-up to the summit and the third in June to brief China on the outcome of the talks. Liu Ming, from the Centre for Korea Studies at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, said North Korea might be trying to use Xi’s presence at the celebrations to suggest the bilateral relationship was back on track. “North Korea would also look weaker if Xi did not visit given that Kim has visited China three times,” Liu said, adding that Xi gave his word that he would go when Kim visited in March. “Chinese leaders often made reciprocal visits in Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il’s time, but not in Kim Jong-un’s. The chance of Xi accepting the invitation is quite high.” ...Cui Zhiying, director of the Korean Peninsula Research Centre at Tongji University in Shanghai, agreed that North Korea might see Xi’s visit as its first step to becoming a normal state. ...“If Xi actually visits North Korea, bilateral relations will reach a new stage ... of cooperation. China has always opposed chaos on the Korean peninsula and thus wanted the Kim regime to be stable. This will never change.”"

But I think going to North Korea right away is likely to make North Korea / Kim look more important right now than less. Especially if Trump ends up in Pyongyang), I don't see China following suit. Nor do I see them rushing off to Pyongyang to beat Trump to the punch; it's not such a significant move for them and is far more likley to make them look weak rather than strong. Plus they have little to lose from Kim grandstanding since they still hold most of the cards...and much more to gain by expanding diplomatic power in Asia and elsewhere while the Trump and Kim flirt. And there are a many parties in Asia who would rely more on a rational, steady, slow-to-act, economically-driven power close to home that are being left out by Trump's current US policy and already wondering what the role in in a changing power dynamic in Asia. China has maintained support for North Korea in its media: suggesting sanctions be lifted (opposing Trump's wait for denuclearization), through opening air travel to Pyongyang and escorting Kim to Singapore, etc. They've also been stepping up other diplomatic activities in the region. I know that Chinese officials said back in May that Xi would probably visit North Korea ""sometime after the summit"" as a reciprocal diplomatic action, but postponing until they're good and ready seems more likely. Kim on the other hand is likely to make the most of his own international diplomatic activities, even more so if China delays, I would think. Furthermore, with so much left off the table and pending concrete decisions and actions, there's a much better chance that China can push for talks among many players and further discussions. It still seems to me that China is unlikely to send anyone so high level to visit until after things are more settled."

IF that's the case, then surely the Chinese of all people would have gotten that feeling years ago. So given those hard feelings of the North Koreans, which they have discouraged publicly as well, then what's the point of China being friendly with NK if it can't restrain its nuclear capabilities? Especially given that continued friendliness with NK might mean economic retaliation from the US, and conversely, that friendliness with NK wouldn't bring China any benefits, why would they be friendly."
