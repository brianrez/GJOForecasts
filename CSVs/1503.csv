Life expectancy at birth for males, according to the World Bank for Afghanistan, is ~62 (2015 data). According to Wikipedia, Ashraf Ghani, is 68 years old and thus has surpassed national life expectancy data. According to online sources, Ghani does not seem to have any public health records showing any diseases or issues (i.e., heart issues). Ashraf Ghani's personal indicators show that as a healthy individual, he will not cease to be president of Afghanistan. However, according to the World's Bank's poverty headcount ratio at national poverty lines (% of population), 35.8% live at the poverty line as of 2015. This is an important indicator on the national level to assess public opinion and health of citizens. In 2017 Trump announced new plans for the ""war"" in Afghanistan - which he will not stay consistent on as he does not stay focus on one thing, rather tends to focus on domestic politics. In 2014, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry set up an agreement that placed Ghani in power; thus the US really cannot remove him from the given power. Ghani's removal will have to come from a national movement, citizens protesting Taliban and ISIS controlled areas to the government. Since Ghani's support does not come from Afghan minorities - July 1 2018 is too soon for a removal of the president by the minorities of the country. According to The Diplomat ""The most recent survey conducted on the people of Afghanistan showed that the public‚Äôs faith in state institutions stood at a 10-year low, with only 37 percent of those surveyed holding confidence in the Afghan parliament and 35 percent confident in government ministers. The impact of identity politics is most visible in the survey when seen through ethnic lines."" I will take longer than July 2018 in order to leadership exit that will cause conflict/war in Afghanistan since it is a weak state but does have a strong society embedded in religion and nationalism. Afghan's will have to choose if removing their leader is worth war in their state."

Abdullah has support with many conservatives in the country and can be seen as someone to get rid of corruption and unite the country. Add to this the widespread perception (in some cases warranted) of both incompetency and corruption in the Afghan election process as a whole and there is an undercurrent of doubt surrounding Ghani.

The low probability of this event occurring is based upon several factors. The event has only about 4 months and 1 week to occur. Ashraf Ghani has been president of Afghanistan since 2014 and does not seem to be interested in stepping down voluntarily or due to a democratic election. Afghanistan‚Äôs Independent Election Commission announced that the country will hold its parliamentary and district council elections on 7 July 2018, which is 6 days after the 1 July 2018 deadline in the question. Also, this proposed election is scheduled to take place 3 years past the expiration of the sitting parliament‚Äôs 5-year mandate. A reshaping of the parliament and district councils could factor into Ghani‚Äôs decision to step down, but in the unlikely event that it even takes place, it will occur after the deadline in the question. Historically, elections in Afghanistan face major hurdles and difficulties due to declining security and safety in many parts of the country. The political instability and the public‚Äôs insecurity will likely derail the parliamentary election, which undoubtedly will result in Ghani‚Äôs power grip on the Afghani presidency. Ghani is a slow reformer and takes many actions that may be deemed as autocratic in nature, which impede the opposition to form and contest the government‚Äôs power."
