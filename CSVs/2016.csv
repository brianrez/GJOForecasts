Iran’s rankings during 2012-14 were 66th, 82nd and 83rd respectively. However, the competitiveness of each country is based on 12 pillars. Iran has a lot going for it as it has a well educated workforce, diversified its sectors after the oil crash and has invested in science projects. However, the government's hesitation to open to foreign investors has also put a limit on growth potential and trading partners.

The US embargo continues, along with sanctions that forbid anyone doing business in Iran from using the US financial system. OFAC has been either unwilling or unable to explain to the Iranians what they need to do to get this sorted, according to the piece. So (a) US firms can't do business in Iran, although businesses from other countries can do and have begun; and (b) financing arrangements for firms entering that market can be pretty convoluted, but at least they now exist. Whatever Iran does to try to get right with the US will be much more likely to enhance than to damage their competitiveness picture."

The report is released in Sept and I contacted WEF to ask if the report was a forecast or an assessment of real time data. Here's their reply: ""The Global Competitiveness Report assesses the current state of competitiveness of a country. It is based on hard data and on data from our Executive Opinion Survey. Should you want to know more about the Executive Opinion Survey, please see p. 75 of the report (http://www3.weforum.org/docs/gcr/2015-2016/Global_Competitiveness_Report_2015-2016.pdf )."" Interestingly, the survey is conducted in 41 languages but Farsi is not one of them. As far as the nuclear deal implications, it seems to me that a report released in Sept based on surveys will take time to complete and teh surveys are probably going to end by late summer at latest. So I'm inclined to think much of the nuclear deal's outcomes will not be felt in GCI rankings until next year's report. And perhaps more importantly, here's a forecast of GCI for Iran in 2016 by quarter. It forecasts above 76 in each quarter: http://www.tradingeconomics.com/iran/competitiveness-rank/forecast http://www.tradingeconomics.com/iran/forecast"

With better missiles and weaker (some would say unchanged at zero) nukes, Iran will not improve on these criteria - if they were to be measured. Last year's ranking include: 70. Montenegro 71.

I might be unfamiliar with Botswana, but it still sounds like a joke. Also, just a year before, Brazil was ranked 57th, and Botswana a miserly 74th. (Go Botswana, you can do better next time.)

Even if reformers within Iran make huge gains, at least since the 2012-2013 index no country has risen over 14 places in the ranking in a single year, which Iran would have to do in order to rank in the top 60. As to whether it crosses below the 75th rank threshold, the average rank change for countries between 64 and 83 (a 20-rank range centered on 74; my way of approximating change in this section of the rankings) was 1.2 this year, 2 last year, and zero the year before that, so my prior is to assume a small positive change. Given that 5 of the 20 nations in the 64-83 range this year saw their ranking fall, as did 6 of 20 the year before, the average chance of dropping in rankings for a nation in this range is about 27.5%."
