"In Manhattan Community Access Corp. v. Halleck, will the Supreme Court rule that the Manhattan Neighborhood Network is a public forum for First Amendment purposes?",2019-01-11T18:00:51Z,2019-06-17T17:00:35Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Society'],142,654,80,237,"A suit over First Amendment rights violations was dismissed by the district court, concluding that First Amendment protections do not apply to Manhattan Neighborhood Network because it is not a public forum and its employees are not state actors (Reuters, Oyez, SCOTUSBlog). The appeals court reversed in part, ruling that public access TV channels in Manhattan are public forums and the case should proceed (SCOTUSBlog). The Supreme Court is expected to hand down its decision in its current term, but if it does not, the question will resolve as no. Confused?
