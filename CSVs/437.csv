The WW price trend for this commodity is much in line with US one due to globalization. And the expectations are that the current paper shortage will last at least up to the mid of 2022.

In addition, there could be other factors that would push for a price increase even if the aforementioned ones will cease to affect the price trend. Sustainability is one of them. 28-Jan-2022.

EU will continue to reinforce the sustainable tree cut laws even the sources are outside EU. The suppliers have to demonstrate the raw materials are managed in a sustainable way. And this is raising up prices. Higher prices will also have their effect on consumption. Prices will scale up until finding a new balance.
