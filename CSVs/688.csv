So essentially the question boils down to when will the Premier League allow 1/3 capacity at games. Current guidance is for 1000-2000 and is likely to remain the status quo until at least the spring. The 2021/22 season would likely begin before October 2020 though. Is it possible that 25,000 could be allowed back into grounds for this point. In Japan's J-League there have already been sporting events with ~50% capacity despite Covid still being an outstanding issue. I think it is very possible although not likely given transport issues getting to grounds. I assign a 25% probability to this scenario. The next two windows are narrower, and I see it as less likely that restrictions would be eased during winter months should Covid remain an issue. I see only a relatively small chance that no game will see a 25,000 attendance before May 2021 as ultimately money talks and there will be severe pressure to at least trial such a scenario.

That said I think the FA / premier league are already prepared and ready to move fast when things improve and it looks like a level of Immunisation will be in place and running over the winter. I am now forming a view that the likelihood of the attendance target NOT being hit before the end of the season (24th May) is lowering by the day.

While ticket sales mean money the lawsuits and safety issues associated with getting people into the stands prematurely simply isn't worth the risk. It will likely take months for them to phase in enough fans to a single stadium to meet this criteria and that will only begin once cases have gone down from where they are perched right now. Ultimately, I think fans will be allowed back into the stadiums en masse come next season. Before then, it'll be mostly empty seats and authorized personnel only."

In addition, Manchester United have recently proposed a COVID-19 capacity of ~23,500. This is by some way the largest club ground in the PL, and whilst Old Trafford is aging and may be less easily converted to appropriate distancing measures, this still represents less than a third of the standard capacity. As such it seems unlikely even the newer, though smaller stadiums are going to manage to get closer to half full (e.g. the other three 60,000 seater stadiums would be 40% capacity). In addition, I imagine significantly smaller volumes of spectators will be allowed in initially, and several weeks of evaluation to determine if attending games results in spikes of cases. At present, COVID cases are going in the wrong direction - opening up football stadiums is far from governments minds. I will re-evaluate in the new year, or when a vaccine is found."

Even games with the Premier Leagues' most popular teams, for example, Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham, 25,000 would still be nearly at 50% capacity. The long hold out, and a possible source of optimism, is Old Trafford. With a capacity of nearly 75,000 attendance of 25,000 would be only 33%, which still seems high. Additionally, with the UK seeing increases in numbers and shelving plans for limited fan attendance in the coming weeks, it seems unlikely to see attendance levels anywhere close. The possibility of a vaccine being produced for large scale production in Q1 2021 leaves open a slight chance of larger gatherings in the mid-March to mid-May timeframe. However, given that would represent only the last few match week's of the season, the league may look for the 2021-2022 season for higher attendance levels. Thus, the 98% likelihood of a post 24MAY2021 for the 25,000 attendance levels."

I read a BBC article yesterday which points out that the actual number of COVID cases are much lower than during the March outbreak (Increased testing is resulting in a higher number of confirmed cases however a lack of testing in March/April resulted in most reported case numbers coming from hospital admissions thus not giving an accurate number of actual cases or useful comparison). The current lower number of hospital admissions and deaths supports the theory that the second wave is not yet a concrete occurrence but figures over the next 3-4 weeks will help clarify. This has made me feel a little more optimistic about the potential for 25k attendance to happen 16th March and 23 May so have tweaked my scores accordingly."

It is to be seen whether these measures alone are sufficient and it is possible that cases will continue to rise leading to further lockdown and not less. Also this situation is unlikely to abate over the winter months and a vaccine will most likely not be available on sufficient scale to conduct a nationwide vaccine programme till next year. As a result the probability of at least 25k fans attending a premier league this year are highly remote. A vaccine development this year, the commencement of spring, or a reduction in case numbers could result in the potential for a 25k+ match to be held towards the end of Q1. Although nearing the end of the season clubs generate significant revenue from stadium attendance and there will be immense pressure to accommodate stadium capacities if a change in situation warrants."
