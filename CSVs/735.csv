Democrat has higher odds than the crowd says because: 1) Congressional races are tough to poll, but still, Valenzuela did well in last month's polls: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/house/texas/ 2) Trump is only up by 1.0 in Texas's polling average: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/texas/ 3) Suburban districts like this one have been trending blue since 2016. Republican barely won in 2018, despite being a long-time incumbent. 4) Demographic changes.

It is seen as most pundits as either a toss-up or a leaning red district, which I think is a reasonable projection. Its retiring representative is a Republican who has served in the House since 2004, and while he only won by 3 points in the 2018 election, a 16 year tenure should not be taken for granted. Furthermore, Trump is up by around 6 points in the district, suggesting that a Dem swing due to inadequate voter turnout or Republican disenfranchisement is unlikely. The race will likely be close, but given that there are few demonstrable advantages for the Democrats, I'd say its the Republicans to lose."

Valenzuela can definitely win this open seat in a district that Trump only won 51/46 in 2016 and that Marchant barely held in 2018 (Beto won this district) - the major cities in Texas, and many of their suburbs, are turning more D. Marchant announced his retirement for a reason. That said, Van Duyne is well-known in the area as the former mayor of Irving and Valenzuela is an outsider with a limited resume. I think if Biden/Harris win, then this district will flip too."
