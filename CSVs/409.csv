""We expect it to have at least a couple more rounds and maybe annually, we're just going to continue to fight this virus back."" In making the case to soon start rolling out a third dose, Hoge cited research suggesting waning immunity against the virus.

The US has access to a large enough supply of vaccines for booster shots to be practical to provide, and the medical evidence seems to be that booster shots would be safe and effective, even when mixing different vaccines. Thus as countries such as the UK move forward with booster shots starting in September (per published UK government plans), it seems reasonable to expect the FDA and/or the CDC to announce a similar program. I also believe this may be motivated by public demand. The uncertainty for me is more about how fast the CDC and/or the FDA will move. If this does not happen before November, at which point the Delta variant may have passed its peak, then it is more likely to happen later in the event of a new variant that is even more infectious for fully vaccinated people."
