If Turkey don't get what they want, they could purchase a fleet of Russian fighter planes instead a number of US-made F-16s - this deal is currently on the table. Turkey has mentioned this as an option. Ergo, Turkey has an uneasy relationship with Russia, but they will take them as an ally if needed. 6/ Russia would welcome a conflict with an EU member as a distraction from the war on Ukraine. 7/ There are regular close quarters encounters at sea, and any such event could lead to an alleged or real weapons use."

A minor incident could happen within this definition due to disputes over territorial waters and right of drilling ships to operate. Probability is low because other topics are distracting Turkey more, and there are international legal avenues to pursue first."

368,2022-10-28T18:36:53Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"Since the 2019-2020 talks between Greece and Turkey, there has been a deescalation of tensions and conflict between the two nation states. With discovery of natural gas resources in the eastern Mediterranean, the internationalization of the Libyan civil war, and diffused dynamics of problems of migration between them, the likelihood of increased tensions among the nation states simmer underneath the dynamics of their geopolitical relationship. Assessments indicate that tensions between the two nation states are in neither's interest and create dynamics of constraint. However, Turkey continues to pursue its goal of seeking to be the energy hub to Europe. The Russian-Ukrainian conflict, international sanctions (EU and USA primarily) on the Russian state because of its invasion of Ukraine encourages Ankara's regional aspirations. Alternatively, Greece continues to forge regional partners with other nation states in order to constrain Turkey's ambitions. The eastern Mediterranean Seas are strategic for trade between Europe and Asia adding to the heightened tensions in the region and between the two nation states. While the likelihood of event(s) occurring that would meet conditions for this IFP exist, the outcome suggested is relatively unlikely but simultaneously possible. Given the strategic interests of both nation states and their ability to constrain each other geopolitically, my initial assessment would be that this outcome is unlikely."
