"On 29 June 2018, how many public DC Fast Charge electric vehicle charging stations will be available in the United States?",2017-09-08T17:00:54Z,2018-06-29T06:59:54Z,"Less than 2,400","['Less than 2,400', 'Between 2,400 and 2,700, inclusive', 'Between 2,701 and 3,100, inclusive', 'More than 3,100']",['Technology'],850,654,332,237,"The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is subject to a ""chicken and egg"" problem such that potential consumers are waiting for an extensive charging network and businesses are awaiting more electric cars on the roads to justify building more charging stations. This problem is especially relevant for DC Fast Charging stations that can fully charge the EV in less than 30 minutes. This question will be resolved using data from the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center. Data on public DC Fast Charging stations can be found by clicking on ""more search options"" and selecting only ""DC Fast"" on the ""Charger types"" drop-down menu. The relevant number is ""electric stations."" Confused? Check our FAQ or ask us for help. As of 29 June there are 2,318 public DC Fast Charge electric vehicle charging stations available. This question closed as ""Less than 2,400"" with an end date of 29 June.

It was only half of that last year, but there are quite a few fluctuations, so we will go with a possibly slightly to high estimate of 2000 per year. Around 10% of the stations are DC stations, which would yield 200 of those built per year. However, it is likely that a significantly bigger perecentage of the new stations uses the new and better technology, and it could even be, that old stations are being replaced by newer DC ones. So i will go with an estimate of 40% of newly built stations being DC stations and arrive at 800 stations per year. The possible overestimation of the base rate hopefully cancels out with my ignorance of ongoing projects of VW, Tesla and the like to strengthen the infrastructure. So i arrive at a point estimate of 800/12*(4+2/3)=311 new stations until the deadline, which will most likely land in the lower 2400 - 2700 bracket.

A gas station, hotel, corporate office park looking toward the future might add electric chargers as a result of the swing automakers are making toward electric. For offices it's a perk for businesses/their employees, and might also provide them some tax breaks (depending upon future policy and states). That said, I don't think the growth will necessarily accelerate yet, as the hope would be that the cost comes down first, before the tipping point.
