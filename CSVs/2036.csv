The Defense Ministry said Tuesday that a battery of the S-300 air defense missile systems has been deployed to Syria to protect a Russian navy facility in the Syrian port of Tartus and Russian navy ships in the area. The deployment will add punch to the Russian military force in Syria, which has long-range S-400 missile defense systems and an array of other surface-to-air missiles at the Hemeimeem air base in Syria's coastal province of Latakia (para 1-4)."

Its possible that Russia could provoke an incident somewhere else, possibly in the period after US elections and the new US President taking office, if it thought that the US might be slow to react, with the aim to have occupied some territory before NATO reacted. It is possible that Russia might provoke an incident in order to get a reaction from the US that might affect the US elections. (e.g. create an incident in Transnistria that threatened Moldova and Romania, Romania being in NATO, hoping to stir up rhetoric that would improve Trump's chances of getting elected, which Putin sees as being to his advantage.

Turkey considers U.S.-backed People's Protection Units (YPG) to be terrorists connected to Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) insurgents who operate inside Turkey. The spokesman's statement comes the day after news broke that the White House is considering directly arming YPG fighters for the first time, as reported by the New York Times. The move is representative of the tightrope the United States has to walk in Syria: The YPG has been one of the most effective forces fighting against the Islamic State, but sending weapons to Kurdish fighters would surely aggravate Turkey."

What would be the US NATO response to an Article 4 declaration by a NATO member this summer right before US general elections? I'm not saying its gonna happen...just thinking out loud.

Low cost/consequences for the US invoking article 4 and I'm guessing Putin would understand and not overreact. Brussels could probably use the business too. —but as you can tell, my forecast isn't too high in anticipation of this."

Turkey pounded PYD/YPG targets near Syria's Azaz on Thursday with T-155 Fırtına howitzers, in retaliation for the terrorist organization's cross-border fire into southern border town Kilis. Previously, the military shelled YPG targets near the town of Azaz in northern Syria on Feb. 13, under the rules of engagement and in response to two separate attacks carried out by YPG and Assad forces on a Turkish military base and a police station. http://www.dailysabah.com/politics/2016/02/19/turkey-hits-ypgpyd-targets-with-artillery-rockets"

( http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/131675 ) While I know they claim not to be there yet, I'm thinking that the Aleppo operation might also be freaking out the French. Whether they can't shake their colonial legacy of the past in this area, or they have visions of a new rule, er role, France has the hots for Syria. From Sarkozy fomenting the Arabs in Ridyah, to Fabius's rebuke of Obama for not pressing direct action, it doesn't seem likely that those UAE and Saudi Arabian forces targeted at Aleppo will be going without French accompaniment of some sort. So, what I'm saying is that it might very well be France that triggers this question, but under this scenario we'd probably need to see the Arabs first deploy and then the French make some announcement as to accompaniment. Then, there's some proxy clash gone bad and French troops end up facing off with Russian troops. As the Arabs deploy and the French announce, I'll raise my forecast correspondingly."

1708,2015-12-14T09:35:32Z,3,[75.0],[0.0],"""Russia says fired warning shots at Turkish ship in Aegean to avoid collision"" http://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/International-Relations/Russia-says-fired-warning-shots-at-Turkish-ship-in-Aegean-to-avoid-collision. It may not lead to Art 4 being invoked now, but the relationship appears likely to be headed that way in near future. I think there's a high risk Russia may take action against a Turkish jet, naval vessel or personnel on ground assisting Syrian Turkmen. I think Putin correctly judges that he could get away with one instance of such action and both Obama and European NATO members would simply call for calm and no escalation. Most NATO members seem to really think it was a mistake for Turkey to have shot down the Russian jet and I think they would not react with force if only a Turkish jet, vessel or small group of soldiers were killed. Obama is coming to the end of his presidency that was supposed to be defined by stopping wars and engaging with adversaries with diplomacy. Putin's power base is largely nationalistic with elements of ""reexpansionism"" to former soviet borders and military bases (i.e. E Europe, C Asia and Arctic). After seeing their airman bloodied on the ground surrounded by Turkmen, the Russian public wants and Putin needs for his power base a single act of revenge. All this is really more of an Art 5 issue, but I think the US would pressure Turkey to simply call for Art 4 and use that forum to ""discuss"" the issue and call for no escalation. Invoking Art 5 would almost necessitate NATO action because of its clear language authorizing force if member attacked."

He will push NATO member states in E Europe, particularly in the Baltics and Balkans just shy of invoking Article 5, and Article 4 provides the perfect mark for Putin to measure that limit. Montenegro's expected inclusion in NATO poses a great risk of Russia retaliating with cyber propaganda and ""volunteer"" ethnic Russian militias occupying state offices in portions of the country in response to a decision to join NATO. Russian actions in Georgia and Ukraine were a direct response to signals from those countries of a potentially imminent inclusion in NATO. Putin gave a speech in 2008 warning of the consequences of such NATO expansion. Montenegro will be no different in my opinion. http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/18/exclusive-the-pentagon-is-preparing-new-war-plans-for-a-baltic-battle-against-russia/ http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/naval/2015/09/06/sweden-finland-sharpen-amphibious-readiness-baltic/71596700/ http://www.unian.info/world/111033-text-of-putins-speech-at-nato-summit-bucharest-april-2-2008.html"

Military personnel (active and reserve) in both Turkey (1m) and Poland (635k) is significant whilst that in Bulgaria (300k) and Romania (150k). The invocation of Article 4 would unlikely be motivated by a genuine military threat against any of these nations by Russia. Instead, it is more likely that Article 4, which triggers a gathering of all NATO member states, would be used to as an opportunity to re-affirm international opinion against Russia's actions in Ukraine and, in doing so, solidify support for the maintenance of the sanctions against Russia. A politically-inspired, rather than militarily motivated invocation, is therefore plausible. NATO website states: ""In Article 4 of NATO’s founding treaty, members are encouraged to bring subjects to the table for discussion within the North Atlantic Council, the principal forum for political consultation."" (source http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_49187.htm). Though article 4 has only been invoked 5 times since the creation of NATO, it has been used twice recently by both Poland (in 2014 concerning Russia) and Turkey (in 2015 regarding Syria). As an outside bet, Ukraine itself could potentially become a NATO member (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_Partnership_Action_Plan) and therefore invoke article 4 however the timetable for membership almost certainly extends beyond 1 Jan 2017. The recent visit to Kyiv by the NATO Secretary General, during which agreements were signed to formalise the NATO’s diplomatic representation in Ukraine, to support communications, and to strengthen technical cooperation on defence highlights the desire to bring Ukraine on board."

It took about a month from the start of the crisis to the annexation of Crimea. At present, I don't see anything pressing a NATO member to invoke Article 4 on Russia. If anything Turkey should have done it more recently when in October Russian jets violated their airspace (http://www.wsj.com/articles/turkey-says-russian-fighter-jet-violated-its-airspace-with-syria-1444040488). Turkey has decided to invoke Article 4 on ISIS and the Kurds which are the more pressing problems that hit closer to home. Britain stationing troops to deter Russia might cause Russia to act aggressively which would create a possibility of invoking Article 4. A traditional Soviet block country that feels it's security is threatened will invoke Article 4 against Russia. So far, there seems to be no country in the former Soviet Republic that appears to be unstable. However, things can change very quickly in Central Europe. Russian involvement in Georgia was in 2008, Ukraine 2014, Syria 2015. Economic sanctions coupled with insecurity of its post Cold War geopolitical position, Russia could very well be an aggressor in 2016."

In my opinion, Erdogan has been waiting for a stronger political hand from the snap election and now he has it with his majority win over the weekend. Most of what I have read has been concern that with this stronger hand he would go after the Kurdish rebels but I have a hunch he could also use it to go after the Russians. I have to admit I have a perverse wish for the Turks to roll into northern Syria and kick Putin's ass into the Med. But lets get real here, the best path forward is to cooperate with the Russians and somehow stabilize the current situation. Obama would probably have to give up his demand that Assad step down. Obama has just deployed fifty special forces to the Free Syrians ( maybe with Stinger missiles?) so it does not look like he is backing down. To invoke Article 4 I think Erdogan would want some kind of pretext like a screw up by the Russians and that is not hard to envision. Ironically all the Patriot battery that were sent by NATO a few years ago to backup the Turkish air border have recently been withdrawn a few days ago ( that was the wrong signal to send to the Russians!). Its a total mess. Still some minor border incident would allow Turkey to invoke Article 4 and the way the Russians are going that could occur any day now. An Article 4 would get the Patriot missiles back into southern Turkey were they should be and trigger the question. There is long time period on this question so I am going with a very high estimate."
