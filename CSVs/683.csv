Only Istanbul has elected a non AKP Mayor. Erdogan has the same ideology of the Muslim brotherhood. Indeed he is another brother. Brother or not he Has acquiesced to his son in law buying oil from ISIS and Tehran. He is so powerful he could entrust his Son in law and putative successor with as much as 1 trillion dollars of infrastructure. So now his son in law Head of the Turkish Central Bank Has been fired,. Turkey foreign debt is so huge and the lira so devaluated interest rates will have to be at 20 percent or higher for the foreseeable future. No economist,Erdogan from his childhood in the blue collar pious districts of Istanbul,has wanted to be a modern day Sultan. Just like the Ottomans he intervenes in Libya,Syria, and Turkish oil exploration all over eastern med has almost started a war. Erdogan would have to go stone cold dead before he would leave power. He nay not last as long as Putin but after A decade,no political party,no CHP,Kurd coalition will stop him in elections. The chance of Erdogan dying before end date are 1 to 2 percent. But that would be too convenient for US NATO. Both he and Putin are purely transactional. Putin sells Erdogan S400 anti aircraft systems. Putin and Erdogan fight it out in Libya,Syria and Nagorno-Karabakh between proxies. So if I could I would direct covert support to the Mayor of Istanbul and encourage the development of a political party centered on the cosmopolitan middle class in Istanbul. Turkey has become the 19nth largest economy in world. In the long run Erdogan will fall because the interests of the pious AKP is inconsistent with the interests of the secular middle class and wealthy who benefit from that economy. US should help hasten the process now. US ought to plan for a future where a strong pro Western Democracy will be a true ally in NATO and a real candidate for the EU."

(The Turkish government also hates the Armenians, due to their historic genocide claims against Turkey. See, I told you this was going to get complicated.) The trouble is Armenia is a member of the Russian-led Collective Security Treat Organisation (CSTO) – a sort of Nato for Eastern Europe – while Turkey is an actual member of Nato. There is a scenario where Azerbaijan’s attack on Armenia triggers the CSTO and Russian forces come to its aid and find themselves fighting Turkish forces which triggers Nato’s article V clause. It’s not that likely, but the possibility only highlights how fraught this military clash is."

Terms for the President and all 600 Parliament members are for five years and while early elections have occurred before, they were months early, not years. According to some political scientists in Turkey, an early election wouldn't happen until August or September '21, but the chances of an early election that soon amidst the pandemic and economic, military, religious and political issues seems very slim. An early election would allow Erdogan to employ a constitutional loop hole that allows him to go beyond the two-term limit with the dissolving of Parliament and would catch the two new opposition parties unprepared and un-consolidated. While the motivation to do this is high, Erdogan needs to ensure that his dwindling support in the nation is enough for an early win."

Erdogan has the confidence to straddle a variety of fences. Turkey is a member of NATO and yet the country is purchasing Russian missile systems; he appears to be on good terms with Putin as an ally in both Libya and Syria; he has determined Turkey to be the defender of the Muslim faith and has defended Palestinian rights against the recent Arab agreements to recognise Israel. He is friendly with Trump. Erdogan cannot be compared to previous leaders of modern Turkey and their length of tenure as he used a popular referendum to shift a parliamentary system to an an executive presidency, abolishing the position of Prime minister, diminishing the power of parliament and gaining the ability to rule by decree and appoint ministers and judges and control the budgets of the military and police. Rather than hedging his bets, he appears to confident in expanding the influence of his country and he has achieved internally and is probably in position for the long term. https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/reports/2020/08/24/489727/turkeys-president-erdogan-losing-ground-home/ http://www.jamesinturkey.com/can-recep-tayyip-erdogan-run-for-a-third-term-as-president/ https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/09/08/turkeys-strongman-recep-tayyip-erdogan-takes-to-the-world-stage"

Turkey always seems to be one months away from a currency crisis and yet the crisis never seems to happen. There always seems to be storm clouds on Horizon and it never rains. So Erdogan is safe until impending economic collapse. He is to clever to commit and international relations sin that would remove him from office. He uses the international stage to distract from the potential economic calamity that worries him. It also serves to remind Europe and the USA that it is better to have turkey weekend and running around on its own."
