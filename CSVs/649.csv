Assuming a better case scenario of only 200,000 per day then the case incidence will reach 35,000,000 in 39 days (13 Feb). For the case load to not reach 35 Million before 1 Mar the total number of cases would need to be less than 143,000 per day on average. No single day rate has been below this since early October, let alone the average. It seems unlikely that the case load could drop so quickly regardless of a vaccine."

I estimate an average on 180k new cases daily through winter, so around 120 days from now, we should see 35 million cases confirmed. A vaccine may make a dent in those numbers, but high risk people will be prioritised, so I expect it to make little difference within this timeframe. So, my prediction is around 11 March 2021."
