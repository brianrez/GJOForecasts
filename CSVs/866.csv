No evidence I can see that the weekends have fewer cases (although weirdly some indication Saturdays are high and Sundays are low). However, you are also seeing upwards revisions in previous numbers, and the last two days numbers seem very high versus earlier in the week in what could be the start of a trend rather than noise. Going for 60/40 which is a 20-25% chance we are in a higher cases regime (maybe due to the run down of social distancing, or spreading in non-distanced areas) and 75-80% numbers are broadly similar to the last month, which would have suggest 50/50"
