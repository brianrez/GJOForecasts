""One EU official cautions that there are still significant ongoing transatlantic differences over technology. The question was whether the EU and US could “get over differences on data protection and big data content, and focus on the conditions that will allow us to prevail technologically in the geopolitical great power competition”, the official says. Tensions over semiconductors highlight how difficult this will be. The Dutch company ASML dominates the market for the advanced machines needed by Chinese companies to make high-end chips needed for devices such as smartphones. But ASML has been unable since 2019 to obtain a licence from the Dutch government to export its extreme ultraviolet lithography equipment to China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, the country’s biggest chipmaker, according to people familiar with the matter. Biden on Thursday banned Americans from investing in 59 Chinese companies that included SMIC. The Netherlands has not disclosed the reason for the licence freeze, but people familiar with the matter say the Trump administration successfully lobbied the Dutch government because of concerns about the potential for EUV technology to help the Chinese military develop advanced weapons. ASML says it fully understands that the Dutch foreign ministry needs time to reach a decision “given the current geopolitical landscape and rapidly changing international legislation”. Sigrid Kaag, the Dutch trade minister, said last month that the ASML case was under “continuous” review. “It’s obviously a fine line but we want to remain an open trading nation, so we are in continuous dialogue with our allies on this as this is a very particular and . . . sensitive case,” she said. Kaag said the EU needs to “team up” with the US to address many points of agreement on China, but that would require the bloc “to get its act together” and co-ordinate better between its various institutions to avoid contradictory outcomes in its China policy."" https://www.ft.com/content/e4c7df1a-5048-4cf1-8a2d-c9a2d721ba92"

Of course SMIC want to move up the value chain, but the jump seems large, albeit skipping a generation might be no bad thing if there is no associated loss in learning. Given the current geopolitical environment, sharing cutting edge technology with China would seem like a political minefield. Even if the Netherlands provided the licenses, there are still issues around US sanctions.

However, the Biden Administration has been less than detailed in what their strategy towards China really is. Additionally, the mess that is the Dutch government after their recent election will probably slow any issuance process in the short term. Holding my forecast stable for now."
