In contrast, the Republican party is facing a messaging problem. They are scrambling to find a tag line that would give them the opportunity to pick up House seats and the rhetoric and unpopular policies of the conservative wing of the Republican party is crushing the more centrist approach to governing-- fracturing the party. With that being said, Republicans, a divided party, are unlikely to gain any traction in the mid-terms due to the fact that they have nothing to show for the last two years (save overturning Roe), their poor messaging, and inability to unite their base and bring in voters from the more centrist, moderate folds of the party."

Democrats are looking to possibly pick up three seats, despite the fact that Republicans control everything in the state. Basically, the Ohio Supreme Court is forcing the General Assembly to draw maps that reflect a 54-46 Republican advantage, which would mean 7 D seats and 8 R seats, compared to the current delegation being 12 R seats and 4 D seats (Ohio is loosing a seat). Wish the courts would so the same in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon . . ."

As I recall, got more that 16% in the state in 2020, even more than 22%. Democrats have done a great job of rigging a system they hate, at least with Republican rig the system. Sure, Republicans probably went overboard in places like North Carolina, Ohio, and Texas, but give credit where credit is due. . . However, historical trends are historical trends. Only twice in the past fifty years has party in the White House gained seats in a midterm and there were exceptionally historical situations (i.e. botched Clinton impeachment in 1998 and 9/11 in 2002). COVID-19, especially when it become endemic later this year, probably does not have the historical power to reverse a powerful historical trend, at least not in the face of the radical agenda being pushed by Congress."

I would have to look more into that distribution, but many scenarios exist where Republicans are generally not that popular with median voters and still capture just 10 seats or more - enough to sustain a sudden defection or two by any Congressman privately disgusted with Trumpian politics. The cyclical shifts in ""enthusiasm"" (outrage) easily translate into the necessary turnout advantage against the party of a POTUS whose popularity is below 50%, where Biden seems likely to remain with his ""Honeymoon"" period clearly over."

Of course the party out of power usually wins and the base rate is extremely important in forecasting, so I might be committing the cardinal sin of base rate neglect, but I’m not sure 2022 will be an ordinary mid-term election with low turnout. Democratic voters are going to be well aware that Donald Trump will be running in 2024 and voting accordingly. At the same time, from the Republican perspective Trump will not be on the ballot in ’22, so their voters won’t have the same motivation to get out and vote. See for example the Georgia special election in which Jon Ossoff and Rev. Warnock won. That ordinarily should have been an easy victory for the party out of power. See also the VA gubernatorial race, which ordinarily might go to the Republican, who is a moderate and running during a time in which Biden’s popularity is underwater in an off-year election — except for the Trump factor motivating Democratic voters."
