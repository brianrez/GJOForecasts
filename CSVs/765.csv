His opponent, Greg Gianforte, is the state's sole U.S. House member. Gianforte has led Cooney in every public poll this year, usually by margins in the low-to-mid single digits.

Now, Bullock's departure is leaving the seat open. U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte won the GOP primary. The upside for Republicans is that Gianforte is a former tech CEO with deep pockets. The downside is that Gianforte is best known for assaulting a reporter, which resulted in a sentence of 40 hours of community service and 20 hours of anger management classes. Meanwhile, the Democratic nominee, Lt. Gov. Mike Cooney, is well-liked and has a long resume in state politics, including service as secretary of state and state senator. But that opens the door for Cooney to be attacked as a career politician. The latest independent poll, by the New York Times and Siena College, had Gianforte leading, 45% to 39%, with Libertarian Lyman Bishop receiving 4%. That follows a period of strong fundraising and aggressive campaigning by Cooney, and a risk-averse strategy by Gianforte. For Cooney to get all the way to 50% in a conservative state – and in a presidential election year in which a Supreme Court seat is at stake – will be challenging. The race is probably Gianforte’s to lose, but it’s close enough for us to keep it in the Tossup category for now."" https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/2020-10-13/analysis-republicans-look-poised-to-maintain-edge-in-governors-mansions"
