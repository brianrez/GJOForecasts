"Between 1 July 2018 and 30 June 2019, will an armed group from Myanmar engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Myanmar?",2018-06-27T17:00:15Z,2018-10-01T06:59:15Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],147,654,70,237,"The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (The EWP). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 30 September 2018 and will be resolved in July 2019 after EWP assesses the situation in Myanmar from July 2018 to June 2019. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilians fatalities occur in one or more campaigns.

The height of the killings appears to have been in and after August 2017, which is excluded from this question, and adds to the total estimate of killings which is put around 10,000. However, not only does that number include since the genocide started several years ago, but also does not discriminate between separate campaigns. There appears to be three separate campaigns (depending how EWP considers them, though they appear to be separate) that are made up of the Tatmadaw, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) and the ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) which have systematically targeted civilians. So, this means that EWP will likely only resolve this question as yes if 1,000 civilian fatalities occur in one of these separate campaigns, lowering the probability. Armed groups are also committing non-fatal human rights violations such as severe sexual abuses, burning villages down, and detaining and/or torturing civilians."

60943,2018-09-18T20:13:59Z,1,[60.0],[60.0],"In August of 2017, the Myanmar military murdered an estimated 6,700 Rohingya Muslims in the Rakhine State. In the next 6 months, thousands more were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced. Although the violence has died down in 2018, these events prove how quickly an armed group in Myanmar can perpetrate violence and kill large numbers of civilians. Recent international pressure, including a U.N factfinding mission accusing Myanmar of Genocide, indicate that parties may be deterred from acts of violence in the near future. However, the military maintains its power, acts with impunity, and tensions between religious and ethnic groups remain high. Thus, it is more likely than not that acts of violence against ethnic/religious minorities will resume before June 30, 2019."

Another such campaign would likely be met by some type of international action (most likely sanctions of some sort) and could create demands for a peacekeeping force. Neither outcome is palatable, I think, for the Myanmar government. I am rating this at 5% (the super-forecasting equivalent of “0”)."

Another problem in forecasting this issue is finding reliable data.
