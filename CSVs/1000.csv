Oil was last above $63 in early January based on the likelihood of reduced trade disputes between the US and China lifting global growth. The current depressed price reflects the growing global pandemic (COVID-19). May options (CME) are settling below $50 with only outliers showing a price of $63 (so if it does rebound quickly that is a big payout to whoever bought those call options). Between reduced travel hitting jet fuel demands to reduced travel hitting gas prices, oil will continue to stay low until fears of the pandemic subside or OPEC gets involved. Even if OPEC cuts production further it is unlikely to produce a 18.89% price change within three weeks."

Saudi Arabia is among the OPEC producers keen to raise prices quickly—the IMF estimates that the kingdom needs oil at $83.60 to balance its budget. Russia, which has allied itself with the cartel since 2016, has habitually opposed output cuts, only to agree to them at the last moment. To date the benefits of increased influence and business dealings with OPEC members have trumped complaints about production limits from Russia’s oil companies.

However, I still stand by my claim that the price will be above 69$ because this is where the price goes around this time on a consistent basis. In contrast, factoring the likelihood of an event that will increase oil prices would most likely push prices higher (crisis in oil nations push prices higher as supply chains come under question)."

Iran is the second biggest OPEC exporter - a war with the US will disrupt their GDP, so war is not desirable for them and I believe they will publicly posture with fluffed out feathers, but will privately avoid confrontation. My estimation that a war will breakout is lower than today than it was yesterday.

I also observed a trend in the data since 2015, wherin the price slowly rose afterwards. OLPEC may be dysfunctional, but it still raises crude oil prices. Meanwhile, if I am not mistaken, oil reserves in Saudi Arabia run dry, and thus their market share drops. In addition, demand for crude oil is rising, as it has been since it was first used.
