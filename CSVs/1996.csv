He is bringing awareness on topics like the equality of Muslin women in London. Kahn questions why women choose to wear a veil over their face, he fears that this is labeling a cultural difference in women who do wear veils. Making them appear different to others or be treated differently. Although the topic of banning full face veil in London has been brought up, Kahn has said that he is no one to tell others what to wear or how to live their life. I believe that his concern for the treatment of women in London is a great quality that he brings as a candidate. Although he is a an Islamic man, he;s personal beliefs don't interfere with the well being of others, even of a different culture. Another good quality that makes him a strong candidate are his beliefs of London, he states that there is no other city where he would rather raise his children."

So I don't expect any radical candidate to break through in London. The Mayor actually has few powers except for transport so the election is unlikely to attract voters who expect to change the world. The problems that the Labour Party has with splits in policies, although these are not particularly policies related to the job of mayor, are likely to reduce the enthusiasm of Labour supports who might struggle to understand what Labour now stands for. ZG is another rich posh boy, that sounds like a disadvantage in a city that naturally leans left but Boris got elected twice. We also need to take account of the fact that Labour supporters are easier to find on the street and more likely to be polled than Conservative supporter, so opinion polls are not reliable."

I adjusted the probability upward (10%) as the Labour party seem to have strong support in London, consistent with the notion of an urban-rural political divide in US, UK, and Canada, which had become starker recently. I also see SK's working class background and ethnicity as advantageous traits for garnering additional popular support, and a factor in mobilizing otherwise apathetic voters, at the same time, ZG's socio-economic background may isolate him from voters who do not share the same privileges, in combination, I assign a higher likelihood (5%) of SK's election. In terms of policy, SK's platform seem more comprehensive and detailed, and aim more towards affordability; ZG's seem more abbreviated, for anyone who actually look at the policies to make a decision, I think a better laid out plan would appeal to a completely neutral voter (2% for SK?)."
