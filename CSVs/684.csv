I do think the economic benefits of remaining a territory are sound. Folks will always act in their own self-interests and being a territory has financial gains. I also recognize the desire among others who could seek two more Senate seats given the looming Dem sweep. But it comes down to a matter of plurality support for statehood with a majority of voters actually participating in an election. Prior referendums were poorly attended and while support numbers were high, there was not a mandate for statehood. That said, I am also using this question as a test whether my assessment is biased toward past sentiments. Thereupon I would acknowledge I should have jacked my estimate higher. There is also a tendency for D administrations to be more sympathetic to PR issues, solidifying the notion that remaining a territory would restore advantages one could perceive as lost under a R administration - like Hurricane response..."

However, 2018 was PR's 6th time voting for statehood and every time a vote of Yes went forward to Congress, it was ignored. Also, the US has no formal process towards statehood. All these factors make PRs cynical of any Yes vote equating to support in Congress. The combination of a pro-statehood gov't in place in PR, the last three votes in 2016-18 were a yes, and the perception by PR that Democrats will lead America soon, I see a high probability of another yes."

I assume the advantages of Statehood are an immediate access to federal funds in times of emergencies of Hurricanes or global pandemics. They are citizens without the IRS, but 43.5% of people live below the poverty line and as such is poorer than the poorest US State. There is a move by the residents to move to the USA and not for the healthcare. The only advantage to remain a territory rather than a State is one of nationalism. Covid-19 is having the global effect on its economy exacerbating a bad situation created by Hurricane Maria, where federal help was slow (see link). The latest (July/August) poll showed 48% to become a State, 26% territory, 10% full independence and 16% decline to answer, from a poll of 1500 of a 3 million population. Non-binding referendums perhaps are perhaps considered meaningless and consequently have low turnouts. The suggestion is a majority vote for Statehood."
