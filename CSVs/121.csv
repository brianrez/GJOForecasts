I had thought my model was predicting slightly too many cases for today, but it's not. The current total is 8939, with the US still to report, probably ~100 cases. So today's total will be ~9000. My exponential growth model, with a doubling time of 11.68 days, had predicted 8992 cases for today. So I think a doubling time of about 11.68 days is about right. So, I'm adjusting my forecast back up.I think we'll likely hit 25k in approx 2.5 weeks and 100k by sometime around 8/18, possibly substantially earlier or a bit later depending on what cases are doing in the US and elsewhere.As always, the question is when case growth will turn from exponential or nearly so. I think it will be quite a while to come before that happens."

The current number is 8127, but the US can be expected to add ~100, and Spain hasn't reported; last Friday, Spain added 396 cases. Together, that would bring today's total to ~8625, but I would have expected 8992 for a doubling time of 11.68 days. It's still within the noise, but at least for now, I'll lower my forecast on the last bin. If today's total ends up at ~8625, that corresponds to a doubling time of almost exactly 12 days, which seems to be what the data keep bouncing around. That would put us at 197k by Aug 31. But again, US cases are likely to grow disproportionately, as testing becomes more available. For now, bin 5 looks most likely to me."

My model predicts 222k on 8/31. Of course, we don't know when case growth will slow from exponential, but I don't think it will slow much from exponential, if at all, by the end of August. Meanwhile, US testing will move from a 60/day capability to 10k/week starting in ""early July."" This could add a few thousand to the total, or 100k+. With all the sources of uncertainty (size of susceptible population, how much testing will increase in the US, how big the outbreak in the US really is, how much progress each country will make on controlling spread, etc.), I'm spreading my forecast nearly equally between the last 2 bins for now. I think <100k is extremely unlikely because I think the susceptible population is in the millions, and I don't see signs of control commensurate with what it would take to keep the total <100k."

It is consistent with the theory that I had held up until the last week, that cases would level off relatively quickly since this is what happens in most disease outbreaks, and cases are still relegated to MSM which means the total # of susceptible people is quite low, like 1% of the population or less."

But we've known for at least a couple weeks now that cases among MSM aren't being controlled sufficiently. And we see exponential growth in cases. It's slow, but it's exponential. It's possible that a larger-scale effort will be made to control spread in the near future, but on the course we're on now, I think we need to expect exponential growth. My toy model projects we'll see 86k cases by Aug 31. It could easily be off in either direction, but it strongly suggests that bin 4 is very likely. But, it's only 4 days of cases short of passing 100k, so I think bin 5 should be given a substantial chance, too. Here are my model's projections: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1467761"

So, taking cumulative cases on 6/3 = 900, about 70 cases/day on June 1, doubling time for cases/day = 9 days, we end up with 895k cases on 8/31/22. This is way faster than I think it's likely that spread is happening, and I would find it puzzling if this doubling rate primarily reflects actual spread rather than detection of an increasing percentage of cases. I also think it's likely that there's likely some substantial portion of cases not among MSM that is going undetected. Anyway, I think it's worth increasing the chance of higher bins higher than I had them before.https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1532759258403438592"

If community spread continues at anything like current levels, like we will be in the range of 10s of thousands, maybe higher, assuming test capacity keeps up (it won't). In any case I am going to flatten my probability distribution here due to my high uncertainty. 250k remains impossible unless r0 is >2, and test capacity is implausibly high. Keep in mind from the moment Covid was identified in 2019 until 250k global cases was about four months and incubation time/r0 is way more conservative with monkeypox."

The smallpox vaccine is now being offered to close contacts and healthcare workers in some locations; I had missed that yesterday. I'll allow a greater chance of bin2, but I don't think there's any chance of bin 1."

Clearly # is higher now or we would not be seeing community transmission all over the place, and numbers going up. UK resident had first monkeypox symptoms on April 29 and now we have 388 cases a month later. It seems like a decent number of these are tied to sex fetishist superspreader events (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/05/20/monkeypox-outbreak-doubles-health-authorities-set-announce-11/) so a few superspreading incidents early on likely led to the big increase, but this dynamic will not scale past certain point meaning observed r0 will likely go down."
