Hence, it could be sensible to assume that the lowest value would be 3 times that of Feb '22: approx. 495k. On the highest end, 700k encounters would mean an average of 233k per month, which is unprecedented. So I think the answer lies in between 500k and 700k.

The decrease from 2016 to 2020 was likely because of views on Trump and how his administration would handle things. Current average is ~150-180k per month so 400-550 seems like the high confidence range. I don't see any obvious seasonal trends. Staying below 400k would require an average of <133k and getting above 550k would require averaging more than 183k a rate we haven't seen since Sep 2021.
