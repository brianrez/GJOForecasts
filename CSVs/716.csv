Tikhanovskaya was unsuccessful in her campaign for president, however, many do not believe the results that were announced; “the country’s president, Alexksandr G. Lukashenko, claimed a landslide victory in a ballot that was widely denounced as fraudulent. Mr. Lukashenko, who has clung to power amid violent protests denouncing the election, had faced a surprising challenge from Ms. Tikhanovskaya, who became his fiercest rival” (Specia, 2020). After the election, Tikhanovskaya fled the country of Belarus which is widely speculated to be under the orders of the current government; “Ms. Tikhanovskaya, 37, on Sunday fled the country for Lithuania under what her associates said were pressure from the Belarusian authorities” (Specia, 2020). This is a claim that Ms. Tikhanovskaya make out publically and denounce, “‘I made this decision absolutely independently,’ Ms. Tikhanovskaya said in another cryptic video message on Tuesday” (Nechepurenk and Troianovski, 2020). The election has caused major uproars throughout the nation, sparking violent protests. Even though Ms. Tikhanovskaya claims she left on her own accord, it simply does not seem to be the case as she was also quoted urging Belarusians to accept the results of the election and “not to put your lives at risk” ” (Nechepurenk and Troianovski, 2020). While things are still unfolding, this does not seem like a situation that will be resolved anytime soon. As of now, I believe the most likely scenario to be Ms. Tikhanovskaya will not return before October 17, 2020, which I put at 70%, followed by 28% probability of her returning between September 4 and October 16, 2020. That leaves only two percent chance for her to return before September 4th. While nothing is impossible, I find it highly unlikely seeing how volatile the situation is. Update: Late September/Early October: Former presidential candidate has continued to put pressure on President Lukashenko, “the Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya will meet Angela Merkel in Berlin on Tuesday, as the standoff in Belarus increasingly takes on a geopolitical dimension, becoming one more bone of contention between Russia and the west” (Walker, 2020). Protests continue to happen throughout the country and Tikhanovskaya has motivated protestors by declaring herself the winner of the previous election, “Tikhanovskaya, who officially received only 10% of the vote in the election, has declared herself national leader, and wants to be a transitional figure until new, free elections can be held” (Walker, 2020). There is some speculation that Tikhanovskaya will return to Belarus, “Olga Kovalkova, authorized representative of former Belarusian presidential candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, believes that the politician will soon return home” (Tass, 2020). President Lukashenko also spoke on the matter in a very blunt and telling manner, “incumbent Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said he won’t allow to ‘give away’ his country even if he dies” (Tass, 2020). Both Tikhanovskaya and Lukashenko claim to be the rightful President of Belarus. However, as previously stated Tikhanovskaya left just after the election and has yet to return. Lukashenko has made it very clear he will not give up his position under any circumstance. With all of this in mind, it is my opinion that Tikhanovskaya will not return to Belarus before October 17, 2020, and I would consider that at 99% probability. The final 1% would be returning between September 4 and October 16, 2020, but once again, this is very doubtful. Specia, M. (2020, August 13).

With protestors remaining vigilant as of October 5, they were met with equally vigilant force by police and government security forces employing water cannons and detaining over 300 individuals (BBC, 2020). Svetlana Tikhanovskaya who fled hours after election results were released has recently traveled throughout Europe imploring for the EU to increase pressure on Lukashenko to step down, including speaking with Germany’s Prime Minister Merkel (Browne, 2020; Walker, 2020). While some countries including Great Britain have increased pressure by removing their ambassadors (RFE, 2020), more pressure is likely required collectively from the EU before her return as Vladimir Putin backed Lukashenko with a 1.5 Billion loan and offers of contributing police forces to combat protestors (Kudrytski & Kravchenko, 2020). Additionally, as of 7 October, Russia placed Tikhanovskaya on a wanted list for her role in Belarus (BBC, 2020). With the information discussed above and the 7-day timeline I estimate Tikhanovskaya’s return after 17 October 2020 a 99% probability."

But if she returns she would likely be arrested. But even if Lukashenko really want her arrested (that would be a change since he made her left and not long ago his servants were threatening another oposition leader trying to convience her to also leave the country) it is very unprobable that she would be blackmailed (they have her husband in jail) or in other way forced to come back to Belarus.

It would be similar to the option employed in Crimea, but very costly for Russia's perception in the eyes of Belarus people. Two, do nothing and hope that a pro-Russian candidate would replace Lukashenko—too risky.

Ms Tikhanovskaya won’t come back in this case (99% conditional proba here) as she fears for her security and that wont change: the violence and abuse used by authorities against protesters is not going away anytime soon [2].

Assume this has 7% chance of happening before Oct. 15th, probability LT returns under this scenario is 90% 2) Lukashenko remains in power - Tikahnovskaya left Belarus due to fears for her safety, and this is unlikely to change while Lukashenko remains in power.

He will try his secret police and propaganda tricks to quell the protests. May send a limited amount of little Green men to help. If that does not work he will get someone to replace Lukashenko who is never-the-less pro Russia. Lukashenko was not enough pro-Russia for Putin’s taste. I really thought Putin would have to rush but the dangers for him ate great so he will be careful. He may be able to deal with the coordinating council to get what he wants. There could even be elections as long as those running are all pro Russia. Anyone that isn’t will probably fall out a window. Each element will take time. 1. Support Lukashenko with propaganda and eliminating protest leaders. Try to divide protestors by playing up EU vs Russia loyalties. 2. Failing that working force Lukashenko out; get someone who will do Russia’s bidding to take over. 4. Have a sham election that is difficult to detect as a sham. Now I agree with crowd.

So he must have things set up so that it doesn't matter what people think, he's got an iron grip on the security forces, etc. The fact that he's been in power for decades also increases the likelihood that he is deeply entrenched. Tikhanovskaya bailed and left the country by choice, which, who can blame her, I would have too, think of the kids, but shows that ultimately she isn't up for sacrificing herself to be a symbol. Also, and this is subjective of course, I get a sort of vibe from her pictures that she is a survivor, not going to put herself in harms way unless there is a very big upside. I am comparing with Juan Guaido, who seems like more of an idealist, willing to die gloriously, and by contrast DID return to Venezuela (And a fat lot of good that's done so far, so maybe she looks at that and thinks, why bother). So she would probably return if there was a decent path to winning or having an impact, but...I don't think there is. I think Lukashenko just wrecks things for a while, and then loses control. So yeah. Things probably melt down in Belarus, some sort of transition may happen, but I don't think Tikhanovskaya is coming back anytime soon."

He might back them. He definitely does not want real Democracy there though. He is probably tempted to takeover to build the old Russian empire but Belarusians would resist. He has made no military move and the consensus is he won’t. More dead soldiers and resources sent elsewhere might cause him trouble at home. His best bet is to force out Lukashenko but keep some control over the media and state apparatus. They have elections in Russia and he could set-up an election In Belarus but could make sure only those aligned with Russia run. This will all take some time. If protests can continue for another week there may be negotiations. Another week to three weeks for that to be settled. She says she will be a care taker but not run. Russia might just ignore her or Russia will say fine but they are not leaving until they see elections have taken place. Media control? They will make sure a pro-Russia government takes over.

Lukashenko is cementing his position and refusing to negotiate with the opposition. If his tactic is to divide and rule the striking workforce by taking the factories one by one, he could entrench his position. Tikhanovskaya appears to be the titular head albeit staying in Lithuania, with her husband in jail that gives Lukashenko an advantage to keep the opposition divided. Moscow will be reluctant to criticise Lukashenko and will not allow Belarus to leave Russia’s sphere of influence shown by the re-manning of the TV company by Russian journalists and technicians. The public statements issued by the EU I suggest are hardening Russia’s stance on the situation although it is not the people being pro-west but anti- Lukashenko and claims concerning NATO probably being ignored. The situation appears to be very much in a state of flux given the messages on Twitter Belarus with an ebb and flow of positive and negative indications of the volatility of the situation. Therefore, the return of Tikhanovskaya is probably not imminent. Her BBC interview showed her to be a reluctant leader and perhaps more effective as a symbol rather a force to unite the opposition."

Right now, she and her family are relatively safe and can continue to release messages and coordinate with protesters and opposition leaders to inspire the people of Belarus to continue fighting.
