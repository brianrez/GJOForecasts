There is also currently a huge segment of the population that is blase at best about the cyber truck for it's perceived inefficiencies for being a truck. Additionally, it is not functionally useful in places without charging stations (aka rural midwest and great plains states; coincidentally, where trucks are bought en masse). All of this is to say that I expect very, very, very few Cybertrucks to be manufactured, much less delivered to consumers. Being based in Austin Texas is cool but irrelevant to me.

Now that they have nearby battery production promised (without the need to importin the midst of COVID back-ups at ports), the odds of them getting production ramped up is improved.

I'm assuming some improvement to their ramp abilities by now though. If they really did get started in Q4 of 2020 that could mean about 84k deliveries if they matched model 3. But if they don't get started by Q1 of 2022 there is a good chance they could do less than 25k.

At full capacity, these plants are expected to be able to produce 500,000 vehicles per year. The Austin facility is projected to produce a similar number of vehicles once in full swing (https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/blog_attachments/gigafactory.pdf). However, Tesla’s TOTAL vehicle production will probably amount to about 500,000, in 2020 which is far less than the capacity of each Gigafactory (https://www.statista.com/statistics/715421/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-production/). This is due to a few factors, most importantly the availability of lithium-ion batteries."

Also humans are generally overly optimistic about how quickly they can complete tasks and projects. This can be backed-up by Tesla and Musk-things generally having historically overrun anticipated timeframes. Therefore I wouldn't be surprised if the factory and production process doesn't get completed until late or after 2022, meaning a zero or few trucks being produced. If however the factory and production process is finalised well before the end of 2022, they could/will ramp-up production quite significantly, and will be producing at a decent rate by end-2022. Therefore I think more chance of over 100K trucks being made if the factory is completed with enough time left in 2022. I don't think demand or actual delivery will be much of an issue or inhibitor once production is underway, and so anticipate the timing of factory completion being the primary variable."

So assuming Austin is ""up and running"" as an auto plant by the end of 2021 will the 4680 production gear also be up and running to feed it. Not clear if the existing cell technology can be substituted given that the battery pack is viewed as a structural element which depends on the 4680's size and shape. Thus this is an all or nothing gamble and as stated the 4680 depends on some technology still in development today. There are numerous newly developed elements each with a probability of completion by end of 2021 required to build the CT in volume. This is nothing like the Shanghai plant development which did not depend on new technology to build the first Model 3."

With the Neuralink interface HW4.0 could inform your cortex of a FSD event it could not handle and position your head, hands and feet to take control of the vehicle directly.
