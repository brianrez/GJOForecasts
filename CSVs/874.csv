Over the past two weeks, the average is roughly 289,000, and in just the past week it is 316,000. Add in the fact that every politician is incentivized to increase testing to re-open safely, and before May 31 is a fairly safe bet."

Assuming that tests are still in production for 3 weeks and that during those 3 weeks the average conducted tests are 1.75 million, we reach May 16th with a total of 10.5 million tests conducted in total. One factor we have to take into consideration is that the costs of these tests are decreasing, or at least they will be, and they will be made more accessible. The combination of easier accessibility, lower cost, and increased screening lead me to believe that the U.S. will pass 15 million testa by the end of May. However, having seen the lack of a national guideline on testing different perspectives may slow down testing and its efficiency which is why also consider the first week and a half a plausible date for the passing of the threshold."

My estimate is that the number of tests (according to my logistic model) will be between 6 to 7 million. The real number of infections, if asymptomatic and mild cases are included, of course, is much higher, but due to limiting factors - number of kits, equipment, PPE, trained lab personnel... - it is not reflected in number of performed tests."
