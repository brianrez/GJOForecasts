Looking at the last time the quarter-on-quarter U.S. GDP growth rate was negative, which was Q1 2014, I also saw estimates of first and second quarter growth at around -10% and -25%. Considering the unprecedented rise in the unemployment rate, consumer spending, foreign trade, and other financial/economic factors influenced by COVID-19, I would now increase my forecast to 95%. Since last week, jobless claims surged and BofA economists forecast that the unemployment rate will soon hit 15.6% from 3.5% as of February, which would by far outstrip the unemployment rate during the 2007-09 recession. “The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.68% has lost 25% year to date through Thursday. That includes a first-quarter decline of 23.2%, which was the worst one-quarter performance for the index since the fourth quarter of 1987.” A deep global recession in 2020 is now Fitch Ratings’ baseline forecast according to its latest update of its Global Economic Outlook (GEO) forecasts. Bank of America Global Research also said it expects the COVID-19-related recession in the U.S. to be the “deepest recession on record,” nearly five times worse than the postwar average."

Imports increased”. -Additionally, as COVID-19 cuts through the economy, IHS Market forecasts a 2nd quarter GDP growth plunging to -13%, GDP contracting 1.7% in 2020 (year over year), unemployment approaching 9% by December, and inflation slipping to 1.3% in 2021. JPMorgan dragged its first-quarter growth estimate to -10% from -4% and dropped its second-quarter estimate to -25% from -14%. -“One way to compute this is to cumulate the difference between GDP in this updated forecast and GDP in the most recent forecast that did not show significant effects of the pandemic. Using this method we estimate that, over the next five years, the pandemic will cost the economy $1.5 trillion (2012 dollars) in foregone GDP. Hence, the cost of the pandemic continues to rise even after the economy regains full employment, albeit at a much slower pace than during the recession itself.” -It is important to stay current on foreign growth, energy (essentially oil prices), consumer spending, auto shutdown, unemployment, initial financial conditions, monetary policy, and fiscal policy, when considering GDP growth and forecasting economic costs/changes during the COVID-19 pandemic."

So there is real business/economic hurt that can come from this - maybe a 25% haircut to any one quarter's GDP growth - but not QoverQ negative growth. Further argument for a moderation on the effect of Covid-19 on US GDP statistics - and acknowledging in advance the unreliability of the medical and business data coming from China - there is tangential evidence that the country is returning to work (meaning ""supply chain"" effects will be less in the months ahead), and that the rate of growth of incidence of the disease is decelerating for the Chinese population at large (meaning""consumption"" and ""consumption patterns"" will return to near-normal later in 2020). I note (possibly in error) that between start (late Dec 2019) to ""finish"" (end of Feb 2020) seems to suggest a 60-day period where Chinese business and social activity underwent dramatic change, after which a new normal began to be established, with recovery to follow.
