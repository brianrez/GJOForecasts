The conventional reason not to choose a running mate from the same region (heck, metropolitan area) of the country would not apply to Gov. Christie, as Mr. Trump clearly does not follow conventional wisdom. Furthermore, the conventional reason to choose a governor-- bolstering the ""executive [governing] experience"" of the ticket-- would presume a hands-on partnership in the West Wing that I cannot imagine Mr. Trump tolerating. Attn. General, yes, especially in the wake of the Lynch-Clinton meeting, but not Vice President. Gov. Christie would occupy too much of center stage, as Vice President Cheney did. Mr. Trump has to be THE man. Fmr. Speaker Gingrich, on the other hand, knows how to manage Capitol Hill (at least in theory), an aspect of the Presidency for which no recent candidate has expressed enthusiasm. The pathetic performance of the past two Congresses has also become an issue with the electorate, giving Gingrich a possible leg up on his apparent competition. Multiple marriages clearly do not matter. If they did, we wouldn't still be talking about Mr. Trump."

Is Lewandowski's exit a sign that the call is imminent? Jeff Sessions a likely pick as he agrees with Trump's position on most things but articulates them much better. He'd be a good corner man in the tough weeks ahead, although it's questionable whether he'd make Trump any more electable. Christie's nomination would be the kiss of death for both men and Kasich has too much to lose by accepting the post."

There are some other governors out there, but (a) many of them are smart, effective, and ambitious, all drawbacks from Hair Boy's point of view, (b) their states are likely to vote R anyway, and (c) they are less well known than Christie. He might go for Bob Corker or some similar Senator. Another possibility is somebody obscure but novel like Ros-Lehtinen, the rigidly unthinking Cuban woman who is a Republican Representative from Florida and therefore ticks just about all the boxes. Or, to put it another way, who the hell knows?"

Scott Walker: 4% - http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2016/04/13/scott-walker-literally-laughs-out-loud-over-trump-vp-suggestion-n2147620 John Kasich: 12% - would make the most sense for Trump out of all the candidates, but there are so many other candidates including Gingrich, Martinez, Haley, Ernst, etc that would work for Trump.

In only 2 of those elections - 1980 and 1948 - was a former candidate selected for VP. There are arguments to be made here as to what period should be considered given how the nomination process has changed, but (admittedly based on a small sample) the base rate is low, in the 10-20% range depending on when you want to cut off the data."

Kasich To put it bluntly, everyone who ran for the republican primary couldn't even get republicans to vote for them, so how can they be expected to attract votes in the general (maybe with the exception of Kasich, who would probably alienate some republicans but win some independents)?"

Rubio might have worked out, if they got on better, but Rubio has already said he would refuse the VP nomination, if it were offered by Trump."
