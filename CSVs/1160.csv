Although I think the current forecast takes into account the attack by suspected dozo militias on a Fulani village that killed around 160 people in March, it doesn't account for the recent spike in attacks by suspected Fulani herdsmen against dozo communities. As a result, I will raise the forecast by 2.5%. I raise the forecast by further 2.5% due to the spreading the influence of Islamist militias, which have links to the Fulani militias and have the capacity to inflict heavy casualties on Dozo civilians."

The first is that there are numerous Armed Groups operating in the region, sometimes with different and sometimes with shared goals and territories. Further, the lines between “jihadist” and “non-jihadist” armed groups are very blur. Fighters often pass back and forth between all types of groups, based on their convenience. The cooperation between non-jihadist and jihadist armed groups is rife. This fluidity has led to frequent allegations that both pro-government and formerly separatist or non-jihadist armed groups have collaborated with various jihadist groups. Given the ongoing shifts of the security and political situation in the region, any attempt to map this multitude of groups is by its nature inexact. However, it is less likely that 1 k can be attributed to a specific Armed Group."

In march, gunmen killed around 110 people in one of the most deadly attacks on civilians within central Mali in a long while. Growing presence of Jihadist and extremist groups is to blame for the recent killings, which are likely to grow into more killings. Growing tensions between Islamic State and Al-Qaeda forces in the region will lead to civilians getting mixed up in the conflict and killings of civilians as ways to retaliate. These groups are also taking advantage of ethnic tensions between groups, where ethnic conflicts tend to lead to a large number of deaths. https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/23/world/africa/mali-dozens-killed.html"
