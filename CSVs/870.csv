Test submissions that error out of the system due to data quality issues will not be counted until they are successfully resubmitted and pass validation requirements. Additionally, Total Tests will no longer include faxes or aggregate counts received by various labs since there is not a timely way to complete data quality checks. """

This simply doesn't seem to hold true. Chile and Louisiana are two regions which have peaked and stabilized on a lower level, but the problem is the number of new cases daily in those regions are still higher than the threshold for 200k new cases for a given week in US. If the US cases were increasing in the same proportion as in Chile and Louisiana it will still be above 200k new cases for a week (Chile 220k new cases, Louisiana 357k new cases). Louisiana is far ahead of the curve so even if their numbers go down now (which I expect) other states is lagging behind and will keep the numbers up for the coming month.

This has caused a major rift and the development of distrust in the CDC, Dept of HHS, and the WH amongst the medical and public health community in general. Couple that with the push to test less for political purposes and we may actually see a HUGE decrease in testing in the coming weeks. Most states are pushing back on these ideas, but not all of them.

The average hasn't been this low since mid-June, and while it is likely that cases will continue trending down and the average may, in fact, drop below this for the entire October-December range, this question requires only that one week meet the 200,000 cases mark. Children are returning to school en masse, several large gatherings have occurred in recent weeks that drew attendees from around the country, and testing of asymptomatic people has been dismissed by the CDC. With all this in mind, I believe it is more likely the cases will increase than decrease at least for a time. A previous Monte Carlo simulation assuming an average around 40,000 put the likelihood of a single week greater than 200,000 is around 90%, I think it is slightly less likely now than then but I see no reason to decrease my projection by a significant amount."

However this forecast period is for October, a period starting 3 months from now. The current levels will cause behaviour change between now and then. In Europe cases have dropped back a long way after 3 months. Even if there is a US peak to come it’s unlikely to still be 3 months away and there is a lot of time for cases to plateau as they have done in other areas. Let’s assume the US compares to the whole EU (broadly the same population), and assume the US follows the EU with a lag of 3 months. The EU is about 3 months past a peak and has plateaued around 5k cases per day, which is 25k per week. Close the the 28k needed for this forecast but still lower. Restating that this is a risky, borderline forecast, but the probability of hitting 200k in a week between October and December is lower than it is in the next 3 months. Of course the US election is early November giving time for any infections generated on that day to manifest, and for pre election campaigning to spread the virus, but I genuinely think people will be more careful by then. But will have to revisit view on this interaction as well as the likelihood of people travelling for thanksgiving. Sticking with 30pc for now."

In the fall, many will return indoors in the North as it gets colder, contributing to spread. 200k new cases a week is less than 600/state/day, and we are seeing that level of spread even in smaller states (1000/day now in NV, AL, MS). This period could see a resurgence in NY metro as well. A vaccine is highly unlikely by this point, much less at enough scale and efficacy to make a difference in general population immunity.

Political resistance to limiting economic freedoms (ie forced closures) are antithetical to the Republican party's beliefs and are economically harmful. This makes lock-downs hard to support/implement. Further compounding this resistance is that Trump will be out for re-election in Nov 2020. Because of this, my prior is that new cases can and will continue to spike. I believe that governors will eventually shut down (I estimate in a month) as the virus forces business closure. Therefore, I believe that cases may spike to 190k. This is below the 200k asking so I will tilt towards < 50% probability for my prior.

I believe “pandemic fatigue” will be a significant factor in the decisions for both, particularly as we become more accustomed to (and comfortable with) routine reports of deaths in the thousands. The course of the pandemic so far suggests that undetected (untested and never reported) community spread can require a significant time period (months) before resulting in the kind of widespread transmission that can’t be overlooked. Testing and and contract tracing are the key tools to avoid this trap, but there isn’t nearly enough of it occurring, and that seems likely to persist, given the lack of support and coordination being offered by our federal government. It’s hard to imagine a scenario where there won’t be enough “hot spots” in the US between October and December to reach a threshold of 200,000 cases in any one week."

If this is true of entire NYC population of nearly 8.4 million then already 1.67m have been infected with vast majority recovering. Roughly translates to 10 times confirmed. Similar random testing of 863 individuals in Los Angeles yielded a seropositivity for antibodies rate of 4.65% implying over 365,000 adults (a far higher ratio than 10 times) had been infected compared to the reported confirmed 8430 infections by the date of testing (April 10th 2020). On the other hand, Data based on county wise analysis of impact of various state wide social distancing measures shows the potential for affecting transmission ranging between 10 to 35 times. Since these measures are being relaxed, but people are using common sense to reduce exposure (masks, distancing, changes in schools, workplace, sports limitation), we will see a slower transmission and hopefully a lower viral load exposure causing immunity without the high mortality. From all above, expect that by October over 35% or 1/3 of the population will have been exposed (going from a 5 to 20% exposed now based only on adults without including children and ongoing slow transmission and 5 months till October) which would decrease the number we are trying to predict for Oct to Dec Also currently the majority of deaths and symptomatic infection is in older adults and in certain settings such as nursing homes. So leves behind a smaller proportion of the most vulnerable population who would get symptoms which would decrease this number However if testing for antibodies becomes ubiquitous, then testing a large number of population (currently less than 5% overall) would pick up several infected individuals and we could easily identify more than 200k cases in one continuous 7 day period. If states and businesses mandate testing (both viral and / or antibody) and that is considered as a confirmed new case, then the probability would be much higher. If a new case is defined in such a way as to consider antibody positivity as prior infected and not new case, then our probabiility would be lower. Going forward, i would revise the probability up or down based on changes in definition, availability of testing, regulatory requirements for businesses to operate and social behavior as seen on media.

The US is currently experiencing about 22K new cases per day or 140K cases per week as the virus impacts other areas. While its entirely possible to go back to 30K new cases per day I hope that new habits of mask wearing, distancing and reluctance to form large groups will prevent a return to the 30K daily rate of new cases.

There is only the consideration of a very efficient medical treatment which will maybe Covid19 into a marginal threat, so that contracting it doesn't need to be avoided any longer. Same would apply for a vaccination that it primarily distributed to risk groups allowing to ease social distancing for a majority that is not vaccinated. But I believe this to be unlikely and slow."

The team of AstraZeneca and Oxford University have come out with an adenoviral vector based vaccine against the spike protein which is fast tracked.

I´m convinced, that some kind of genetic resistancy plays a huge role here. It was about 80% of the world population with the spanish flu.

While the chance of (2) is real, the chance of (1) is very little because even dumb people are naturally loss avoiding and if they see too many friends and relatives getting sick they would ultimately collectively step on the break."
745,2020-04-18T15:02:40Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],"This is a tough one for the following reasons. The likely scenario wrt mitigation efforts is that they will be moderately effective. Right now, on April 18 we are getting roughly 30,000 new cases a day. Given the current testing problem in the US, that is surely a severe under count. Let's suppose it is off by an order of magnitude, and we have 300,000 new cases a day. Since some of the 30,000 cases per day self-present and are not picked up by testing, that suggests many cases with moderate symptoms. Those with mild symptoms self-quarantine and/or do not infect people now given the lockdown. Some people we know have no symptoms and would only get identified if they were randomly tested. So, suppose we now have 300,000 cases per day, or 2.1 million per week. If that is the case, it really depends on whether we are testing enough people in the Fall of 2021. I think testing will increase, not because the Federal government wants more testing, but because there will be demand for testing and antibody testing that will increase the test supply. If we have sufficient testing, I think we could have a 7 day period with over 300,000 cases. My analysis suggests there will be that many new cases, but my uncertainty is whether there will be that many tests."
31275,2020-04-18T14:55:04Z,1,[27.0],[27.0],If we loosen up by June and July and cases spike up to a second surge we might be back in lockdown by then. The testing should be better so hopefully if people are out and about we can manage the infection rate better. Who knows?
27661,2020-04-18T13:55:20Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"Nothing is impossible but I assume that people will be cautious and conscious enough to follow the appropriate measures by then (distancing, wearing masks, hygiene). This concerns in particular those that work in jobs that are the most in danger to get an infection. In addition, I imagine there will be strict measures put in place by the authorities as soon as an infected case is registered."

We are currently seeing roughly 200,000 cases per week. All indications are that Trump and his supporters want to see a full return of economic activity which is the basis of his re-election campaign. Political cynicism suggests that if the economy comes back and he wins its ""good"" for Republicans, and if the virus rebounds and he loses he leaves a crisis in the hands of democrats who can then be blamed for any fallout which is ""good"" for Republicans. This leads me to believe there is a high probability of a second outbreak in the fall due to pressure to open up the economy prematurely for political gain."
