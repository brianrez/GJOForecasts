He has stated that it is not the quantity of comments, but the quality, which suggests that they will likely not have an effect on the outcome. He has also indicated that this is a fight that he intends to win. There is a large disconnect between public sentiment and the agenda of people who are making these policy decisions, but ultimately whoever makes the policy will win.

Title II is the law that is the most efficient at reigning in broadband providers. It is possible to protect net neutrality using other laws besides Title II, but even the FCC sees the bait and switch coming if they go that route. If the FCC ceased regulation of telecommunications companies' broadband services, consumers would be forced to join a cartel. I believe the broadband providers and the FCC know the final verdict will be reduced regulation under Title II, rather than ceased regulation. Even the uninformed consumer would ask questions when their preferred media slows because it is owned by a different provider than they pay every month."
