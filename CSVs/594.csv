However, the other two percentages for support are 68% and 68.8%, which can be interpreted as ~57 seats for both percentages. The variation is minimal, but it is safe to assume that polls can underestimate or overestimate the results, so having less than 50 seats or more than 65 is unlikely, but still possible."

La ultima de las encuestas publicada a inicios de febrero ubica la intención del voto con 68% a favor de NI. Se ha criticado el débil rol de los partidos de oposición, que se mantienen con muy bajos porcentajes en las encuestas. Bukele ha mostrado un afán por controlar particularmente el poder legislativo con el que ha tenido enfrentamientos durante su gobierno. Y si consideramos la tendencia regional de gobiernos autoritarios y débiles oposiciones, es probable que NI obtenga la mayoría de escaños. Pero también debe considerarse que cada vez hay mas opiniones publicas criticas hacia Bukele que muestra rasgos autoritarios."
