A few days ago Connecticut just had its credit rating downgraded to “deep junk”, just a few months after the city’s credit rating was last downgraded."

Nobody wants to be in office around election time when your bonds have become junk--not only do your borrowing costs go up instantly and dramatically, but there is a major sell-off of existing debt by agencies and entities who are not allowed to hold junk as part of a capital requirement; this includes, for example, all the public retirement systems in Illinois and I imagine a fair number of banks. And while most voters don't bother to understand this, they almost always get the idea that it's pretty embarrassing--and if you're an incumbent, it's at least partly your fault."
