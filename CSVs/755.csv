Based on the several charts on that page, I discovered that temperatures have indeed been increasing. However, a rise of 1.5 degrees seems to be unlikely. Another question that needs answering is, what is the 20th century average for a 12-month cycle? This information is found at (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/global/time-series/globe/land_ocean/all/3/2000-2020) where I discovered the data on different temperature anomalies since 1900. This chart shows however, that a rise of 1.5°C has never happened yet. The highest anomalies like that occurred in 2017 so far, and they were only up to a whopping 1.12°C. I don’t believe that it is likely we will have a 1.5°C anomaly occurring within the next year. Therefore, I will confidently place my prediction at 0%. I will wait for more information to appear."

29102,2020-10-29T13:17:50Z,1,[45.0],[45.0],I believe we are at a tipping point. Over the past 40 years predictions of change due to climate have usually been low because the science had not caught up with reality. The science is still not perfect but the evidence provided by actual measurements seems to say that we are somewhat behind the curve on predictions. I believe that the earth will warm more than 1.5 degrees C for a month or more within the next 5 years; within the next year maybe not but the increase is not linear and probably more of a power curve. But despite any statistical analysis a tipping point would send the earth into uncharted and un-chartable territory. It would take years that we may not have to predict where the climate is going.

Además, el dato para enero 2020 fue de 0,6°C, mientras que para junio fue de 0,9°C.
