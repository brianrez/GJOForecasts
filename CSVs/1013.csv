"Before 1 May 2020, will China reduce or remove any tariffs imposed on U.S. yellow soybeans?",2019-12-06T18:00:22Z,2020-02-15T07:59:34Z,Yes,"['Yes', 'No']","['Business', 'Economic Policy']",372,654,156,237,,https://www.gjopen.com/questions/1416-before-1-may-2020-will-china-reduce-or-remove-any-tariffs-imposed-on-u-s-yellow-soybeans

Recent articles such as the Foreign Policy article on 14 Feb below state that China ""cut"" tariffs on soybeans, but others like the CNBC via Reuters and FX Street on 17 and 18 Feb reported that China is granting tariff exemptions on soybeans. There seems to be some confusion on the exact status of the tariffs. If anyone is seeing anything different, let me know."

I assess that the coronavirus strongly incentivizes China to work with the U.S. on reducing/removing tariffs to minimize the economic impact. I am unsure if China has fully removed the soybean tariff as stated in the Foreign Policy link below or has agreed that they will do it.

That it is indeed a cut in tariffs means that this meets this question's criteria. I expect this question to close out on 14 Feb when China puts these changes in place. With this source clarifying the situation, increasing the odds of this happening by 30% from previous assessment. Very small probability that China changes its mind in the next 24 hrs."

INCREASING the odds that China will actually make permanent cuts is the fact that the US and China are progressing with a multi-phase trade deal where both sides are indicating willingness to compromise; also, Brazil's current bumper crop means that Brazil beans are going to be cheaper, so it may actually cost China nothing to lower tariffs on US products because they're not competitive anyway yet it will show a measure of goodwill in the trade war. Thus, it's more likely than not China will take advantage of this situation and permanently reduce the July 2018 soybean tariffs (though probably not by much)."

In particular, exemptions and waivers will not count towards this question. And waivers of tariffs seemed central to me to how the Chinese government will bring in soybeans from the US without breaking those importers' P&L. Given US tariffs are staying in place through the 2020 election, and this matter having an established tit-for-tat methodology - I see nothing that compels China to feel the need to actually reduce tariffs. And an early reduction of tariff broadcasts, without near-certain reciprocity by the US, would, to me, Chinese bargaining weakness. So a low single-digit possibility seems appropriate."

The Treasury Department will make the move in a semi-annual report, expected to be released soon, after being delayed as the U.S. and China finalize a “phase one” trade pact, the sources said. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in August first formally labeled China a currency-manipulator. That prompted authorities in Beijing to increase transparency around how they manage the yuan. Some of that data has provided support for Treasury’s view that the People’s Bank of China engages in competitive devaluations of its currency, the people said. The administration had at one point considered maintaining the label and instead announcing it would monitor the yuan with the possibility of lifting the designation in August of this year, according to the people. ——————- COMMENT: Keeping the same for now.

As Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He stood face to face in the Oval Office on Friday, a reporter asked whether the agreement was for $40 billion to $50 billion in purchases every year. Trump turned to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and asked him to “define that, please.” “It will scale up to an annual figure. Yes,” said Mnuchin, who later added it would hit that higher level “within the second year."" A spokeswoman for the U.S. trade representative said Thursday that China had committed to $40 billion to $50 billion a year, “scaling up over two years,” implying purchases would be significantly higher by 2021. ========== China is picking up soybean cargoes in Brazil, dashing hopes for big American sales immediately after a partial trade deal is signed with the U.S. next week, according to people familiar with the matter.

Consequently the domestic demand for soybean has declined in China. China has also begun import of soybeans from Brazil and increased domestic production to meet the demand. Higher import tariff on US soybeans would not yield much revenue because of the reduced imports. Also higher tariffs would increase cost to domestic farmers already reeling under the impact of swine fever. A reduction in tariff is beneficial to China and would go a long way in appeasing Trump who has a substantial support base among US soy farmers. A reduction in tariff need not result in higher imports from US farmers though. So net gain would be China's favour. Hence I expect China to reduce tariff on US soybeans before May 2020."
