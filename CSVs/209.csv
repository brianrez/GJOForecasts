He won the Australian open recently after an epic 5-sets against Medvedev, against the odds and after a break due to injury, and covid. And then won again in Mexico. It seems the top players can benefit from a short forced break. So the case against him is whether he can maintain that winning streak at this late stage of his career, and whether Djokovic, Tsitsipas, Medvedev or someone else could create an upset. Perhaps Djokovic could some into form after missing Melbourne entirely and going out in the 4th at Dubai."
