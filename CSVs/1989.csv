Error is about 4 in each, averages probably about 2 in the aggregate for a standard error. Chance Kasich is 2 points lower or more is about 15%. If he goes down 2 points, Trump probably goes up by most of 2%, but probably not quite enough to win. So call it 10% chance Trump is really in the lead and polls are sampling wrong. Kasich is very well known in Ohio, so late breakers should already know if they want to vote for him. Same issue with Trump, I think he does not do well with late breakers. Lastly, Kasich has momentum so this may mean late breakers side with him. Trump weekend kerfuffle probably makes him weaker and polls may have missed some of that. Bump Kasich up a little, but I'm disinclined to go much above 90, especially given polling errors in Michigan, so I'll stay at 90 or maybe even move down a little. 1% for Cruze seems too generous, but then I remember the Michigan polling disaster."

For a guy who won every county but one in his last race for governor, he should be doing a lot better. I think the problem is immigration, and his stance on the ""path to legalization."" Immigration is the big issue for the Republicans this year, and a great ground game and statewide organization is a handicap if you have taken a position that's at odds with the majority of voters. Kasich's outreach is just telling people that he believes in a policy that most of them disagree with. I think it will be close, but I think Trump will win. People will vote their rust-belt economic interests and their white working class ethnic demographic interests, both of which Trump plays to."

The party establishment seems to be making more than a nominal effort on Kasich's behalf[4], though - honestly - that's not proved to be of much value so far. However, a new PAC-based anti-Trump add running in Ohio right now does look like it might have some impact[5].

I see little reason to believe that Kasich's popularity has had anything to do with his probability of winning the nomination. Arguably, that probability has increased now that only one other 'moderate' is left in the race. Very hard to imagine a meaningful proportion of Kasich voters switching to Cruz for any reason.
