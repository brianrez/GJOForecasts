The UAE is heavily dependent on international travel (expats, tourism, extended layovers), so if the economic damage becomes bad enough, the UAE might relax restrictions, dramatically increasing the chance of a COVID resurgence. However, UAE officials might stop testing for or at least reporting new cases to encourage travelers to return to the country (or convince citizens to resume normal commercial activities). The question says ""reported"", which means that if there are actually new COVID-19 cases but JHU is unaware of them, then technically there could be a span of 14 days ""without new cases"".
