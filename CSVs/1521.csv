"In Carpenter v. United States, will the Supreme Court rule that investigators' warrantless use of Timothy Carpenter's cellphone records was unconstitutional?",2017-11-03T17:00:52Z,2018-06-22T17:00:36Z,Yes,"['Yes', 'No']","['Society', 'US Policy']",535,654,350,237,"In 2016, U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit ruled that prosecutors legally used historical cellular phone location records obtained without a warrant to convict two men, Timothy Carpenter and Timothy Sanders, of armed robbery. Those men contend that the seizure of those records without a warrant was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court is expected to hand down its decision in its current term, but if it does not, the question will resolve as no. Confused?

The current law has characterized call-detail records as “non-communication content” thereby not subject to the 4th Amendment. The only other case where a number of exceptions were raised was the Jones decision where the mitigating factors were attributed to GPS-data and “long term” tracking; neither of those factors apply to the Carpenter case since it is based on cell-site data which is less accurate than GPS and the historical tracking does not fall as “long term”.

They violate the Constitution in multiple ways. They are a very very very slippery slope to the authoritarian overlords both Republicans and Trumps want to be! There was no good reason not to seek a warrant. This is about protecting the Bill of Rights! And punishing sloppy police work. Or it should be.

Stevenson Research Professor at George Washington University, wrote regarding the case in The Washington Post that ""it’s not an exaggeration to say that the future of surveillance law hinges on how the Supreme Court rules in the case. information from the cell phone provided the FBI's basis to petition for judicial orders under the Stored Communications Act (hereafter, SCA) to obtain call and cell phone location data held by Carpenter's and Sanders' cellular service providers. The SCA did not require the government to show probable cause or to obtain a warrant in order to obtain the data. In April of 2011, police arrested four men in connection with a string of armed robberies of stores in and around Detroit, Michigan. The stores were Radio Shacks and T-Mobile stores. During police questioning, one of the suspects confessed that the group had committed robberies of nine stores in Michigan and Ohio over a four-month period from December of 2010 to March of 2011. During these robberies, the suspect informed police than an additional 15 men, alternating across robberies, served in various support capacities such as serving as police lookouts and as getaway drivers. The suspect forfeited his cell phone to FBI authorities, who examined the phone's call records for additional information. In May and June of 2011, the FBI applied for three different judicial orders in order to obtain transactional records for 16 different phone numbers gleaned from the suspect's phone. The evidence the FBI sought was for records that ""included '[a]ll subscriber information, toll records and call detail records including listed and unlisted numbers dialed or otherwise transmitted to and from [the] target telephones from December 1, 2010 to present[,]' as well as 'cell site information for the target telephones at call origination and at call termination for incoming and outgoing calls[.]'"" The orders were granted pursuant to the Stored Communications Act (hereafter, SCA). Under the SCA, the government can mandate the disclosure of certain telephone or telecommuncations records if ""specific and articulable facts show[] that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.” Prior to a federal trial on various charges, the petitioners, Timothy Ivory Carpenter and Timothy Michael Sanders, moved to suppress the evidence obtained by police under the SCA-authorized judicial orders. The petitioners alleged that the cellphone records could only be obtained via a warrant issued by a judge and supported by a showing of probable cause. The trial judge, Judge Sean Cox of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, denied the motion.[7]"
