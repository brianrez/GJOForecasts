Qatar also seems unlikely to drop out of the process in the near term, as crux of the respondents' argument is a claim to a national security exemption from trade laws, which is a sort of fringe exemption and a clarifying ruling could be beneficial to Qatar."

This was the first step in the WTO's trade dispute process, triggering a 60-day deadline for settlement or face potential WTO mediation and litigation, including potential retaliatory trade sanctions, a process which can take years to reach conclusion. The first deadline is September 30. Given several ongoing diplomatic efforts to lower tensions and find the right mix of concessions that would allow both sides to claim victory, and all parties' reluctance to see this dispute disrupt global energy markets, I would forecast a very low probability that the WTO establishes a dispute settlement panel by November 15, preferring to allow diplomacy and consultations as much time as needed to work."

The sanctions imposed, especially by Saudi Arabia, have put a stranglehold on imports needed for full functioning of the country. The Gulf Cooperation Council is putting a stranglehold on Qatar for supporting the wrong terrorist organizations. Qatar's counter-move to involve the World Trade Organization is one of their last traditional options and shows the sanctions are having the desired effect. Qatar has a choice between kneeling to western interests and the GCC or become an isolated peninsula with one land border, with Saudi Arabia, which would become a non-ally if Qatar decides to go the independent direction. Pride would be the fall of the nation. I still believe the Gulf Cooperation Council countries will work it out before a formal dispute settlement."
