Still, if we assume that Uber has driven ""millions of miles""[3] to be between 2 and 10 with a skew toward the lower end and we add in numbers from other companies, we have a highly fragile fatality rate of 1 fatality per 20 million miles (this squares somewhat well with non-autonomous numbers; see below). - I estimate about 10m miles to be driven during the period in question (based on Waymo numbers, growth rates, and California numbers for Cruise). - Naive fatality estimate (non-autonomous): 10m miles / (1.25 fatalities / 10m miles) = 1.25 fatalities - FWIW, Tesla autopilot seems to be involved in about 8x fewer crashes per mile than regular cars. [4] Assuming that the L3 - L5 is comparable, this would push down the estimate significantly, and may partly explain the lower rate calculated above. On the other hand, estimates by @3V_Money seem to suggest that accident rates are higher actually. - Based on this, a median between 0.5 and 1.25 fatalities seems about right. I'd expect variance to be quite high, given the low numbers involved. Based on the Uber fallout one would expect the operations of any company involved in any accident to be heavily curtailed. Since Waymo and Cruise are the main companies involved, three or four accidents seem highly unlikely. One would also expect safety to improve all else equal. Based on this I plugged in some rough numbers that seem right."

Data is limited, but let’s presume their accident rate is half that of human-driven cars. There are 1.09 deaths per fatal crash and 1.25 fatalities per 100 million miles driven. So the number of fatal crashes (regardless of number of fatalities) should be 1.09 fatal crashes per 100 million miles driven. That would be .545 fatal collisions per 100 million miles. At the high end of my estimate, 20 million more SD miles this year, that would be .2 * .545 = .109, an 89% chance of no accident and an 11% chance of 1 or more. The chance of 2+ fatal SD crashes is less than 1%."

According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_self-driving_car_fatalities there has been one fatality last year and no fatalities prior to that. A very rough extrapolation would yield two accidents for this year. However, we are only looking at 10 months and linear extrapolation of rare events might not be the best model. In order to correct for this, i also give a considerable amount of probability mass to 0 and 1 accidents.
