The COVID virus is likely to persist for the next couple of months if not up to a year (https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-will-coronavirus-end/608719/). SpaceX and NASA have since delayed launches that were scheduled for late this month (https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/spacex-encounters-first-launch-delay-due-to-coronavirus/). However, as of March 18th NASA has invited the media to attend the launch event in May. NASA claims to be monitoring the event but since a week ago, COVID-19 has spread rapidly in the United States, from 4,000 cases on March 16th to 60,000 cases on the 25th. Additionally, Space X itself has been hit by the COVID virus (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/spacex-one-medical-employees-in-hawthorne-test-positive-for-covid-19.html). In non-COVID related news, the last test before sending humans into space aboard SpaceX rockets encountered a critical engine malfunction during a test (https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/spacexs-latest-starlink-launch-included-an-unforeseen-engine-issue/). The failure will require a thorough investigation, which must be completed before the human boarded launch.

I believe that the world is underestimating COVD-19, especially the United States. With all of the uncertainties, it is very likely that the launch will be postponed to probably in the fall. But, I think the decision to postpone will be very difficult because NASA has been talking about this launch for a very long time. Currently, workers at NASA have been told to work from home and Elon Musk has told workers to not come into work if they are feeling sick, in a way that shows he is downplaying the severity of the virus. The NASA administrator has stated that the agency will keep on moving with important space missions. With all of these uncertainties, it seems that NASA and SpaceX do not know what is the best course of actions, therefore it is likely that the launch will not occur before July. https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186511/spacex-nasa-crew-dragon-astronauts-launch-may-international-space-station"

SpaceX is a private company that is investing a lot into space travel and without the presence of the COVID-19 virus, the July 1st deadline for SpaceX to launch the first crewed mission into orbit would be completely feasible. According to a recently published article, SpaceX is taking action to limit the impact of the virus and therefore state that they are confident that their launch schedules would not be impacted. Although the company is confident, there are many uncertainties surrounding the virus, its impact on the economy, and how SpaceX will be impacted by it. However, I chose a percentage that was slightly higher because, as of today, President Trump announced that he would like to have the economy back up and running within two weeks (15-day plan) rather than in months. Because of that, there is now a slightly higher chance (75%) that SpaceX will not be severely impacted by the Coronavirus and therefore may meet its July 1st launch date. https://www.space.com/space-industry-coronavirus-spacex-1st-crewed-launch.html"

This routine launch was significant because it is “the final resupply mission for NASA under SpaceX’s original contract with the space agency”. Now SpaceX will begin its work with the new Dragon 2 capsule which will be used to send people to the international space station. I suggest a 1% chance SpaceX will launch before July 1st this year, which is significantly lower than my previous prediction. Why? Axiom Space, “a company with ambitions to develop a private space station, announced March 5 that it has signed a contract with SpaceX for a commercial Crew Dragon mission to the International Space Station. Axiom said the mission, scheduled for launch no earlier than the second half of 2021, will carry one Axiom professional astronaut and three private astronauts to the ISS. The mission will last 10 days, including eight at the station and two in transit. The company did not disclose terms of the deal, nor pricing for the individual private astronauts. The flight announcement comes as Axiom works to raise outside investment. Suffredini said in that earlier interview that the company is in the process of raising a Series A funding round on the order of $100 million, which it hopes to close by the beginning of summer. The contract is the second deal for a commercial Crew Dragon mission announced in less than a month. Space Adventures announced Feb. 18 it had an agreement for a Crew Dragon mission launching between late 2021 and the middle of 2022. That flight, carrying four private astronauts, will not go to the ISS but instead fly in an orbit more than twice as high as the station. “Thanks to Axiom and their support from NASA, privately crewed missions will have unprecedented access to the space station, furthering the commercialization of space and helping usher in a new era of human exploration,” SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said in the Axiom statement”."

SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule arrived on Florida's Space Coast on Thursday (Feb. 13), and now Technicians can start prepping the vehicle for the launch that will kick off Demo-2, a test mission that will send NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken to the International Space Station (ISS). SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule aced an in-flight abort test Sunday morning (Jan. 19), successfully jetting away from its Falcon 9 rocket less than 90 seconds after liftoff and demonstrated the spacecraft's ability to keep astronauts safe in the event of a launch emergency, marking a big step on the path toward crewed flight. In terms of the astronauts capabilities, Behnken and Hurley have been working closely with SpaceX on the Crew Dragon's development since 2015, so they're well equipped to fly the spacecraft. In total, the two astronauts have worked together for two decades. As of 17 February 2020, Falcon 9 has achieved 82 out of 84 full mission successes (97.6%), so it is sound to say they have a dependable record regarding safety and mission performance."

According to the wiki, SpaceX will test the Flacon Heavy (based on Falcon 9) Merlin engines prior to flight, so we will know by late April or early-May if it passes the preflight tests. My first estimate is therefore based on SpaceX's success rate. My only thought will be the non-launch related impact of Covid-19 on the launch facility staffing and space program. I would expect the crew and back up will be put into preventative isolation for up to six weeks before launch. If the launch facility is closed because of it, however, there will be no flight. Therefore the only revision to my estimate will be based on Covid-19 pervasiveness, and not Space X's ability to conduct the mission."
