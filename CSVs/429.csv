""It's not clear how many people could be immediately affected. More than 830,000 households in New York State, the majority of them in NYC, are behind on rent, with a total estimated debt of more than $3.2 billion"" The report in the NYT quotes a state senator who says it appears landlords could start filing suits immediately to evict tenants. But a patchwork of other state and federal protections remains in place that could stop their suits from succeeding, including the CDC eviction moratorium which includes all of NYC. About $100 million, or less than 4% of the state's $2.7 billion total has been spent from federal relief dollars given to NYS.(NYT) The money is there, it's a matter of the state and city getting it together to process applications.

The average from the data file for prior years is 223k, or about 19k per month. So, a simple exercise of YTD (23,596) plus the average for the remaining five months gets you to 116,590. This seems like the most appropriate starting place. However, a look at the data for 2020 before COVID (through March 15) reveals that near term numbers were already 30% below average.
