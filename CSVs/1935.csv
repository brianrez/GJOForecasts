It appears that the drop in the price of the pound has not stimulated industrial output (not a surprise to most economists who had already noted that in an economy like the UK's. changes in exchange rates no longer have a very great effect on output figures for manufactured goods. In the UK's case lack of available capacity and disinclination to invest in increasing it due to economic uncertainty is only being partly offset by increases in service activity. Larger inflation increases due to the fall in the pound are forecast. I had thought the effects might reach the 2% by the end of 2016, but it now looks more likely that the 2% figure will not show up until Q1 or even Q2 2017 (an annual rate of 1.7% for 2016 now seems more likely)."

14493,2016-10-28T17:07:35Z,6,[40.0],[0.0],The pound has dropped by about 20% since June. UK inflation went up from 0.5% in June to 1% in Sep. So it appears that the drop in the pound in July had added 0.5% to inflation by Sep but price rises were still working thru the system and should add another 0.5% by Dec. In addition a second drop in the pound could add another 0.5% by Dec. A question is how long the price increases will take to work thru. My guess is that businesses have held off increases but as they start to come in the momentum will build and price rises will speed up.

While all are below 2% GDP and 2.5% inflation, it's not unlikely that the estimates for GDP could be low by 0.5 for either the US, UK, or Germany. These numbers get revised a lot as new data comes in, and since we only need one of them to beat the 2% GDP mark, I think there's a decent chance that happens. Not likely, but not insignificant either. The inflation numbers all look much further from target, though, so I don't expect that any of them would be relevant."

However, to get to this growth rate, the US economy has to accelerate significantly in H2 2016 after the very slow growth in H1 (1.1% in Q1 and 1.2% in Q2). Even if the Atlanta Fed's GDP Now forecast of 3.6% in Q3 is accurate, and this repeats in Q4, the annual rate won't surpass 2.5%.

Of the two components to the question, increasing inflation is more likely than increasing GDP. I don’t think any G7 country can expect GDP growth of more than 2.5% but there are several scenarios that could trigger higher inflation although I don’t think that central banks in the G7 countries will be able to increase the inflation rates above 2% as they have employed many techniques to achieve 2% inflation over the past 2-3 years without success. One exception may the UK. Depending on how the Brexit referendum is resolved and possible de-coupling from the EU, it is possible that the UK could see 2% inflation by the end of the year. Overall, I think deflation and GDP reduction are more likely than growth."

The base effects will be meaningful. Also, if the UK votes to stay in we could see them reach 2.5% GDP although the Q1 print will be weak so it's more of a stretch. No other country will come close to hitting either threshold unless we get a oil supply shock (unlikely) or Japan decides to experiment with chopper money and that leads to accelerated inflation (also unlikely)."
