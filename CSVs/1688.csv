31450,2017-05-04T16:41:08Z,1,[100.0],[100.0],Moon is well ahead of any other candidate. I accept that polls are averages with margins of error but the size of the polling miss would be unprecedented for him to lose at this point. And yeah there is Brexit and trump but polling in the UK is notoriously bad and even there the miss was less than 4 points and regarding trump the national polls were correct in predicting a 2-4 win for Hillary (she won by just over 2 points) who only went on to lose because we still pick winners using a ridiculous system more akin to a tribal federation than a modern democracy. Point is polling just isn't wrong by enough for Moon to lose.
