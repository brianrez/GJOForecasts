It reached a high of 6.8597 per USD on January 13th, 2020. China has also been under pressure from the USA to reduce its control over its currency. However, with the outbreak growing and China increasingly becoming closed off from the world economically, the CNY weakened some to a 2020 low almost 7.0000 per USD in early February. This is a difficult forecast without any precedent. China's GDP is forecasted to fall to 4.5% growth according to a Reuters poll of Chinese economists (likely biased high). If the official numbers are this low or even lower than I expect the CNY to weaken to above 7.0000 per dollar. If the outbreak is quickly contained and GDP growth is between 4.5% and 6% I expect the CNY to stay fairly stable at just under 7.0000/USD. The potential of the coronavirus outbreak getting worse and GDP growth to be very low cannot be ruled out hence the 7% chance of the CNY dropping all the way down to 8.000/USD. https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/USDCNY:CUR https://www.thebalance.com/dollar-to-yuan-conversion-and-history-3306089 https://www.macrotrends.net/2575/us-dollar-yuan-exchange-rate-historical-chart https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-economy-poll/chinese-economy-clobbered-by-coronavirus-but-set-to-recover-soon-reuters-poll-idUSKBN20801H"
