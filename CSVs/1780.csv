The question is if they want me to be prime minister… The odds of me becoming prime minister, are perhaps not in my favour, but I’m confident that if we get the result, according to the current polls that it is a real possibility.” But Mr. Wilders admitted it was possible other parties could refuse to cooperate with him, opening the way for a minority coalition to rule although he could command the largest single party. A similar fate could await his colleagues in other European nations, he said, but even if Marine Le Pen in France and Sebastian Kurz in Austria failed to top the ballots in 2017 the populist revolution would carry on going. http://www.breitbart.com/london/2017/02/11/wilders-whatever-happens-2017-populist-genie-bottle/ __________________________ COMMENT: Because of the upsets of Brexit and Trump with the polls, it is becoming so difficult now to make a forecast on these, and considering the times we are living it becomes even more difficult."

The last politieke barometer as a prediction was at 19.1.2017 (http://www.ipsos-nederland.nl/ipsos-politieke-barometer/barometer-van-deze-week). So I start with this numbers: currently there is no coalition between three parties possible, because they need 76 seats in the ""Tweede Kammer"" and the best coalition would only get 72 (VVD, PVV, CDA or VVD, PVV, D66). Then there are 19 possible coalition between 4 parties. All of them need participation of VVD and PVV. Currently they would both get 27 seats so even if they come together Wilders would not become PM. Beside this the current PM Rutte said that the chance of a coworking between PVV and VVD would be 0% (http://nos.nl/artikel/2153087-rutte-kans-op-regering-vvd-met-pvv-is-nul.html). There are also 24 coalitions between five parties possible. 14 of them would be also lead by VVD but that mean there are also 10 under lead of PVV. 4 of this are together with PvdA and they do not want to work together with PVV (http://nos.nl/artikel/2152980-pvda-voorzitter-spekman-henk-en-mark-zeg-nee-tegen-de-pvv.html). Remain 6 under lead of PVV but they also all need CDA as a partner and they made bad experience with PVV in cabinet Rutte one from 2010 till 2012. And also one of the politicians from CDA said, that he would will go, if they work together (http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?news/2548851263/CDAer+Ren%C3%A9+Peters+uit+Oss+samenwerken+met+PVV+uitgesloten.aspx). But I did not found a clear statement against it, so maybe it is possible. I think coalitions with 6 parties are not able to work together. So I get 5 of 43 coalitions that would be lead by PM Wilders mean 11,6% possibility. From there on I would correct at may to 13% because there is also the possibility that 6 parties work together. And then I get my numbers out of a prediction and there are still two months to go to the election, so maybe PVV is getting more seats than VVD what would change my model again. So I correct the 13% to 18% because of this. If you have any suggestions or something that other politicians said, please reply.

It is the leading party, but to be PM Wilders not only needs to be leader of the leading party, but to be able to form a government. 76 seats would seem to be needed to have a government with a majority so the PVV would need to be part of a multi-party coalition. As the PVV is regarded by many (maybe most) Dutch voters as toxic it would probably struggle to form a majority coalition. The VVD (the party of the current PM and close to the PVV in the polls) has ruled out joining with the PVV in a coalition. The VVD would probably find it a lot easier to build a coalition without the PVV. Although it is usual for the leader of the party with the most seats to become PM, this assumed that this party will be able to form a government. Events in the next eight weeks could change things, but its unlikely to change that much. http://www.forbes.com/sites/marcelmichelson/2017/01/16/dutch-elections-could-turn-into-cliff-hanger-over-populist-party-eu-attitude-at-risk/#1ef768ec1b5d"

Even if one suspects him to increase his 12 seats from 2012, he would need to be the major partner of the coalition to become prime minister. Combining his chances of winning an overall majority on his own (which I would put at most at 0.5%, as he would need to increase his seat share by a magnitude of 6) with his chances of becoming partner in a majority coalition, which I would still only put at 2% because all parties refuse to make a coalition with the VVD. The most suitable partner - VVD - has declared it won't make a coalition with Wilders and is losing many seats compared to 2012. He stands at best a chance of just over 2% of forming a government - alone or in a two-way coalition. As all parties refuse to govern with him and the Dutch electoral system represents many smaller parties, the odds of him forming a coalition with more than one party are smaller the more parties would need to be involved. Thus I would reduce it to 1.5%. But the fact that if he were to get a coalition organised, the PVV would most likely be the major partner and therefore win the position of prime minister. That makes me raise it to 2% again. It is also interesting that the PVV's performance has not improved since the Berlin attack, which makes me doubt whether a renewed terrorist attack would help raise the PVV's seat share considerably. In any case, it would need to be a big shift to overcome the odds and gain an absolute majority. If anything, previous elections have shown that his party tends to underperform on election day compared to opinion polls, which further reduces his odds - down to 1%."

If he wins in a landslide maybe the lure of government will tempt some other party to consider. http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2016/12/geert-wilders-pvv-stretches-lead-in-latest-poll-of-polls/

The end-of-year poll, an amalgamation of data from five of the country’s leading pollsters, shows that Mr Wilders would win 31-37 seats in the 150-seat parliament. This would give his anti-immigrant, anti-Islam, anti-EU party the support of 20-25 percent of the electorate. http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/geert-wilders-extends-lead-in-polls-ahead-of-dutch-election-1.2914769 Dutch Freedom Party leader Geert Wilders tweeted a provocative photo of Angela Merkel with blood on her hands as he blamed Europe's 'cowardly leaders' for a 'tsunami' of Islamic terrorist attacks. In a previous tweet, he wrote: 'They hate and kill us. And nobody protects us. Our leaders betray us. We need a political revolution. And defend our people. #BerlinAttack.'"

11096,2017-01-11T19:47:20Z,1,[3.0],[3.0],"External rational: Untill date 81 political parties registered for the national elections of March 15. The Netherlands have a history of multi-party cabinets. The average time it took with the last 26 national elections (since 1945) was 72 days (in a wide range). The IPSOS-results forcast like 29 seats (from 150). Internal perspective: Even when PVV (Geert Wilders 'personal' political party) would take 40 seats he would have the first right to try to form a government. But there would not be a chance that he could form whatever kind of cabinet, because nobody in the Parliament trusts him and (almost) nobody wants to work together with him. There is not an official agreement of a 'cordon sanitair' but practically there is. Realistically spoken he only could form a government if he would win more then 75 seats and be a potentate. Or he would have to be the party with the highest number of seats and have the initative to form a cabinet. Winning > 75 seats < 1 % even if I correct for my 'just-world-bias' . This scenario only could happen in case of an not-so black swan (serious terrorist attack) in the Netherlands before the election day from IS or another group that could be linked to 'Muslims'. But 'only' becoming the biggest party in the House of Parliament - with 40-60 seats - I would say a small (but not neglect-able) change of between 3 or 5%. The closing day of this question puzzles me and might be most important part of just prediction and our Briere-scores."
