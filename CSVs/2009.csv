14493,2016-10-07T10:31:07Z,8,[0.0],[-8.0],I don't see any evidence of 6 party talks being planned. Between now and 1 Jan 2017. I don't see Obama agreeing to talk now. The track record of previous talks suggests a negligible chance of success. By agreeing to a new round of talks now the probability is the talks would just fizzle out with no substantive outcome. Why would Obama want failed talks to be one of his last acts as US President?

Kim asked scientists and engineers to make ""preparations for launching the satellite as soon as possible on the basis of the successful test,"" the official KCNA news agency said, indicating the North may soon launch another long-range rocket. The test was conducted amid global condemnation of the North's fifth nuclear test earlier this month and a call by the United States, Japan and South Korea this week for greater pressure on Pyongyang over its disregard for United Nations resolutions banning missile and nuclear programs (para 1-3)."

Nevertheless, concerns about the threat posed by North Korea have spiraled since it conducted its fourth nuclear explosion in January and followed it up with a series of missile tests despite severe United Nations sanctions. Also, three major factories known to produce machine parts for North Korea's sanctioned nuclear and missile programs have been modernized or expanded, according to analysis of recent satellite imagery seen by Reuters, a further sign of its commitment of scarce resources to weapons (para. 1-3)."

In any case, progress towards the objectives of the talks could be made via various bilateral talks or indeed by other means entirely. China could exert pressure without six party talks ever occurring or the five parties could impose sanctions without North korean attendance etc. Even if North Korea was to return to the table this might happen via the UN or IAEA without the resumption of these six party talks.

In this English translation, it doesn't look like a no-first-use doctrine, but more like stand-your-ground. If they feel threatened by another nuclear state, they'll nuke up (if they can come up with a vehicle that actually flies). The other state doesn't have to use the nukes, as I read this, but only to own them and to do something that Li'l Kim defines as encroaching on DPRK sovereignty. That's why I'd feel better with some linguist input.

Despite the sanctions placed on North Korea by the UN, there is a low likelihood that North Korea will rejoin six party talks because Kim Jong Un has declared that he will never join them again after 2009."

Tensions between the two countries have increased as North Korea has begun developing and testing missiles in an effort to create nuclear weapons. To find a diplomatic solution, there have been several attempts at peace talks between the 6 most involved countries, the United States, North Korea, South Korea, China, Russia and Japan. North Korea has joined and withdrawn from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty on multiple occasions. Talks between the countries restarted most recently in 2003 resulting in a pledge by North Korea to denuclearize in 2005. However, by 2009 these agreements had broken down after a North Korean rocket launch. Since then, North Korea has said it will never rejoin negotiations while the other countries still claim to be open to negotiating."

The five other countries said they would re-talk if North Korea was willing. A regime change could happen or another wildcard which could change the outcome entirely. I think that this is a 8% chance of happening because there is a low chance of Kim Jong Un being helpful to other countries and he has shown that he is against cooperating with the six countries through peace talks.
22851,2016-03-24T01:53:34Z,1,[6.0],[6.0],"The five parties excluding North Korea are all willing to discuss this nuclear program, however North Korea isn’t willing to come together and discuss these things, as they showed in 2009 when they claimed that these six-party talks wouldn’t ever happen because they don’t believe that they needed to happen. However, there is still a chance that a regime change may happen before then (most likely with the passing of Kim Jong Un), which might open them up to discussions regarding their nuclear program."

In the near term, the best that the international community may be able to accomplish is to prevent North Korea from gaining additional technical knowledge or acquiring materials for its weapons program by enforcing Security Council sanctions. The long-term goal should be to welcome North Korea back to the nonproliferation regime and address its security concerns, thereby eliminating its impulse to possess nuclear weapons in the first place. --- http://nationalinterest.org/feature/north-koreas-nuclear-program-irreversible-15537?page=2"

I think China's willingness to join sanctions will hinge on how much Kim alienates and ignores China's attempts to bring him to the six party talks. Russia's role may be an interesting factor, especially if the Syrian and/ or Ukraine negotiations with US/ EU either improve or deteriorate drastically. I think N Korea may test another ballistic missile, giving Beijing reason to join sanctions, eventually causing N Korea to return to talks in exchange for sanctions relief. Perhaps without a missile test in the near future S Korea and US would be willing to join China in 6 party talks before Jan 1 2017. As a side note, I find the history of borders and territories in NE Asia very interesting, especially considering how Russia's former western borders and influence with EU have shifted along with its economic deterioration. I wonder if any Chinese hawks dream of Russia returning Manchuria and China creating a NE economic corridor through N Korea to S Korea. I wonder if Putin considers selling Alaska to US at cents per acre another historical mistake like Ukrainian independence. When the price of oil rebounds and the Arctic eventually comes back into play (along with NE passage for freighters), the Bering Strait will prove an interesting choke point strategically."

As NK claims to have an H bomb it seems too late to stop this development. I don't see why Obama would want to end his Presidency by restarting talks that seem to have very little chance of getting anywhere. On the other hand NK seems to conduct its foreign relations by, when its economy is in a particularly dire mess, engineering an incident (nuclear bomb, rocket test, shelling etc.) that outrages other countries and then demanding 'gifts' (food, oil etc.) South Korea and China might go along with this again, but the US has probably been let down too many times to want to go through this process again. NK is reported to have had a very bad rice harvest in 2015, there must be food shortages in 2016 before the next harvest comes in.

From 2003-2009, six-party talks went back and forth with no final agreement. In 2014, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov indicated that North Korea wanted to resume talks. However, 2015 brought no movement towards the resumption of talks. Outside view: When talks were happening, the average was about 1 round per year for 6 years (2003-2009). Total of 6 rounds. But there have been zero rounds in the last 6 years. The numbers indicate another round is due. Based on this reasoning, I'd estimate 30% for resumption by year end. Inside view: However, the difference in leadership since the last talks and the recent nuclear test make resumption of talks seem less imminent. In addition, the complicated relationships between the U.S, China and Russia make things harder still. In terms of domestic politics, it's not clear how much diplomacy the Obama administration is willing to devote to this issue in the last year of power. Although if there is to be any significant impact of the 'pivot toward Asia' one might be tempted to think that Obama's team would be pursuing some progress on North Korea. Still, these things would have to happen early in the year for talks to get underway in time for some kind of new framework. I'm estimating these thoughts are worth about a minus 15 (-15). That leaves me at 15% for now."

Japan has previously said that it has no intention of resuming six party talks, although they ultimately reneged on that.

It is not acting in belligerence and realizes that weapons bullying will not result in aid as it has in the past. I’m not sure how long this strategy will last for. I suspect there is a greater chance of six party talks this year. The key is aid for North Korea. I think North Korea's aid is more important than its pursuit of nuclear weapons or missile launches. These aren't real security measures to protect the state. North Korea needs money more than anything to keep the army happy. I believe that they will want to go back to negotiations and there is a higher probability of six party talks than most other forecasters think. North Korea may be trying a new strategy to receive aid."
