From Economist: “ Regardless of which side fired the warning shots that sounded along the disputed India-China border on Monday night, the use of firearms marks a serious escalation. The two countries have been locked in a standoff for months. In June a gun-less brawl in which at least 20 Indian troops were killed quashed what little trust was left. Both sides began massing forces. An Indian raid last month at Chushul, supposedly to pre-empt a Chinese move, riled China by using a Tibetan-manned unit to capture territory. Over decades, agreed protocols at the border included forbidding firearms and keeping heavy weapons to a minimum. Now Ladakh is one of several fronts where the two countries are locking horns. Last week India banned 118 Chinese apps. A day later, India’s chief of defence staff hinted at starting “freedom-of-navigation operations” in Chinese-claimed waters in the South China Sea. Old understandings seem to be crumbling fast.”"

Tensions had been building and have resulted in a violent clash of soldiers armed with rocks and clubs. (Weapons are not allowed as per earlier agreements). China was understood to have been aggrieved over India’s decision to strip Kashmir of its special status and also to the road and bridge infrastructure, while China involved itself in earthmoving activities and redirecting the river that defined the border. Although India became very vocal about the arguments and transgressions, China downplayed the affair, signalling a low importance. Both sides have pulled back their troops, with the Indian Prime Minister, Modi, denying any loss of property to the Chinese. Given the present climate of Covid-19 pandemic and economic issues confronting the two countries and the lack of advantage to be gained this time by either side, the skirmishes are probably locally inspired rather than inspired by Delhi or Beijing. The potential of a lethal confrontation between the armed forces of either side should be considered extremely high given the volatile nature of the local tensions, but an escalation into a major conflict is very low. As the question defines a lethal confrontation to be at least 1 and therefore, I propose a 50% of a lethal confrontation of any kind."

After a weak Indian response, the Indian people in this area are outraged. Also, India has invested a lot of infrastructure into the area, and they are not going to want to let China keep seizing more land. China will ALWAYS keep seizing land along the southern border. Honestly I would imagine there's a lethal confrontation within a week from now. It appears like both sides are arming and supplying themselves, and just tried to downplay it for a moment to strategize."

Line of Actual Control (LAC) has been contested since 1962 war. Last major conflict was in 2017. Latest conflict in the Galwan Valley, was fought hand-to-hand (weapons not carried, by agreement), on very rugged terrain. Most fatalities were from falls down steep slopes. So base rate difficult to determine, but generally less than one incident per year. Current tensions are high, and both countries are expanding into the area. India recently built road, China expanding tank forces. Prediction window is short, only 90+ days. Area becomes inaccessible during winter. I'll start at 45%, but adjust down very quickly."
