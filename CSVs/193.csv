The professional forecasters are little more circumspect, with only Sabato edging out of toss-up territory to lean Republican. This is an R+2 district according to Cook, it's a midterm election, and the President is a Democrat, so it seems like this one should be pretty easy to call, even when you factor in the, um, ""candidate quality"" issues with Hines. Anecdotal reporting from the ground seems to indicate a pretty split electorate. I wouldn't bet 3-1 on Hines, but I'm not calling this a toss-up, either. 60-40, Hines."
