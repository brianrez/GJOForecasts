Myreading makes points me to the following: Back in the90s and early 2000s when the talibs were last in power the UN provisionally kept the previous administrations representative to the Afghan permanent mission to the UN by deferring their decision on a new representative. When ever the taliban put forward credentials the decision was deferred. This could happen again if the world doesnt think that the taliban has instated a representative govt (it doesnt seem to necessarily be a democratic govt).

Yes, they have wanted that in the past and UN recognition would legitimize their rule. It is a small possibility that things get so chaotic and unstable that they do not get their act together to present credentials, but it appears to be a straightforward process and doable in 35 days. Will the credentials be accepted? Probably not. 35 days is not enough time for the Taliban to establish changed behavior from their past rule. The argument can be made that the UN would want stability and Afghanistan to not be a haven for terrorists of all kinds. It appears they cannot control ISIS and as for stability that would take time to demonstrate. Western democratic governments would also have political problems at home if they were openly in favor of a government that came to power by force, does not recognize women’s rights and other basic human rights. Middle east and Islamic dictatorships may also be leery of recognizing a government that will provide a base for terrorists. What I would like to know is if the previous government will make a claim as the legitimate government in exile."
