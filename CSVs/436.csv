And the individuals we have sanctioned have been done based on fact of human rights abuses or breaking trade laws (approximating here). Finally, since the beginning of COVID and into the current administration, where the US has pressed the Chinese government a bit and scientists for answers, it hasn't held China at all accountable. The US, I don't believe will have an appetite to do that now based on all the other events and conversations happening with China, such as Taiwan reunification."
104049,2022-01-17T16:10:37Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],The current administration has been less aggressive with China related to COVID. There is also a relative lack of clear evidence to pinpoint the source of complicity for Chinese individuals or corporations.

And when this might happen then not before 1 July 2022. But why I do think that way? 1. We still have a pandemic situation and certainly we still will have it when July 2022 comes around. As long politics is dealing with the pandemic itself, there is not so much attention going into political activities of the PRC. When the pandemic is over however and political actors and scientists are more looking into the origin of the Corona virus (I personally think - at the moment at least - too much points towards the lap leak hypothesis to completely rule it out) and all the censoring and covering up by Chinese authorities and politicians will come under much more scrutiny, but not so soon. Scientific and political analysis and its results will still take some time. 2. When I think about sanctions, which have been imposed in let's say the last ten years, then terrorists, war criminals, Nord Stream 2, crimes against humanity, money laundry or other activities of organised crime and such come to my mind. And all these are purposefully committed with excessively and continuing brutal force or, in case of Nordstream 2, have serious geopolitical ramifications and when it comes to crime and organised crime, then sanctions come into place when politics is too much entangeled in it. None of that is true for COVID and how the PRC is dealing with it. That doesn't mean the CCP isn't trying to use the pandemic for political gains but that is something what many other political actors also do and what is (unfortunately) part of the political game. So I'm not expecting COVID-19 related US sanctions against China within the next half year. Please let me know what you thing of my thoughts especially when you disagree or think I've missed something. Thank you!"
77455,2022-01-14T17:01:54Z,1,[2.0],[2.0],I think sanctions are highly unlikely given the economic impacts it could have.

Marshall Releases Path Forward on COVID Origins Investigation and Holding China Accountable, https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/sen-marshall-releases-path-forward-on-covid-origins-investigation-and-holding-china-accountable/). Given the current higher profile topics on Capitol Hill of the pending budget crisis and $3.5 Trillion spending package, any discussion of holding China accountable is going to disappear almost completely from the news cycle (as if it hasn't already) and the attention of the US government. It is not likely to regain traction after the current debates are settled as there will be the next thing to focus on, not the old thing that few of the current elected officials really wanted to address anyway."

Getting evidence by hacking the Chinese servers is very unlikely as China had enough time to remove any evidence, and even such would exist it would be treated as a top secret and heavily protected, with very low chances to penetrate the firewall. And finally, in case US Intelligence report comes to conclusion the Covid originates from the Wuhan lab, would Biden administration make it public? Would Biden want to bring Sino-American relations to a breakpoint, making China responsible for millions of human casualties and trillions of dollars spent fighting on Covid? That's unlikely that Biden would risk a political and economic WW crisis. There is also the possibility of closed doors discussions between Biden and Xi Jinping during October G20 summit in Rome.

A tacit acceptance or a low Chinese reaction could suggest China is responsible for the suffering caused by pandemic. This could push US, China and probably EU and Australia, into a new trade war spiral. All the developed economies are based on a global free trade environment. A large scale trade war will not help, especially coming after the Covid crisis. Economic and social conditions would be negatively affected and the post-Covid positive trend curbed. Secondly, such action should be supported by a strong evidence. Getting this is not possible without China's cooperation and international inspections at Wuhan, which is largely considered as the epicenter of the pandemic. So far China was not open for a dialog on this subject. Even China will change its stance, there is a low probability that any evidence to proof the virus originated from Wuhan laboratory would be found. US sanctions without evidence could create a two-edged precedent. China can also bring the case at Hague international court. An outcome favoring China in a China against US case would oblige US to step back otherwise the sanctions on Russia for Crimea annexation would also come under a question mark. This is only one case. US administration probably will withdraw the sanctions, Bidden isn't Trump. And that would be a bad note for Biden. Probably he has plans for a 2nd mandate. And btw, Biden's counselors might not even like to further push into an action initiated by Trump, which might give him political capital. As of 2021-Jul-7 there are is no public evidence that would indicate a higher probability for this action. Still, there is almost a year till 2022-Jul-1, and the situation might change.
