Hwasong-14 and -15 were tested in 2017 and are in operation - so no need for further testing. Hwasong-17 was tested as recently as last year (twice). In a parade on February 9, 2023, 11 Hwasong-17s were displayed, suggesting that the type has entered mass production, which makes further testing of the type unlikely (to my mind). Together with the Hwasong-17s, a new type of missile was sighted (see: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/9/north-korea-shows-off-possible-new-icbm-in-huge-military-parade). Prompting analysts to suspect that it might be a design for a solid-fuel ICBM - a major military goal that North Korea is striving for. Given that information, my bets for the next ICBM test that fits the criteria of the question would be that novel missile type. In the case of the Hwasong-17, it took about two years from firts ""presentation"" in a military parade (2020) to the first missile test (2022). Having no better heuristic, I'd suspect that the timeframe for the new - supposedly solid-fueled - ICBM might be the same. All that leads me to believe that ICBM tests with a range of 10,000km or greater are not very likely until September 2023."

North Korea has been very active in 2022, and to scale ICBM launch probability with general activity, any test launch NK conducts is modeled to initiate an ICBM launch in question with probability of 4/150.Judging by past data, NK has usually become less active the year after a very active year. We approximate three scenarios (rate of 10 missile tests next year, 20 tests and 80 tests) to have probabilities 40%, 40% and 20%, then the initial base rate for each option comes from exponential distribution considering these scenarios, taking also the 4/150 into account. In addition, if NK becomes more peaceful during this year, it is more likely they launch missiles early this year than late, so options 1 and 2 get an increase while option 4 is decreased."

Per CNN, the NK government made a big deal of the fact that they tested a new kind of missile showing photos of KJU at the launch. This missile can easily range the continental US. They have already tested multiple shorter-range missiles that could hit SK, Japan or Guam. The Hwasong-17 has the potential to divert the news and attention cycle back to NK where they want it. Testing another one in 2023 is a good way to ensure this happens. Given they tested at least one missile in each month of 2022 save for July, the likelihood they will test in January remains high. They opened last year with five tests in January alone.
