The trend of private companies squeezing out every last penny of profit from any given venture in the face of morality is a notable trend, and I doubt that a crisis like COVID-19 will stop them from pressuring member states of the WTO from voting only on agreeable (and profitable) terms for IPP waivers regarding COVID-19 vaccine technology. Though the WTO meeting on May 6 went ""well"" regarding the waivers, it is made clear that there are still no agreeable terms; just no outright rejections among member states. Thus, based on prior trends regarding profitability of private business headquartered within powerful WTO member states (like Moderna and Pfizer), I find it highly unlikely that a finalized proposal is produced and favorably voted upon by 3/4ths consensus within the next few months."

106361,2022-05-09T22:42:08Z,1,[73.0],[73.0],"Using Bayes, I had no probability last week so my Prior started with an estimate of 50%. There are 164 WTO members and 75% need to approve any TRIPS waiver which means 123 members must approve. Several articles indicate that there are over 100 members who currently back the proposal, which includes the US. Prior to last week, there were at least 29 countries (UK/Switzerland/EU) that dissented on this topic. Last week a draft document from the negotiation among the Quad members who previously dissented on the TRIPS waiver was released for all to review prior to the upcoming WTO meeting in June. A few issues still remain to be resolved though my estimate is that the fact that they released the draft assigns an 80% favorable probability that the TRIPS waiver will be passed with enough support of those mentioned and those not factored for. I think there is still a 30% chance that the dissenting countries will end up dissenting to stand in solidarity with core IP rules. By Bayesian statistics, I obtain a 73% probability that the TRIPS waiver will be granted by the WTO on the timeline indicated."
