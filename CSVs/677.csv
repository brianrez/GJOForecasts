I took a slightly different angle, looking at changes vs recent levels: If you look at the data since 1959, typically the next month is about the same as the prior three months housing starts with an 8% standard deviation around that. Given the recent levels (1.604 over last 3 months), as well as the consensus call for march housing at 1.62, that means there is a little more than a 50% chance of 1.6 million starts, but also very low chances of anything less than 1.2.

And the housing market across the U.S. has remained a heavy buyers market with low inventory in most places due to COVID.

Building permits, a strong indicator of new starts, in December 2020 were 17.3 percent higher than in Dec 2019. This all points to strong April new starts.

The conditions underpinning the housing market appear to be 3-fold - unemployment rate, mortgage rates, housing prices. Unemployment rate is approximately 8% range and by most indications should continue to lower in the next 6 months regardless of outcome of the election. This would provide wage support for housing purchases which should keep demand for housing high. Mortgage rates are at historic lows and the FED is projecting to maintain interest rates at or near zero into or through 2022. That would provide a low borrowing cost for home purchases and should maintain strong demand for purchases. A potential negative for the housing market is the near all-time high in median prices nationwide. Multiple factors seem to be contributing to continued demand driven price increases - stimulus payments keeping individuals out of major personal debt, desire to move into larger living arrangements in projection of continued remote working, and extremely lost cost of borrowing. However, there is a limit to the price affordability compared to the wages. If the housing prices reach that price point demand will plateau. One last consideration might serve as a brake on purchases - mortgage defaults. Current mortgage default rates are falling, however signs show this is being driven more by federal protection through forbearance programs which are due to expire in March 2021. Current housing starts are just over 1.4 million and I evaluate the combination of factors above should lead to slow and steady rise over the next six months."

Framing lumber prices are high and will depress activity. Good news, money is available; and people are looking to buy homes b/c they want a house and demographics favoring first time buyers. So demand will drive production. But overall this is a covid forecast. Probability of recurrence this winter - 100% infection rate - same as trend vaccine development and effectiveness - 80% chance one of the trial accines are approved by year end Vaccine deployment - 3rd quarter of 2021 enough vaccinated to return to normal. Government reponse of locking down - i do not belkeve gkvernors will do a broad lockdown again. No way to asskgn a probability.
