This makes sense as the country has been lifting mask and vaccine restrictions in recent weeks. At current 7-day average levels should easily hit the threshold before the deadline.

If its more like 5000 a day, then its just under so cases will have to stay flat and hold for the next month. there is still more BA.2 variant room to gain so this plateau could hold but I am leaning with @Emking that its not clear.

Excluding January data for 2022 gives a 99% chance of hitting the target. Including January reduces to 70%. With the new wave which as I understand is higher R0 (estimated around 12 vs Omicron's 9) and unknown virulence adds uncertainty so I am reluctant to keep a forecast in the 90s. Seeing the rolling 7 day average drop back below 2 million ( currently 2.116) would decrease the probability further.

Now there's two inside factors to consider: 1) March break bump given increased travel+testing necessity. That will certainly lead to two weeks of increased positive rates in my view. Secondarily, we're loosening more restrictions across Canada, particularly in population heavy Toronto, which could drive more infections. On the other hand, with reduced restrictions + less testing requiremnets (particularly travel on April 1) I think we'll see a rise in unreported cases which doesn't impact the case count for the purposes of this question. Also, entering ""warmer months"" in Canada may reduce spread as people are outside more."

There must be high acquired immunity from the Omicron wave, but BA.2 is already at ~20% and perhaps 30-40% more transmissible.

BA.2 is currently causing about 20% of all new cases (see https://outbreak.info/location-reports?loc=CAN ), and that percentage can be expected to increase. It's as contagious as measles and substantially antigenically different from Omicron, so it shouldn't be underestimated. The US is just behind Canada in the percentage of cases due to BA.2, and many locations are starting to see an uptick in SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater; cases in the US are likely to start rising soon. I think it's safe to expect that cases in Canada will likely start rising soon, as well.
