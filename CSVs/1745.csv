But the attack outside the Old City area shows that there are some IS fighters hidden in other parts of Mosul. How GJ will regard these small groups I am not sure. Presumably these hidden IS fighters could come out of hiding at any time in the next few weeks or months, so I assume GJ will consider Mosul ""liberated"" when Iraq says they have captured all the city even if odd outbreaks of fighting flare up later. It is still possible, but increasingly unlikely that the remaining 200 hundred IS fighters will surrender or be beaten by the end of June. 2 sq Km could take a while to clear one metre at a time."

The destroyed Mosque in very close the centre of the remaining area that IS control. Its destruction could be a sign that IS is almost finished (i.e. can only last a day or two) Its clear that now the end of IS in Mosul is close. Presumably the IS fighters that remain intend to be martyrs. It is not clear how many there are; estimates seem to suggest two or three hundred, but the estimates could be wrong. Its possible that some of martyrs are not as keen to die as others. Its possible that the last few could prefer to carry out a suicide attack, and so the battle will end quickly. It seems that IS still hold many thousands of hostages/human shields, at some point the IS fighters may be unable to keep control of them as they must be desperate not to killed by IS or in the cross fire (it is said many are in houses that have had their doors welded shut). So we have a situation where thousands of desperate people believe they and their families are at imminent risk of dying. Desperate people do unpredictable things. So this is long way of saying I have no idea when it will end, but it looks like days rather than months."

One problem is that much of this money is wasted. Billions are splurged on flashy gear like jet fighters or submarines that look impressive but may not be appropriate to the kinds of conflicts they are fighting. Such toys are also hard to maintain. And widespread theft and corruption mean that a lot of kit disappears, or is kept in the barracks (which is one reason why IS was able to nab so much in Iraq)."

There are even more problems getting civilians out than there were in Aleppo. A big difference is that the US and allies are involved in the attacks on Mosul, not the Russians. This means that the attacking forces have to take more care of collateral damage because (most of) the Western public will not be willing to support a massacre of civilians. This is slowing down the operations and I suspect will slow it down further. It is possible that the advance could be forced to halt. It is possible that IS will run out of ammunition, and/or food. https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/apr/13/photojournalism-on-the-frontline-an-inside-view-of-the-battle-for-mosul"

I am assuming the US and western allies will not want to be seen to be killing civilians, which will limit how much advantage having complete control of the sky will be. The US (and western allies) will not want to be seen to be supporting ground troops that might not respect the Geneva Convention. Its pretty clear that in the age of mobile phone videos and 24/7 news coverage, and the use of the internet to get propaganda messages shown, that the sort of illegal behavour that soldiers used to get away with in wars a few year ago will come back to haunt the reputation of the military. Winning faster control of Mosul at the cost of reputational loss will not make America Great Again. History tends to remember the massacres and slaughter of civilians; particularly history as told in places like the middle east. So if anyone is planning to get long term peace, they had better avoid a Shia or Kurd on Sunni war crime. I think the military is very well aware of this. So my guess is that they will move slowly and carefully. I accept that the situation in Aleppo was different, but only a little. From reports it seems the civilian population initially supported ISIS, before (so they say) changing their minds when they saw how ISIS treated them. I doubt that the locals can do much except to try and hide or get out. Those locals who joined ISIS probably realize that if they put down their arms now they are probably not going to be any more likely to survive than if they keep fighting. In other wars lynch mobs are not kind to their fellow citizens who have occupied their city. While it might be possible to stop war crimes by organized troops, civilian revenge will still take place. The option for ISIS of retreating to Raqqa is not very attractive; they have to get there; and once there they know that they could face Russian and Syrian aim power that will not be so picky about collateral damage, as well as US air power. The ISIS leader will probably do what leaders usually do, try to run and hide, while foot soldiers make a futile stand. Of course I could be completely wrong and it will be over next week."
