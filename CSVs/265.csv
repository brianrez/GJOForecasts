Given the conflict between the two nation states, supply disruptions, tight supply, and restricted export conditions (for varying reasons) persist. Restricted and taxed exports contribute to a worsening food security situation and a higher FPI. Given the empirical data and functional change in material conditions, we can expect a further change in FPI which will exceed the baseline in the IFP. Sanctions by the EU on imports from Russia over the last couple days have some but not a major impact on FPI and does not change the underlying assessment dramatically.

In case I'm wrong, I'm leaving a little weight on the 2 lowest bins. If it goes up as much in the next 6 months as it has in the previous 6, it will end up in the last bin, just barely. I'm leaving some substantial weight on bin 3 in case the increase slows a lot. As I wrote in a previous forecast, I do think prices will eventually fall again, but I don't see them falling in the forecast period because a variety of pandemic dislocations are still in play, and on top of that, many fertilizer prices are at an all-time high. I can't imagine yields that rely on fertilizer will be quite as high as previously, even if the weather cooperates."

So far, with all the issues the world inherited from the past 2 years, and the still lingering uncertainty regarding virus spread (still half of the world's population is unvaccinated, and over a billion are vaccinated with Sinovac, coronovac, which do not protect against omicron -- more disruption, shortages and delays are to be expected.

Fertilizer prices started rising last year, after it was relevant for the last crop. Farmers aren't going to use as much fertilizer this year because the prices are just too high. They're finding alternative sources, but it's hard to replace standard commercial fertilizer. With fertilizer prices continuing to rise, it seems likely to me that the food price index will likely continue to climb. The climb in fertilizer prices is starting to slow, but many key ingredients are at all-time highs. In addition, so many of the pandemic issues that drove up the food price index over the past 2 years are still unresolved. And now Omicron is sweeping the world, even as Delta isn't overwith, either. There are 6 months in this forecast. It would not be impossible for the index to end up in any bin. Last year, the index went up 16.7 points from Dec 2020 to June 2021. If it did the same this year, it would end up at 150.4, right on the edge between bins 4 and 5, so I'll focus my forecast there. As there is a lot of uncertainty, I will cast a wide net beneath bin 4, too."
