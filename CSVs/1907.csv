Mike Pence, seeking reelection after a controversial first term, has history on his side; Incumbent governors get reelected 72 percent of the time in America, according to the Center on the American Governor. In Indiana, no elected Republican governor has failed to win a second term. But the governor’s plans could be derailed by a force even more potent than his Democratic foes: a raft of headlines portraying Pence as out of step on social issues and hostile to women. “We've got the governor's race as a toss-up,” said Brian Howey, creator of the nonpartisan Howey Politics and a Statehouse media veteran. Former House Speaker John Gregg, who will be on the ballot alongside Pence May 3 as the Democratic governor nominee, narrowly lost to Pence four years ago. This time, he has attracted little public attention until recently, choosing to let the media spotlight stay on his adversary. “When he was running in 2012, there was no record of an incumbent,” said Robin Winston, an Indiana political strategist. “This time, [Gregg] will be running on a record of whether or not the present governor has stayed in touch with people on kitchen table issues.” http://www.ballstatedaily.com/article/2016/04/news-gregg-pence"
