But if anyone is to spring a surprise, it could be Iran. Prices have recovered to near $50 a barrel thanks to a lucky (for some) turn of events. Though Iran and Saudi Arabia failed to agree in April on a production freeze, supply disruptions since then in Iraq, Nigeria, Libya and elsewhere have in effect done their work for them; OPEC production is roughly flat at January levels despite Iran’s extra output. Logic suggests OPEC should let the rebalancing of the oil market continue at its own pace. But Iran, which is pumping at nearly full capacity, may yet confront Mr Falih by proposing a freeze. It said yesterday that it wouldn’t—but given the antagonism between the two Gulf powers, surprises can’t be ruled out"

Will move it down to 7% on following basis: - it still makes sense to agree to freeze/cap to more concretely floor prices - there is still time left in question, including an OPEC meeting in June - could Assad be a bargaining chip between Russia and Saudi Arabia?"

We know why Iran won't cooperate with KSA and that it isn't in Iran's immediate interest to actually cut production sooner than they hope. OTOH, they need to be seen as being fully integrated with the world economy and being recognized for their economic potential. It costs nothing to attend the meeting in Doha (planned) and nothing to announce that they will do something in the future to support stable oil prices. No clarification whether just an announcement for something in the future would be enough, but I suspect it would suffice. As a comparison class, OPEC decisions also have been notoriously leaky. YMMV"

At first I thought close to zero, but considering the possibility of weak caps, I'm coming in higher.
