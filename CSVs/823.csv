Trump getting the virus, then telling seniors it wasn't dangerous, and insistence on promising healthcare without providing any details are likely a few of the reasons his support is diminishing in the state. It's definitely not solid blue, but its gotten to the point where its nearly leaning Dem, which was almost unthinkable a few weeks ago. It will almost definitely be close, but Dems already have hundreds of thousands more mail-in ballots submitted than Reps and with just three weeks left until the election it's hard to justify not giving Biden the advantage here."

The republican rhetoric is proud of american ideals and the democratic rhetoric is weak, whinging, and critical. No matter how correct people may think democratic points are, the truth is that rhetoric is a stronger determiner of political outcomes. Today it as true as it was in Teddy Roosevelt's 1910 speech, it's not the critic who counts. However, the power of outrage peddlers cannot be overlooked.

I don’t trust the masses to wear masks and distance either, so the virus will in no way look like it’s under control in early November. We will likely still see double digit unemployment as well which won’t work well for the trump administration. If we don’t feel safe, we don’t spend money... we don’t travel, eat out, or even care about a new car when we can’t use it...or feel we can afford it once the stock markets get a grip on reality, and our 401k’s are taking the hit that’s likely coming. If we don’t have the money, we can’t spend it, and hiring back all of the recently unemployed is just not going to be something that happens soon enough for impatient Americans.
