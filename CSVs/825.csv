The government have previously said they have hoped the test can be done, but usually the recommendations given by assigned experts are followed. For those reasons I radically change my prediction to an almost certainty it will be canceled."

Another is that the worldwide situation continues to be horrific and a lot of people probably tend to continue respecting social distancing and avoiding going out when they have symtoms of Covid-19."

This is creating pressure for them to do more about the effects of COVID=19 on the country, specifically implementing measures that will reduce the mortality rate. Despite this, I don't believe they will cancel the SweSAT, especially since improving education remains a priority. On the other hand, because of this, I believe they will implement some sort of remote testing option or move the test online, as well as make testing more flexible somehow."

Additionally, this is the only time the test has been cancelled, and the cancellation is impacting 70k+ students. There doesn't seem to be much speculation regarding the test moving forward in the fall. Sweden has used a more open approach with COVID, as far as avoiding lockdown / closing the economy, there pattern of diagnosed cases each week has been quite consistent with around 400-700 new cases per day over the last few weeks [2]. It is unclear if that pattern will continue, or if immunity will build up, driving the infection rate down. In the worst case, Swedish infections will look as bad as they do now, so by fall there should be a good understanding of how to do events like this. Indeed, in the US the Fundamentals of Engineering exams are going forward with a set of rules for test takers [3].
