"In Tennessee Wine & Spirits Retailers Association v. Blair, will the Supreme Court rule that Tennessee's residency requirements for issuing liquor licenses are unconstitutional?",2018-12-07T18:00:54Z,2019-06-26T15:00:22Z,Yes,"['Yes', 'No']","['Society', 'US Policy']",178,654,104,237,"In February 2018, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed a district court's ruling that Tennessee's minimum residency requirements for retail or wholesale liquor license applicants violated the dormant Commerce Clause of the Constitution by discriminating against out-of-state individuals and entities (SCOTUSBlog). A Tennessee association of retailers appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the state's requirements are permissible under the Twenty-first Amendment, which repealed Prohibition (Oyez). The Supreme Court is expected to hand down its decision in its 2018 term, but if it does not, the question will resolve as no. Confused?

J. Alito, J. Kavanaugh, and J. Kagan's hypotheticals seemed to show that TN could put a 100-year residency requirement in place, and under the interpretation of the 21st Amendment brought by the Association, it would stand. J. Kavanaugh also seems uncomfortable broadening the original intent behind the 21st's language designed to let dry states stay dry. On the other hand, J. Gorsuch and J. Kagan pointed out that if they strike down the state's regulation, someone will likely come for the three-tiered system next. CJ Roberts might find a way to craft a narrow decision that lets the regulation stay in place without giving the states unlimited regulatory power. J. Thomas, based on his previous dissent, likely will not affirm the lower courts' rulings. If CJ Roberts can do that, then he'd have J. Thomas, himself, maybe J. Kagan and J. Gorsuch, and J. Breyer. But that would also overturn the previous rulings in Bacchus and Granholm that held the 21st Amendment did not allow states to violate the dormant Commerce Clause. Even at its highest overturning rate in 1950, 12% of the Court's cases overturned a prior decision. For the Roberts' Court, it has been between 1-7%. So ultimately, I think they will affirm the lower courts and find the requirements unconstitutional. Also, I'm going with a higher number because I think the probability is at least greater than 50%, so why not go all in? Note: I'm sure there are very good reasons not to go all in, which I will learn to my sorrow."

The 10-year residency requirement merely helps the residents of the state maintain a monopoly on the liquor trade and does little to benefit the public. There will likely be at least five votes against the residency requirement (Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagen and Roberts). The remaining justices may have a one or two yes votes (Gorsuch and Kavenagh) but Thomas and Alito will likely vote no. The states rights argument may prove persuasive with these justices."

You might get a court judgement on this but it won't protect the traders. I think the court, being 'conservative', will support the district court. The main counter-argument is that it will loosen alcohol sales in a state which has strict supply regulations but whether this comes under 21st Amendment is another question."

The other four Justices might find other reasons to support the Sixth Circuit, but this feels like a five/four issue to me. In this simplistic view of the issue, it takes a switch of only one of the five expected no votes to uphold the Sixth Circuit. There's your 20 percent."
