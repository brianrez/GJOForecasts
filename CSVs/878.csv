Virginia which seems to be on average for other states with the virus appears as if it will peak in late April (https://www.wric.com/health/coronavirus/virginias-peak-coronavirus-outbreak-prediction-moved-from-may-to-april/).

There are a decent amount of delegates on the table in Ohio on April 28th and in Georgia on May 19th. If he outperforms the predictions he will stay in until at least June 2nd when the next big round of Primaries is. He will see the writing on the wall no later than the New York Primary on June 23rd. I think it is unlikely he will withhold his endorsement of Biden until the Democratic Convention like he did in 2016 with Hillary due to party pressure.
