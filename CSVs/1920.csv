For decades the princes were locked into a system where divided multiple security forces (Defense, National Guard, Police, Border Guard etc,) each with a prince at the head balanced each other other out. It was like a game of Jenga; while no one changed anything it looks like a strong structure, but if anyone tries to remove one piece there is a high risk of the whole edifice collapsing. Any freedom given to any group (e.g. women allowed to drive) or or taken away (e.g. restrictions on what the religious police can do) will destabilize Saudi society because the conservatives will not be happy. In Saudi Arabia, as in medieval Europe everyone ""belongs"" to a ""sponsor"", that is someone who gives them access to power and or protects them from power, if princes who are near the top of the pyramid are removed, their ""people"" have no one to look after them. In a hierarchical society like Saudi Arabia that is very upsetting because new hierarchies are not easily formed. In any autocracy the most dangerous time is when reform is attempted because those who benefit from the status quo will resent losing privileges while those who should benefit from change have their hopes raised, but are disappointed when the befits seem not to the coming fast enough. So the listing of Saudi Aramco could be seen not as an opportunity to invest in a stable flow of oil, but a risky investment in an unstable country, in an unstable commodity that it past its peak."

While events such as a minor prince being found misbehaving (see link below) are were not unknown in the past, as were stories of Saudi women ignoring the dress rules, these usually only came to light well after the event and were dismissed as rumors. Until April 2016 the Mattawa (Religious Police) would have enforced the laws against alcohol and the laws on dress, but since then changed have been made, removing the right of the Mattawa to arrest people. As misbehaving is now being seen on social media I would expect more conservative Saudis would attribute at least part of the blame on the government (in effect the Royal Family) for being too modern. The Saudi state exists as a covenant between the Wahhabi religious establishment and the Saudi Royal Family, if the Royal Family is seen to be not backing the Wahhabi establishment enough, then the legitimacy of the Royal Family could be called into question. If that happens who knows what will happen next."

(a) They seem to be aiming for an IPO in 2018 (b) If the price of oil remains closer to $50 a barrel than $60 a barrel they might not be able to get the price they want (c) Matters could come to light that make potential investors unsure of what they would be buying. (d) Saudi Arabia may be more unstable that it appears to be. It is difficult to be sure how secure the position of the new Crown Prince is. It is known he likes to take decisive actions, but it is not clear if what he does is always wise. The Saudi society is very conservative and previous rulers (the Crown Price is the de facto ruler today) have been very careful not to make changes at a faster pace than society is ready to accept. The Saudi system (in common with many dictatorships) is based on having several different power bases below the King, none of which is quite powerful enough to seize control. These include religious and legal powers, as well as a number of well armed military and para-military forces that report to and are loyal to different ministers (who are also Princes and relatives of the King). Beside the forces of the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of the National Guard has what is effect a second and counterbalancing army, the Ministry of the Interior has another group of armed land and sea forces. Any changes in Saudi Arabia have to take into account the rights and privileges of each of these groups that in many ways act as states within the state. Each group is headed by people who have traditional two way loyalties to the King and rights over aspects of the running of the state. Any changes to the status quo are bound to unsettle this balance of power. It is well known that reforming authoritarian regimes creates great risks to stability - expectations often jump ahead of delivery for those wanting changes, and those fearing the changes will try and stop them. I am not trying to forecast what will happen to Saudi Arabia in the next few years , but an impetuous, inexperienced new de facto ruler could destabilize the country. This could be made worse by the end of oil money that has held the country together since the 1970s (before that the oil money was much lower). Although it seems that it is not always politic to acknowledge the fact, it is Saudi Arabia that has been where Al Queda and ISIS got a lot of its support, upset the fragile balance and it could turn into another failed Arab state."

The company plans to finish selecting banks later this year ahead of a listing in the second or third quarter of 2018, two of the people said. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Michael Klein, the former Citigroup Inc. investment banker who runs his own advisory firm, have already been selected to work on the IPO, people familiar with the matter said in April. Klein is providing strategic advice to the government, while JPMorgan is working on preparations for the IPO and may be among the banks that underwrite the listing, the people said.

Saudi Arabia is facing financial problems - these problems may reduce somewhat as oil price has crossed $50/barrel and has stayed there for some months now. This reduces the pressure on the kingdom to diversify. 2. There is a prospect that oil prices could go up further in 2017 - as investment in upstream has reduced during 2015 (25%) & 2016 (24%) and may fall during 2017 as well - while oil demand has risen by 1.8 million bpd and 1.2 million bpd in 2015 & 2016 and is expected to go up another 1.2 million bpd in 2017 (IEA). This should reduce the pressure on monarchy to list Aramco. 3. For a listing, Aramco will have to do roadshows in major financial centres in US and Europe where they will have to speak to investors and the media. The monarchy can face serious embarrassment at the hands of pro-democracy activists/journalists in such a setting - where they can be asked questions about freedom of religion in KSA, status of women, support to ISIS or the war in Yemen. Will the monarchy/country want to provide a forum where it can be questioned? Without some radical reforms which allows the kingdom to show a reformist face to the world, scrutiny by media can result in a major loss of face. 4. Aramco will also need to make public a lot of financial and operational information - including information about the state of their oil fields - which they have so far hidden. These are difficult issues to resolve and will take time. It also needs to be decided on what information can/cannot be made public. 5. Media reports indicate that the divestment in Aramco and the diversification of Saudi economy away from oil are initiatives of the Deputy Crown Prince, who is also in charge of the war in Yemen. This intervention has been going on since March 2015 (21 months now) - and seems likely to stretch. This reduces the credibility of the Deputy Crown Prince to carry out radical steps."

The fact that they maintain high production to get as much cash as they can under the low prices, while relinquishing their role as price regulator, could also suggest a different agenda. The IPO might be an option, but one that they will use only when other solutions have not worked.

Going through everyone's articles that were posted it seems like the Saudis want an IPO ""by"" 2018, that means in 2017 they'll plan on doing the work (@amystoller thanks for the timeline for an IPO but I do wonder if it applies to an IPO on the Saudi Market). I'd like to know what the timeline is for an IPO on the Saudi Market. I'll look for that but from all the articles, it seems like the Saudis want this.

The Saudi Aramco chairman has not been definitively quoted as confirming this. Is it the parent company the Prince was even talking about or perhaps some of the downstream JVs? Wouldn't it be easier to create more JVs direct with International Oil Companies rather than satisfy the massive exchange rules and regulations in somewhere like NY or London. With 1.5 years left to run it must be less than 50% initial rate based on January's news releases but cannot be zero. 25%.

Saudi is moving full steam ahead to raise it's market share with no holds. Oil prices staying up is definitely helping their case. I would say this is exactly how any company will move ahead of a likely IPO. The big question is what valuation the company can get. They are aiming quite high. I have come across estimates as high as $2tn! Crazy! Though the spread and the range of numbers being talked about is quite wide. Some are even talking about as low as $500bn. Whichever way it is, this is a very high likelihood. Given the long timeline, I think this happens. Reiterating my initial forecast, and I see no reason to move it either way at this point."

It's a huge step for Saudi Arabia and they expect big financial returns from putting only 5% of the company on the market. But their large scale projects always move slowly and there may be corrupt skeletons in the closet. Also the Ghawar field is probably spoiled by pressure pumping too much sea water. I can see the Aramco IPO being postponed indefinitely. On the other hand I don't think the other Saudi Royals want Mohammed bin Salman to lose face. The matter of strengthening and modernizing their country requires action and the momentum for the IPO is there now, and that's sooner than you think.
