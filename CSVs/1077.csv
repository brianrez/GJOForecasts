All indicators that I'm seeing point toward a challenge for the GOP to hold on to their two seat majority, particularly given that 6 out of 7 battleground states (apparently) are Republican held at the moment. (I can't help noticing this is the opposite of the situation Democrats faced in the US Senate last year.) The GOP do have a strong track record in Virginia for several decades--I'm weak on that knowledge, but that's my vague idea--but that seems to be turning the other way, with demographic changes. Of course that's largely in Northern Virginia, and the vote in the rural Senate districts may still reflect that more traditional, White Southern demographic, giving them an edge in those seats. But the swing districts are mostly in the more urbanized areas of greater Richmond, as well as Virginia Beach, and suburban DC. There's time for Republican surge in popularity and energy--maybe partly as a backlash against the impeachment? But we're getting close now too--November 5. So yeah, I'm going to tweak a bit more in the Dems' favor."
