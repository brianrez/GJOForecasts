Total SGTF cases now at 124,954, after adding over 25k today, so with these 'probable' cases it would be game over already. As an indicator, SGTF cases were at 62.85% Omicron on 15th, climbing at approx 5% per day. Even if the sequencing rate drops to an average 10k per day (in total), then at anything over 70% prevalence for Omicron should clear 100k around 28-29th December. This is without any 'probable' cases. I think there will undoubtedly be a few days with lower counts due to staff shortages through holidays and illness, but while only 4 lighthouse labs test for SGTF, sequencing is carried out through a large network comprised of NHS organisations, the four Public Health Agencies of the UK, the Wellcome Sanger Institute and twelve academic partners, which should help average out daily capacity to some degree. It is perhaps not an absolute certainty at this point, but we should be 4-9k ahead of the doubtful range imho for 22nd December, so I'll hold and monitor for now."

How SGTF testing is only used in four lighthouse laboratories around the UK and therefore is not reliable for providing a geographic representation of Omicron due to regional dead spots, but still very valuable to gauge the speed of spread and prevalence. UKHSA now list confirmed cases (via whole-genome sequencing or genotyping) and SGTF cases, on their daily overview: cumulative data, but while SGTF is not included in that total confirmed and probable set (yet), they do list SGTF as 'probable' cases via the Daily Briefing report Summary... curious. Anyway, I was going to comment on that, then I saw that over 10k cases have just been reported as confirmed in a single day. 10,059 for a total of 24,968. So sequencing capacity appears to have increased, compared to previous weekly high of 64k. SGTF cases were at 62.85% on 15th, climbing from 56.91% on 14th. These indicators suggest the total will exceed 100k within 12 days, even with a drop in sequencing over holiday periods."

They may not use their usual genotyping assay at all. If they start reporting SGTF/69-70 deletion samples (now considered probable cases) in the data used to resolve this question, it will resolve next week. If they only report sequences, then it is trickier. Perhaps we can expect ~70% of sequenced samples in the data reported Dec 24 to be Omicron. Let's say 65k sequences * 0.7 = 45k Omicron. 45k + 10k = 55k. Nearly all sequences in the final report of the year will be Omicron. But how much will they sequence that week?

Also significant is that the total number sequenced (and genotyped!) this week was over 111,000. So this rate has increased and will reflect in higher total numbers of Omicron as it gains prevalence. For example if Omicron reaches 50% prevalence by 28th December, the total number of sequenced and genotyped results for that week could now be >55k. So the cumulative total could well be 10-20% higher than based on my earlier estimate for sequencing capacity. To counter that, Delta cases are also rising, and continued prevalence of Delta will hold the proportion of sequenced Omicron cases back till Omicron gains dominance.

But more likely I think will be a marginal decrease in the doubling rate as Plan B gets pushed ahead (partly to cover up headlines on the Government’s Christmas parties last year - during lockdown). So I’m expecting Omicron at ~35% prevalence by year end, and a total of 45-60k sequenced results.

I believe people may do less testing over Xmas period, so likely to be less to sequenced, leading to less confirmed cases. But might see a big jump in Jan. iIt looks like about 1.6m cases can get sequenced in a week and Delta is about 1.4m of these. Omicron has to therefore become about 2pc of overall sequenced cases to get to 30k per week. This feels like it could happen quite quickly, but maybe not quickly enough for end Dec.

Still making bin1 very unlikely. What’s changed since the Delta wave is that genomic sequencing capacity and speed has increased, so the gap between sequenced cases and reported cases could be much smaller than we saw previously. I also suspect that S-gene target failure (SGTF) will increasingly be used as a more widespread method of detection, due to convenience, concerns about R and tracking community spread with minimal delays. Further mitigating factors are not likely in the very short term, at least in England, so I'm still estimating a doubling rate ~4-6 days (from ~3 currently). All leads me to believe we may hit 100k ‘confirmed or probable’ cases through genomic sequencing a week or two earlier than initially projected, making bin2 overwhelmingly likely.

With that in mind, as well as the currently high number of daily cases that is expected to remain high (and most likely, increase), it's only a matter of time until most (trending towards all) daily cases are Omicron cases. How long this takes will depend on how dominant Omicron is against Delta. For reference, Delta became dominant in less than two months and is considered ~1.5 times more likely to cause an infection compared to Alpha in the UK (https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/public-health-now/news/delta-variant-60-percent-more-contagious-original-virus-and-evades-immunity). If this were to hold for Omicron vs Delta then it seems very likely that 100k cases (*confirmed or probable*) could be reached by the end of January. In particular, Delta appeared during spring, a period that included some restrictions, more outdoor activities and vaccines, as opposed to winter, which as we saw last year can accommodate many cases even if there are restrictions (although there were no vaccines last winter). If Omicron is not dominant over Delta e.g., if it is equally likely to cause an infection, then it could take a moderate amount of time to reach 100k cases (*confirmed or probable*) because Delta will remain the most probable source of infection for some time. If Delta remains the dominant variant then Omicron could disappear quite quickly, or at least occur very rarely in the confirmed or probable cases, as other variants of concern did in France for example once Delta became dominant. Because of the preliminary evidence indicating Omicron might spread much more than Delta, my initial outcome distribution is going to tend towards the end of January. https://twitter.com/TWenseleers/status/1465100337631608832 https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1466480113487392769"
