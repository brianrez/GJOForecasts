The US has often threatened to cut that support but so far hasn't, despite many bumps in the road. Accepting the Yuan would reduce the Dollar's role as the focal point of the international monetary system. America doesn't care if dictators dictate but hit their bottom line, especially the system itself in such a big way and they will definitely care more. The Saudis don't want to rock the boat at this point, especially with the Chinese economy going through a rough patch. The pressure on the Chinese to stop undervaluing their currency might also lead to a lot of fluctuations of the value of the currency, albeit most likely being a good ROI for the Saudis."

108192,2022-11-11T18:09:20Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"Confidence in the United States has been steadily eroding globally. If we look at the history of failed democracies, which can be measured by confidence in their democracies, capitalism and free markets by themselves are not enough to stabilize them. Markets rely on confidence. Democracies encourage confidence, but the health of the democracy is a better indicator. UK parliament was a good example of how currency can plummet due to lack of faith and confidence in a country's democracy. The United States is struggling with a similar condition, among many other challenges it currently faces. We see that the bank of Israel is changing its policy to diversify its currency holdings, reducing US dollar holdings from roughly 66% to 61%. Still, they are proceeding cautiously with adopting the Yuan. The Yuan is traditionally a volatile holding for the west. It has to be treated very differently. Bloomberg reported that US dollars held in foreign exchange have fallen to their lowest percentage since 1995. I believe confidence globally in the United States is lower irrespective of party. The world does not expect enough positive results and successful navigation from the United States internally, democratically speaking, as a country, to deliver it the solidarity and unity it believes is necessary to hold confidence in its currency the way the United States would like. However, I believe other countries are being a bit overly pessimistic and premature. We continue to defy the odds in many respects and are a dynamic nation, not just a democratic one, and therefore more adaptable. However, with our democracy struggling, that makes us less adaptable, so factors may cancel each other out. It is not necessarily disadvantageous for the United States or those who hold our dollars to diversify. A collective strategy can be beneficial economically, especially given the current global political climate and competing factors. I am skeptical that Saudi Arabia would accept the Yuan on more than a marginal basis for oil. The yuan is too volatile. The instability that would introduce for Saudi Arabia seems unusual to me for the Saudis to entertain. However, China has become the biggest importer of oil. For this to have less effect on the United States and other economies, where currency is concerned, oil's importance would need to be severely diminished as a basis for economy and currency. This raises an important question: if the dollar is no longer based on gold, and we transition away from its base on oil, what will it be based on? Being at a transition point economically with climate change underway, China's quest for economic dominance and control of world markets and business is challenging. Riyadh has less and less oil purchases from Beijing as pressure. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia has been moving forward with diversification in investments and green energy. Saudi Arabia is wealthy enough to hold out. Saudi Arabia is a king maker, more than it is beholden. For its own interest, I could see Saudi Arabia making some concessions, for diplomacy, but not giving China everything it wants. They are likely to think more globally and internationally than China is, at this point. However, I do see that China and Saudi Arabia have a lot in common, maybe more so than the west, and that the United States has made huge political mistakes where adopting a sustainable economy that is seated in diversified alternative energy and economy for the future is concerned. We aren't poised to compete, as a result, in the way other nations, including Saudi Arabia, would like, regarding leadership. Our industry and politics are old, compared to what's being demanded and discussed internationally. In my opinion. I place the probability of Saudi Arabia accepting the yuan before Christmas as very low, but I estimate a much higher probability of it taking place next year as the new market quarters proceed."
