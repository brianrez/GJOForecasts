We saw similar jump in concern and steps in self-isolation in mid March with full shut downs starting on March 22nd. Given that we have more information about the decease and increasingly ways to treat it, i would expect that the number of infected cases to peak somewhere between April 15th and 22nd. Since everyone will be looking to get back to normality as soon as possible and we should have testing methods to see if any of the players are sick we should be able to get back to games by mid-May (even if without audiences).
