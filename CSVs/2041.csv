Obviously they want a settlement that is as close to ""one and done"" as possible (i.e. they pay off the Federal and State governments and hopefully have money left over to reimburse car owners and then are left fighting calls action suits.....but only from the car owners that don't accept VW's settlement), and they also want to avoid criminal charges (just as the banks paid their tens of billions in protection money but avoided criminal charges). By all accounts a deal was close, but VW was still dragging its feet. Now it has ""leaked"" that VW's CEO was involved in email chains about the fraudulent activity in 2014. This happens for a reason. There is a risk that a criminal charge will be filed as leverage or that VW will have to accept both some criminal charges and a civil settlement (VW's leverage is to say they will not pay any restitution until the criminal matters are resolved). I still think it is unlikely that the criminal investigation is far enough along by 30 March to have charges filed that soon, but if the purpose is ""leverage"" then the charges could come sooner rather than later."

First, little information has been published recently that would indicate a high likelihood for DOJ charges against Volkswagen in the next month. Applying N (norms and protocols matter) from CHAMPS KNOW, the DOJ would first subpoena information that would allow them to build a case in the courts against Volkswagen. After this months long process occurred, the DOJ can then file charges. Historically, the DOJ does not rush through the process of opening cases, and often takes months to do so once information is subpoenaed. There is no reason to believe this norm would change, and since information has not yet been subpoenaed (with only one month to go before this question expires), it seems more likely that criminal charges won’t arise until the latter part of 2016 or early 2017."

While this trip is nominally centered on the TTIP, it's likely important issues relating to the VW incident will be discussed. The DOJ is, with the exception of what I'll call the ""special protection unit,"" under Obama's control. VW would not be criminally indicted without the knowledge and approval of Obama. VW is such an important firm in Germany that it would be a bit shocking for Obama, through the DOJ, to indict VW criminally immediately prior to his trip. I've still heard nothing as to the expected actions of the German prosecutors, but as to this question, I think that if there is a criminal indictment of VW coming, it would make the most political sense for Obama to postpone it until asfter the April trip. Alternatively, the laying of a criminal indictment prior to the trip might be a way for Obama to demonstrate some ability to exercise power over Germany. A problem with this latter strategy is that once such power has been exercised, any leverage it generated is gone. Short answer, Obama trip in April makes this less likely before then.

This would provoke a major scandal in Germany, and prevent the executives to visit USA for negotiations! The Germans are quite upset with the civil law suit already, since USA, being ca. 4% of world population are using ca. 45% of world energy resources annually, did not sign the Kyoto protocol. Therefore, though the German public does not approve VW's cheating, the impression arises that other motivation is driving the potential fine of 90 Billion US$ than environmental concerns. If the US will file criminal charges, that would mean that German chief executives would have to be extradited to US, and bring a real test to the transatlantic relationship - US administration should not test the strained relationship at this time. There is a lot of bad feelings in Europe already in regards to the US's Ukrainian and Middle East politics, and this one could bring a complete revision of the EU partnership to USA, and the EU's union it self. The logical prediction should be 0%. However, the quality of many US governmental decisions seem often to be bar any logic, which makes it difficult to predict."

Keep in mind that one of the purposes of the filing of the civil suit prior to any criminal indictments may be to allow discovery to occur which may render any planned criminal investigations/prosecutions to proceed with a higher likelihood of a successful outcome. Also note that a civil suit has a lower bar of evidentiary requirements for successful prosecution and this would be expected to be a realistic first response. Still unlikely to resolve within this short timeframe.

I'm mentioning this because the way I see this going down, from a criminal standpoint, is that the DOJ will let the German authorities take care of the individual criminal matters, and will seek to go after the corporation in the U.S.; but, will not seek to break the company, so would pursue a more lenient approach of deferred prosecution agreement or, lacking that, a plea deal."

It's an interesting problem with so many participants. The ""witnesses"" go free; at least in terms of the U.S. There's not a prosecutor in America who even knows the case law and statutes as to connivance (knowledge of, and tacit consent or indifference to, the improper conduct of another); let alone ever having charged anyone under them. (Not to suggest that this *should* be the case. And, as usual, I overstate to make a point; for surely there must be some.) It will be interesting to see what happens to the rest. In addition, will the DOJ pursue the ‘Responsible Corporate Officer’ (RCO) doctrine which is, according to the lawyers at the linked website, relevant to ""certain offences concerned with public welfare (such as those relating to environmental protection and food safety)"" and ""imposes criminal liability on officers who, because of their position in the corporation, had the responsibility and authority to prevent or correct infringements of the law.""

Though their topics are very different, their scales are similar, and eight months from 9/15 falls in 5/16, past the scope of this question.

An analogous example could be BP's DeepWater Horizon, which saw a criminal prosecution by the DOJ in a 6-month time period. As noted below, following the 2008-09 financial crisis, prosecution of banks took several years.
