Earlier this month, Tesla expanded its warranty to cover defective main computers in some Model S and Model X computers that led to touch screen blackouts, among other problems. > Consumer Reports said Nov. 19 in its annual Auto Reliability Survey that it‚Äôs no longer recommending the Tesla Model S due to issues with its air suspension, main computer and touch controls. It also panned the Model Y‚Äôs body hardware and paint problems and ultimately gave three of four Tesla vehicles subpar reliability ratings, including the Model S, Model X and Model Y."

Moreover, it hit a low of $408 today after dropping over 15% at one point, meaning it was very close to dropping below the $400 mark. While daily fluctuations do not mean much in the longterm, the fact that one can be so extreme is cause for concern. More importantly, however, the tech boom that reinvigorated the market months ago is beginning to cool and Tesla's current P/E ratio is over 1100, which is insane. This essentially means that the yearly earnings available to shareholders are more than 1000 times lower than the price of each stock. Most savvy investors look for stocks with P/E ratios closer to 10-15 and avoid those over 25. Name recognition and its past performance could keep the price up for a while, but its likely to come crashing down sooner or later. In reality, Tesla hasn't turned a profit in any of the last 4 fiscal years, so its current investors are really banking on the future. If the market crashes, however, I think Tesla falls hard and fast."

Financials are weak and fixed capital investment is costly, but will not become an issue. Tesla could easily raise new equity through different channels, when hostile takeovers may become interesting in the industry. Similar to Apple earlier, Tesla understands to engage the media for its purposes and has hardly any cost for marketing and nevertheless much attention in the news. Its premium only-strategy seems to work out: product pricing is still in the upper range on average, still the product appears desirable to customers. Electrification, digitalisation and expansion of mobile communications into every aspect of everyday life promises lots of opportunities for secondary businesses. It is, due to past squeezes in Tesla stock, at present more of a risk NOT to be invested in Tesla for large and institutional investors, which lays a floor at, say, 300USD. Possible news concerning a proprietary crypto currency for internal accounting would make sense to me in the near term, which could further justify valuation (which is not justified at the moment but a big bet on 2025 or later). Possible regulatory issues and actions with governments (especially in Europe) is the largest downside risk, but so far Tesla has been treated very benevolent. Moreover, Teslas success seems to be of special interest and under protection of the US government."

GM has a cap of $50B & $35 and has partnered to create their first battery plant. Ford cap is $35B & shares at $9 and has no battery plan. Forecasting past a Presidential election cycle is a fools game - but I'll play. The Shanghai factory should greatly improve profitability in 2020 which is what the current price must be based on.
