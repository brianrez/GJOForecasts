Net revenue has increased exponentially and without exception since the beginning of 2020, and 2021 saw the greatest annual proportional increase in sales in the company's history [1]. Due to COVID-19, and by virtue of the company being an online service, it can be expected for these sales numbers to only continue to improve as COVID-related restrictions persist under the new administration. Paired with penetration growth of 387%, I suspect that Libre's stock value will continue to rise with time, but not passing the $2,200 mark[2]."

However, it is still up 5.3% for the month and 44.74% for the past 3 months. Expecting a modest improvement over current prices in light of unusually high market volatility. A 10% gain from today's price ($1779.51) would still raise the value to $1957.46, close to the seam between the two mid-range options. Therefore, the preponderance of probability lies within this range. Again, considering volatility and a muted outlook for the continuation/resurgence of a rally this quarter, favoring the more conservative option."

Analysts appear to think the stock will continue to be strong in 2021 which should help it hold the astronomical growth it saw in 2020. The company is likely to report its Q4 earnings the first week of Feb. A strong number should send the stock higher in the short-term but its unlikely reach the 2,000 mark. Although it has spiked a few times, it has seemed to settle into the 1550-1650 range for the short-term."

Although the ecommerce market in South America looks promising I doubt last years rise in stock price would have been possible without the Covid-19 ecommerce boost and a global rise in stock markets due to low interest rates. Both effect are unlikely to produce a similar boost this period. Given the short time window I expect the stock price to hover around 1600. Slight change for it to rise above 1800. Small change it will rise above 2000 but due to high volatility not completely excluded.
