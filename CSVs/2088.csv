With a large amount of non-OPEC, US, China and Russian production at the marginal end of the cost curve, OPEC will struggle to martial the cost curve until this production disappears. Saudi Arabia just needs to keep pumping until this production closes down, and they can maintain prices with the marginal OPEC producers - Venezuela, Nigeria, Iran etc. There's too much of an incentive for many oil producers to just keep pumping at the moment - whether they're appeasing populations, trying to stop economies spiralling out of control or funding warfare. https://alphaglider.com/blog/2015/01/14/oil-antibiotics/ http://www.advisorperspectives.com/articles/2015/03/17/mlps-will-weather-the-storm"

Global oil production will overwhelm demand for another year or two. Much of it comes from sources that are beyond OPEC control. The essence of this question was whether desperate OPEC members like Venezuela could force a Saudi production cut to achieve a reduction in the OPEC production quota. The Saudis will not budge (see my comment of Oct 23). Since no other OPEC country is willing to cut production, the cartel now stands in ruins. The argument and the essence of the question was never about whether to increase the OPEC production. Given the current supply/demand context, that would be nonsensical. Failure to maintain or reduce the production quota, is simply failure. When a cartel cannot reach an effective agreement to limit production and control prices, it is no longer a functioning entity. Sifting through the wreckage misses this reality. OPEC no longer has the capacity to change any production quota. That's just gone."

As for whether there has actually been a change in the output target, well....we may need clarification from OPEC as to what its indecision means. OPEC does not have any motive to clarify its position, though, since it doesn't intend to change the actual production numbers, and the output target is just academic to them."

So, even barring a technical adjustment of the 30mm bpd ceiling, it seems almost certain that there would be some minor modification of country specific quotas (especially considering that Iran may deviate some 400k between the lower & upper bounds of expected production). Add to this, the recent announcement of investments by Saudi Aramco to upgrade Indonesia's largest refinery (http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/26/saudi-aramco-indonesia-pertamina-idUSL3N13L42X20151126#uRy4UCM2tJgwEIxD.97) suggests to me that some modification of country specific quotas are in the cards."

However they suspended from 1 Jan 2009 so a reinstatement could also be from 1 Jan, which would be on the question date. But the question is specific to before 1 Jan so I think unlikely in this time frame. Fracking in the US is now suffering and OPEC may want to keep that pressure up. While Iranian oil is now flowing there is little to be gained from changing quotas as the net effect will be minimal. Though some Gulf states could use the money to balance their books if they could get it, though with reserves far from an immediate problem. Hence I think that they will sit still for the moment, until a point comes where they could make an effective strategic move. I think at the moment OPECs focus will be on rebuilding cartel strength with a view to future positioning. That all said these are just initial thoughts, without research. I am forecasting 5% purely because there could be some inter country movement, but if the question included 1 Jan (which it clearly does not) I would be more like 90% due to Indonesia [subject to it being on the Dec Agenda]."

Furthermore, the rest of OPEC often follows the whims of Saudi Arabia since it is the largest oil producer in OPEC. Lastly, the success of both fracking and recovery from oil sands in the U. S. and Canada poses an existential crisis for OPEC. The U. S. is one of OPECs best customers and an increase in the price of oil will only aid further development of the domestic oil industry thereby reducing American reliance on OPEC.

The Saudis need to buy domestic tranquility with public spending. They have burned through $80 billion in foreign reserves this past year to do that. They would actually need $100 oil to balance their books on a current basis. So for the moment, Saudi Arabia's best choice is not to give up market share by cutting its own production.

SA and Iran are political adversaries so SA may would be reluctant to help Iran by changing quotas. But OPEC overall can keep the US producers starving both by maintaining current levels or by increasing them. The best short term action for SA is to maintain current OPEC production level unless and until the US changes its export law. With this Congress, there is little chance the export law changes by 1 Jan 2016. Other OPEC members will cheat on their quotas, as they always have, and SA will look the other way, as it always has.

Fuel subsidies and tax reforms will likely be among the first issues tackled by some within the GCC, as early as 2016 if oil prices remain low (i.e., Saudi output is increasingly being directed to its domestic market rather than to foreign consumers). Iran may very well prove to be a model of some of these changes, implementing a fixed cash payment system to help manage society's frustration with shrinking subsidies.

No: Iran is probably chomping at the bit to gather market share, Venezuela doesn't have enough sway in OPEC (as we saw last year) to change the production quota, and Saudi Arabia still seems very confident in its ability to survive for even a long period of time on low prices (http://www.bbc.com/news/business-34168659). They have opened up their markets to more investment and are cutting public works projects to balance the budget, but not even considering lower quotas."

The last (scheduled) OPEC meeting before the January deadline will be held in December. Under normal conditions, this would be a question of supply and demand. Supply far exceeds demand; as it did when the Saudis elected to keep the quota unchanged in 2015. What, if anything, has changed? -The US continues to bolster production and pursue alternative energy sources, despite OPEC's driving prices through the floor. -In the US, one of OPECS largest/most loyal customers is the US. 2016 is an election year. Reduced dependence on foreign crude will remain a hot-button, as it provides fodder for stump speeches. Americans are particularly responsive to tough talk; and in a field crowded with candidates, with no clear front-runner, the fourth quarter 2015 will be a time for stumping and much podium pounding. A spike in per barrel prices will inflame the drive for US oil production to stay in business, despite profit drains. Therefore, it is in the interest of all OPEC member countries to keep prices low; i.e, at or near quota."
