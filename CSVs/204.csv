For ""at least 330,000"" vehicles to be produced in 2022Q2, output needs to increase by 24,593, or approximately 8.05%. With production at Gigafactory Berlin having begun in March 2022, and Gigafactory Texas delivering finished vehicles in April 2022, this may be achievable. Both plants produce Tesla Model Y vehicles, and their production numbers are not included in the 2022Q1 10-Q report available on the Tesla Investor Relations website. If production at the Fremont, CA factory can be increased for the series of vehicles it produces, even slightly, along with steady production from the Berlin and Texas Gigafactories, this is achievable.The operation status of the Shanghai Gigafactory is not factored in with the analysis. If it is producing vehicles, then that will only help increase the likelihood of Tesla meeting the ""goal"" of this forecasting question."

With link to WSJ article: https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1515342044222349319 So, it looks like the factory will likely be operating during 1 shift for most of the rest of the month. It's not completely clear to me how many shifts it ordinarily has, but if it has 4, then each day at 1/4 capacity would result in a loss of production of ~1814 vehicles. So, as I wrote yesterday, it looks like for April, Tesla Giga Shanghai will have at least 17 closed days, resulting in a loss of ~41.1k vehicles, plus a loss of ~1.81k(?) for every day it remains at 1 shift, and ~1.2k(?) for every day at 2 shifts. If it is only open 1 shift per day for 10 days, that would potentially mean a loss of production of ~41.1k + ~18.1k = ~59.2k vehicles. And then there would be some days with only 2 shifts operating. And this all seems a bit optimistic. Even if Tesla could ordinarily have reached 380k in Q1 without Shanghai Covid lockdowns, which is beyond the most optimistic numbers I saw before the Covid situation in Shanghai came up, it wouldn't be able to make 330k now."

Giga has already been closed 8 days. It's extremely hard to see how it won't be closed at least 5 more days in Q2, and possibly many more beyond that. Far smaller outbreaks in other cities have led to weeks of lockdowns. Moreover, Shanghai's outbreak tests the limits of China's zero Covid policy, which has been showcased by the regime as a successful strategy. A lot is at stake here, from people's health to the Chinese and world economy to a central policy and point of pride of the regime.

This range would be well above 330 (c350-400). On the basis of production 1 year ago rather than sequential quarters Tesla growth is consistent at 60-70% (2Q 20 was 206 and the range gives 330-350). In terms of capacity there is a shut down in Shanghai which will reduce production, which to an extent will be offset by new Berlin deliveries. (say 30k for both although with more downside than upside). I am going for a high probability with an intent to adjust down if the Shangahi lockdown lasts into the second half of April."

Credit to @belikewater for the delivery forecast link, I feel like I actually have a well-informed outside rate now, the Q2 forecast there with the historic -3% accounted for would be ~322k. Each day of lockdown in Shanghai cuts ~2k vehicles, and the Jilin lockdown was multiple weeks long. The outside rate on this was already sub-50% (unless posting realistically but not exaggeratedly low production forecasts is an elaborate April fools joke), so lockdowns bring that down lower. That said, I'm not sure if Shanghai lockdowns are being priced into the forecast numbers already. Will need to keep watching this one. Also, Tesla forecasted >50% growth in 2022, if that applies quarter-by-quarter then 50% over Q22021 would be ~309k, then there's some small bump above that for the >, so the numbers here at least seem internally consistent."

I'm moving my forecast down a little lower because of the Shanghai lockdowns, which have been expanded. It's hard to see how lockdowns won't also be extended with increasing local cases. One projection I've seen is for ~369k vehicles produced in Q2; this estimate is from someone whose recent quarterly estimates have been off by only -3.1% to -2.6%. (If his Q2 estimate is off by -3.1%, the actual value would be 380k.) If all else goes well elsewhere, and if this projection would otherwise be true, then there's about 39k wiggle room on this forecast. As I understand it, Tesla operates its Shanghai factory 24/7 and makes ""over 50k"" vehicles/month (and growing). So it could withstand approximately 24 days of shutdown and still make it to 330k. I could picture 24 days of lockdowns closing the Shanghai factory, though. Other provinces, e.g., Jilin, have been locked down until it's been 14 days since the last case has been detected, but that rule may not be adhered to in Shanghai. I've also heard rumors about Tesla workers living in company housing on site or taking company buses and that production could continue that way, too. Some financial traders working for banks are being asked to live at work during the lockdowns. So, I'm keeping my forecast relatively high for now, but watching and waiting. I agree with @Eolienne that the situation in Shanghai could potentially have a big impact on this question."

Of course, shortages in key ingredients have hampered production at other automakers this past year, however has been largely spared by keeping a big inventory of parts. With sustained problems, these problems could grow. However, given the output of the last few quarters and sustaining the current growth trend, these numbers are very much achievable. New car demand is on the return and new offers are being happily picked up by consumers right now, this doesn't immediately concern this question but gives a good rationale for meeting targets in the second quarter if that can be facilitated."
