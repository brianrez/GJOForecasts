In addition, they are a N.A.T.O. ally which means any major foreign invaders invokes the wrath of the rest of the alliance. While Erdoğan himself also seems like a prime candidate for dictatorial actions and Turkey has a history of racial violence (I.e. Armenians and Kurds), it seems highly unlikely this will occur in the country's current state."
