The threat of his arrest was probably at its zenith in February and threatened by Maduro. Due to a lack of action , this popularity has been waning with his acceptance by the public of his presidency going form 49% in February to 36% in June. Since April Maduro and the Supreme court have accused the opposition of treason and conspiracy without retaliation from the International community. This may have given Maduro some respite from Gusaido, the figure head of the opposition. The onset of Covid-19 has come into play by getting Maduro and Gusaido to come together in a joint effort to raise funds to fight the pandemic, given the IMF’s refusal to offer funds to combat the virus due to a lack of clarity as to who is the recognised president. The presidency standoff has therefore had to be stalled to combat the pandemic. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/02/venezuela-maduro-arrest-juan-guaido-200214185506708.html"

86658,2020-04-14T18:08:11Z,1,[19.0],[19.0],"In February 2020 Maduro said that Guaido “will be in jail for all the crimes he’s committed”. Guaido arrived back in Venezuela 3 days before that statement and he was not arrested or detained. Maduro said “that day hasn’t come yet… But it will come”. Apparently, he is waiting for Venezuela’s justice system to decide that Guaido should be imprisoned. Fast forward to last month, State prosecutors in Venezuela have summoned Guaido for an attempted coup d’état, adding to the long list of legal cases against Guaido. Despite this, he has never been arrested and I doubt this case alone will change his chances of arrest or detainment in the short term. The incentive to arrest or detain Guaido peaked last year and was matched by the opportunity to do so. A shattered economy, multiple protests, and snowballing support for Guaido put pressure on Maduro to act. He did not arrest or detain him because it would have been political suicide. Maduro will know that arresting/detaining Guaido in the middle of huge protests would add fuel to the fire. It would bolster his support and portray him as the oppressed anti-Maduro figurehead to Venezuelans. Furthermore, the United States has warned Maduro that arresting Guaido would be his “last mistake”. In my opinion Venezuela is about to go through some extraordinarily turbulent times, starting imminently. COVID-19, the oil crisis (including Rosneft stopping operations in Venezuela), inflation, emigration, and sanctions will desecrate its economy even further. If past trends continue this will trigger mass protests. This means the arrest or detainment of Guaido would be unlikely. However, Maduro may believe that arresting Guaido will prevent protests from growing in intensity. It may even get to a point where he has nothing to lose. Maduro tried to consolidate his power recently (extrajudicial killings) and may feel that the repercussions of actions are now smaller. There could be an accidental arrest or an arrest that has not been authorised by Maduro. A protest is a perfect environment for this. Furthermore, Guaido may commit a serious criminal offense by the end of this year which leads to his arrest or detainment. Guaido is backed very strongly by the United States. If there is intelligence that an arrest is imminent, he may be granted asylum or some form of protection. However, a previous assassination attempt showcased his vulnerability to such events. The new $15 million bounty for information resulting in Maduro's arrest slightly increases the chances of him vacating office. This would drastically reduce the chances of Guaido being detained. Overall, I believe arresting or detaining Guaido would be very damaging to Maduro. A skilled and experienced political player such as himself will surely know this. However, if the legal case against Guaido starts to intensify it would increase the chances of arrest. An unauthorized arrest/mistake is a possibility, but it is unlikely. Maduro has been in many very difficult situations before and always seems to find a way to survive. However, the current unprecedented events may cause unexpected outcomes."
