However, Rokita and Messer apparently hate each other so I suspect they end up spending most of their time attacking on another while Braun is richer and thus able to self fund his own operation and get left alone. As well, according to the one poll (admittedly funded by Rokita) from this year, Rokita is in the lead."

I ranked them all relatively low because there is a competitive upcoming republican primary, and it is hard to determine which of the three will pull through at this point. I ranked none of the above higher than all of these candidates, around a 50/50 shot because I believe the current Senator for Indiana, because of his incumbency advantage is more likely to win again but because Indiana can be a typically Republican state, he is also at risk for losing his seat as a democrat."
