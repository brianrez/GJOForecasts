Although I think it's really unlikely, there are a few things that could potentially delay the reopening. In my mental model, it's something like a 97% chance the restrictions are lifted May 19th. In the unlikely event that the restrictions are not removed, there will be sustained pressure on elected leaders to relax the restrictions as quickly as possible and there would be a few weeks for that to happen after May 19th but before this question expires. Now that the May 19th date is out there though, it would be pretty politically unpopular to walk it back unless something unexpected happens."

As of today, 31% of NYC is fully vaccinated and 44% have had at least one dose (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data-vaccines.page), and the numbers jump to 39% and 54% if only considering adults. I was expecting more, given all the talk about reopening, but at 50k vaccines/day (not sure why it's been slowing down this month) we could anticipate reaching 70% herd immunity in... ~2.5 months?

If anything, New York is not a state likely to open up too fast given the mostly liberal ideology there and the risk of losing control of the 8M population (assumption). If I see that other states currently at 75% approach 85% or more, I will adjust. Though I also doubt this because essentially 85% or more is a full opening. The highest I can see it is 80%, especially in the time frame. With the current global situation (take Canada's rise in cases and protests on local governments about the rise in cases), I think NYC leaders will keep a buffer to help promote both revitilization of the city but also maintain the optimum health and safety of its population. If the global trend suddenly drops, then maybe NYC and other areas like it may reconsider the full opening. In terms of vaccines, the city is almost a third vaccinated (at least one dose) but it still has a positive growth in cases and test positivity rate.

On the other hand, immunity levels are also increasing rapidly, summer is around the corner, and it's going to be hard politically to defend restrictions when everyone who wants to be is vaccinated. On the third hand (ahem), Cuomo is under a lot of pressure politically, and the ultimate decision rests with him. But cases are currently so high and increasing so fast that I'm going to revise my forecast down drastically. I don't think they're going to be able to slow cases down fast enough to get to 100% capacity with indoor dining at 50% capacity as it is now.

99857,2021-03-26T19:58:01Z,1,[97.0],[97.0],"As of Mar 26 28% of NY state has 1 dose, 15% have 2. ~1% of the population is vaccinated/day (single dose). With 97 days to go and supply increasing it's likely by July 1 anyone who wants the vaccine will be able to get it. Barring unforseen circumstances it's likely the city will push hard for full re-opening before the busy summer tourist season and be in as good a position as anywhere to proceed."
767,2021-03-26T18:55:37Z,1,[50.0],[50.0],"The mayor just announced a goal of 5 million doses by June 1 (3.5M given out already). That's not even 3 million people fully vaccinated out of the city's 8 million pop. and we have not even started dealing with true vaccine hesitancy numbers. But between vaccinated and natural immunity, we can head into a semi-normal summer. At least we hope, until we see numbers of places like Chile, Germany, Italy, France that have had to impose restrictions after openings (Chile included despite its successful vaccination campaign). Most people in the city wear masks. People have real lockdown fatigue and the moment temps warm up, big numbers are heading out (which is not as bad but this means gatherings). We're confident, but cautious. 85% is a high number and indoor dinning has many risks but with workers vaccinated, businesses tend to have a more laissez faire attitude. Our govs are definitely ok with cases, hospitalizations and deaths as long as they're manageable. The one thing that may prevent going to 85% is optics... The mayor has stopped reporting deaths daily for a while now (even though bet. 45-75 people die daily in the city from Covid in the past 2 months)"
691,2021-03-26T17:46:25Z,1,[25.0],[25.0],"As the mayor in ""Ghostbusters"" pointed out, ""Being miserable and treating other people like dirt is every New Yorker's god-given right,"" and the current mayor is nobody's role model for any of the three C's: competence, consistency, or courage. Expanded customer loads will be permitted as soon as the temperature is above 20 or 21C for three or four days in a row."
100023,2021-03-26T17:45:44Z,1,[25.0],[25.0],"Currently, COVID infection rate stats in NYC are among the worst in the country (COVIDactnow.org gives it a ""very high risk"" status). There are also several more infectious variants known to be in the state as well. This prediction is based on whether vaccination rates keep pace with the spread of the variants. I'm also factoring in the possibility of political distraction due to calls for Andrew Cuomo's resignation."

100020,2021-03-26T17:29:35Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"Even if the vaccination rate in the US is rising quickly and significantly I don't think the government is going to risk the health situation by permitting indoor dining to this extent this soon. Especially as temperatures will allow for outdoor dining. Take away and delivery service are well established, eating out not the only way of getting other food than home-cooked."
