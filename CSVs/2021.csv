The infighting between two former rivals, President Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, the chief executive, has created stagnation on almost every front. Even as insurgents have increased their attacks, the government still doesn’t have a confirmed intelligence chief and minister of defense, because Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah cannot agree. --- http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/world/asia/kabul-explosion-afghanistan.html"

Kerry met with President Ashraf Ghani and his political rival, Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, and led a meeting of senior officials from both governments. The agreement brokered in 2014 called for holding parliamentary elections within two years -- delayed a year already -- and a loya jirga, a grand assembly of elders from across the country, to amend the Constitution and change Abdullah’s role of chief executive to the position of prime minister."

This in the wake of Saudi recognition of India and overtures to develop defense ties puts the Pakistanis on notice that refusing to help them in Yemen had a cost. Historically Afghanistan has gained influence in Pakistan when they are loosing influence elsewhere. Iran and Pakistan have moved the line of influence back and forth many times over the 11/2 centuries and such a swing is in motion again and Since it was State and not defense one assumes it was about Gov't and ergo ministries. Iraq is also trying to seat a new gov't and have come under Iranian influence. So - a deal is in the works to keep the new India/Saudi alliance from creating a power hub that can't easily be countered and an effort is in play to not allow the Iranians to demonstrate a plausible need for nukes since Saudi Defense forces took physical possession of the ones they have bought from Pakistan was is in such bad economic straights they were seeking an IMF loan to float the Gov't. Since our military is vastly reduced form 2007 and we are committing to more troops in country in Iraq it creates a resource allocation and vacuum that could set off a Nuke Race.
