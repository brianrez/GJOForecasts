Will a member of the National League for Democracy (NLD) take office as president of Myanmar before April 2016?,2015-12-08T18:22:15Z,2016-03-30T13:41:46Z,Yes,"['Yes', 'No']",['Non-US Politics'],969,654,309,237,"After November's parliamentary elections, the opposition National League for Democracy is on track to form the next government once parliament is seated in January 2016, but longstanding tensions between the NLD and Myanmar's military leaders could derail the process (NYTimes, The Diplomat, Foreign Policy, Irrawaddy). 3/2/16: Per GJI's time policy, the deadline for this question is 31 March at 11:59:59 Pacific time, which will be 1 April at 1:29:59 pm in Myanmar. Because 1:29 is a somewhat artificial deadline and we want forecasters to focus on the NLD taking office, not the exact timing during the day, we will treat any transition on 1 April (Myanmar time) as counting towards this resolution.
