Seems like at least 25 in May (maybe 50bps) and then another 25 (maybe 50 now!) in June. From there I will begin to consider if they pause at some point (Maybe July?) but for now it seems they are keen to hike more aggressively. Bond market action seems relatively supportive. Despite an aggressive flattening of the 2Y10Y (may invert!) the 3M10Y is staying significantly higher. Suggests market is accepting the pace of hikes and is pricing in a ""soft landing"" (somewhat like 1994). So the only thing in my view that would stop the Fed's outlook would be a significant slowdown in the economy which appears unlike (for now, but let's have an eye on how bad energy/food prices get and if that impacts agg. demand)."

If there is no raise in May, the June will likely be higher. On the other hand if the the Fed is trying to be aggressive, they could raise three meetings in a row.
