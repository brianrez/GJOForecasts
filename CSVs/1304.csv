The heuristics-and-biases research program highlights reasons for expecting people to be poor intuitive forecasters. This article tests the power of a cognitive-debiasing training module (“CHAMPS KNOW”) to improve probability judgments in a four-year series of geopolitical forecasting tournaments sponsored by the U.S. intelligence community. Although the training lasted less than one hour, it consistently improved accuracy (Brier scores) by 6 to 11% over the control condition. Cognitive ability and practice also made largely independent contributions to predictive accuracy. Given the brevity of the training tutorials and the heterogeneity of the problems posed, the observed effects are likely to be lower-bound estimates of what could be achieved by more intensive interventions. Future work should isolate which prongs of the multipronged CHAMPS KNOW training were most effective in improving judgment on which categories of problems.

I'd give the vote a 60% chance to fail.

This option is less likely. Then bear in mind that a GOP senate and a GOP WH can run a nominee thru fast according to history https://www.nbcnews.com/card/how-long-does-it-take-confirm-supreme-court-judge-n735771 The only question is if the past senates where this occured were treated well by the WH and due to that lubricity there was bipartisan support. If that were the case, it would not apply to this Senate which is highly partisan and combative. So I do not have faith in a short nominee confirmation cycle.

And the longer this rolls out, the worse the public political backlash will be (for both sides) as it makes both sides look bad and increases the likelihood of every angry person going to the polls in the midterms, which usually doesn't work out so well for incumbents. Also, they need another judge on the bench now for the Oct session of SCOTUS and they need it before the midterms, which are too close to gamble with.

Experiments 1 and 2 revealed that people responded to taboo trade-offs that monetized sacred values with moral outrage and cleansing. Experiments 3 and 4 revealed that racial egalitarians were least likely to use, and angriest at those who did use, race-tainted base rates and that egalitarians who inadvertently used such base rates tried to reaffirm their fair-mindedness. Experiment 5 revealed that Christian fundamentalists were most likely to reject heretical counterfactuals that applied everyday causal schemata to Biblical narratives and to engage in moral cleansing after merely contemplating such possibilities. Although the results fit the sacred-value-protection model (SVPM) better than rival formulations, the SVPM must draw on cross-cultural taxonomies of relational schemata to specify normative boundaries on thought."

Here are takeaways: Kavanaugh would oppose attempts by agencies to exercise legislative, executive and judicial functions. Kavanaugh has raised concerns in judicial opinions about ongoing violations of the U.S. Constitution’s separation of powers. He contends that the judicial branch has enabled, rather than checked, Congressional delegations of authority to the executive branch. Kavanaugh has a critical record of Chevron deference—the practice of federal courts deferring to a agency interpretations of ambiguous statutory language. He has described the principle as “an a textual invention by the courts” that shifts power from Congress to the executive branch. He has described independent agencies as the “headless fourth branch of the U.S. Government,” and warned that they threaten individual liberties and the system of checks and balances."

1333,2018-07-27T22:57:54Z,12,[8.0],[1.0],"Sen. Chuck Grassley (R), chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, stated earlier this week that the confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh will likely be held in early September. Let’s catch up on recent events. The Judicial Crisis Network began a new round of ads this week targeting U.S. Senate Democrats in West Virginia, North Dakota, Indiana, and Alabama. This ad buy brought the network's total spending in support of Kavanaugh's confirmation to $5.3 million. In West Virginia (Joe Manchin), North Dakota (Heidi Heitkamp), and Indiana (Joe Donnelly), Democratic incumbents are involved in battleground midterm re-election campaigns. Both the Judicial Crisis Network (pro-Kavanaugh confirmation) and Demand Justice (opposed to Kavanaugh confirmation) have been spending money since the nomination announcement. Demand Justice plans to spend $5 million throughout the confirmation process. A Quinnipiac University poll found that 41 percent of voters thought the Senate should not confirm Kavanaugh, while 40 percent thought it should. The one-point difference was within the poll’s +/- 3.4 percent margin of error. Kavanaugh met with Sen. Rand Paul (R) on Tuesday. Sen. Joe Manchin (D) said he will meet with Kavanaugh on July 30, becoming the first Democratic senator to schedule a meeting with the judge. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D) said he would not meet with Kavanaugh until the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee agreed on which documents about Kavanaugh's history should be released. The nugget in the papers are the Clinton files. *8% chance I'd say till we see if Paul Ryan agrees to protect the Clinton documents at all, till after the election, or kicks"
