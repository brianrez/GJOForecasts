On Monday, news broke that an infected patient had made it to Goma, eastern Congo’s biggest city. By Tuesday, he was dead. Goma has a population of 2m, densely crowded between Lake Kivu and an active volcano. It borders Gisenyi, a city in Rwanda. The Congolese government says it has identified everyone who might have met the dead patient; many are already vaccinated and the rest should be soon. But WHO officials will worry that if they missed somebody, the disease could spread quickly through Goma or across the border. The declaration does not necessarily change policy much; the WHO are warning against border closures and travel restrictions. But it may raise some more cash, which is running out fast.“"

While it doesn't spread until contact with bodily fluids is made (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/transmission/index.html) in a warzone it is conceivable that acts of rape or murder will expose persons to the virus more readily.

Add in the political chaos and people trying to get away from the conflict and the disease and it seems inevitable someone with the disease will make it out. As animals spread it as well, they are not bound by borders. In addition the country has outlets on a lake/river and the ocean, an easy way to spread the disease (https://geology.com/world/africa-satellite-image.shtml). Past history (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/history/distribution-map.html) shows a wide dispersion of ebola events. Burial customs of intimate contact (https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/SSHAP_burial_funeral_and_mourning_practices.pdf) as well as strong desire to be buried in homelands exacerbate the problems. This April 2019 WHO report (https://www.who.int/csr/don/11-april-2019-ebola-drc/en/) indicates that the management of this outbreak is facing problems in resources and capacity to isolate patients. The only contraindication for spread is that compared to other diseases it is slow to spread (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/health/how-ebola-spreads/?noredirect=on)...it takes 9 to 15 days for 1 person to infect 2...I note the numbers jumped from 2297 to 2338 in just 5 days. The question wasn't focused on how many would get the disease, just if one person might in another country, bordering and not bordering. Finally, in the last major outbreak there were several people who, via air flight, made it to other countries before showing symptoms. The theory of complexity (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity_theory) explains how we mis-focus our fight against disease on treating everyone rather than focusing on the few who spread it via multiple social contacts. A part of that theory (the 6-degrees of separation phenomena [more likely a few more than that] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation ) shows that we are all much closer than we think-- it takes a relatively few relationships to be connected to one of the victims."
