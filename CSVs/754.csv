I was surprised to learn the other day from Amy Klobuchar that there have been 160 of these carve-outs over the years. If I had realized that from the get-go, I would have asked for a clarification earlier and made significantly different forecasts. 3) I took too literally the opposition of Manchin & Sinema to changing the filibuster. I was a bit too cynical about their determination to make something work. 4) I was surprised that the Admins considered that the one-time carve-out satisfied the question. I ASSUMED (um!) that it would take a permanent change to the filibuster rules to make this question resolve as ""yes"". @Leifkj, @belikewater"

Then - we don't know because Dem leadership is being extremely tight-lipped, but given the stakes if neither bill can be passed (think: midterms and what Dem prospects would look like with versus without the voting rights bills enacted) the hope is that Manchin will indeed go along with a filibuster-carve-out for voting rights.

I'm somewhat more hopeful that they might pass a reform to return the filibuster to something more like the classic ""talking filibuster"", but that would not fulfill the criteria for this question. We should know by the end of September. If nothing happens by then, it is extremely unlikely to happen during the last quarter, because it would really be too late to enact voting rights reform in time for the 2022 mid-terms. (And the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act could conceivably be passed, and perhaps more likely to be passed in early 2022 - it would also require filibuster reform but the would be past the deadline of the question)."

Another key test point is going to be the infrastructure bill. Without significant concessions to the Republicans, sixty votes seems highly unlikely.

Sen. Manchin's OpEd in the Washington Post had sounded categorical against any significant reform, but the pundits are saying ""Never say never"" and suggesting that he was focused primarily on the infrastructure bill(s). But I'm keeping my eye on HR1/S1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement bill. Manchin has definitely signaled that he favors picking apart S1 and trying to encourage GOP to support one or two elements within it (e.g., early voting, the Native American Voting Rights Act, election security and/or transparency in campaign finance). But if (as I suspect) there are not 10 GOP Senators who can get on board any of those provisions, then I can envision Manchin making a ""heroic"" decision to add ""voting rights"" to the category of items that should not be subject to a filibuster. Even that decision, however, carries with it the risk that Republicans, if they gain a majority, could use the precedent to ram voter suppression laws thru in the name of combating ""voter fraud."" Very tricky calculations that will depend in part on polling estimates (themselves not all that reliable) about the fate of the Dem majority in either/both chambers later this year. They really want at least some elements in place in time for the 2022 midterm elections."

Multiple commentaries suggest that Mitch McConnell's (R, KY, minority leader) ""Scorched Earth Senate"" remarks will only make it harder to keep the filibuster in place in the current form and frequency, since the Democrats always have to fear a change to their own slim majority even before 2022 midterm elections, and the filibuster is the main reason for the current ""gridlock in the Senate to get things done"". The main reason: limiting the filibuster is just a tactical consideration, it does not even require an amendment to the constitution (even though the republican party likes to treat it if it was an institution of constitutional rank and value). Mitch McConnell and his power politics in turn seem to have scorched the Senate long ago, and it's the filibuster that is blocking even the firefighters."

Each party has made a change to the filibuster after gaining control in the last 2 swings (2013 and 2017), so the recent precedence in there. Ongoing protests continue to provide pressure from below while support from key figures provides it from above. More importantly, however, it appears the American people are reaching a breaking point with platitudes from politicians. Many are now demanding more than prayers and investigations, they are demanding actual, substantive change. This is one of the easiest ways to achieve a tangible result to point to with supporters without sticking your neck out politically. On top of this, Democrats have a ton of legislative proposals that have been killed in the Senate in large part due to the filibuster and are therefore further incentivized to pass this particular piece of legislation quickly once they win the Senate. Not doing so would risk a stalemate in their first years in charge which could drive voters pack to the GOP. Politically speaking, if the Dems win the Senate, this move just makes sense"

As can been seen from a brief glance at the dates however, this doesn’t present a full picture. The Senate tends to go through phases where it fits the majority party’s interest to alter procedure for partisan reasons and when these periods occur the usually last about 4 years (1975-9, 2013-7) but can go as long as 7 (1979-1986).

There ought to be quite a bit of pent up anger/demand to do major things if not simply to reverse some of the damage done over the last 4 years.

Democrats may want to push this through but it does not seem to be a major priority and again, the filibuster serves a purpose: it serves to slow things down when you don't have the votes to vote down a bill and I'm not sure that's a power that either party will want to limit. I'll ""intuit"" a number and say there's a slither of a chance: 15%."

I expect that today's crises will continue to unfold, putting public pressure on Congress to legislate equity and justice matters that won't find a place in the budget reconciliation process. Whether the majority is R or D, it'll be a narrow majority with a minority that's ready to fight for every inch. The nuclear option happened twice in the last decade. In 2013 Senator Reid and the Democrats excluded executive branch nominations and Federal court appointments. In 2017 Senator McConnell led Republicans to extend the exclusion to Supreme Court Justices, ending debate on the nomination of Gorsuch. The procedural tactic of voting to end filibuster on a matter is becoming normalized, and there will be great pressure to end it for certain legislative matters. I assign a modest 59% to this prediction because I expect the Democrats to take the Senate by only 2 to 4 seats, and while that's enough to invoke the nuclear option, not all Democrats are on board so it will take time for the party to negotiate. I'm sleepy that it will get done before 2022, but the pressure crisis may have the last word."

Republicans have no pending legislation and are unlikely to put forward any that may benefit from the updated filibuster and, moreover, will be wary of switching the requirements in case the Democrats ever obtain a majority. If anything, it is more likely they will remove the ability to filibuster from the nomination process to make confirmations and appointments easier in the coming months, but even that is unlikely given the risk of Democratic control. I give it about a 35% chance the Democrats win the Senate, in which case there is a good chance they remove the filibuster from key legislation, and around a 3% chance the Republicans remove the filibuster for nominations if they do maintain control.
