Which main character will be the first to die in Season 6 of the Walking Dead?,2015-09-08T20:00:14Z,2016-10-23T17:00:32Z,All of the above will survive season 6,"['All of the above will survive season 6', 'Glenn', 'Rick', 'Carl', 'Daryl', 'Carol']",['Entertainment'],1527,654,482,237,"This question was closed on option ""All of the above will survive season 6"" with an end date of 23 October 2016. The season 7 premier revealed that all of the characters listed in this question survived season 6. “[The midseason premiere] is a huge turning point for Rick and the group, because there’s a lot of chaos and it’s very brutal,” says executive producer and creator Robert Kirkman. 4/15/16: The finale of the Walking Dead's Season 6 left us with a cliffhanger and an unresolved question: Did someone die at the end of the episode and, if so, who? We've decided to keep the question open until the answer to that question is revealed. We'll close the question once we know the identity of anyone who died at the end of Season 6 and all forecasts made until closing will count. If it becomes clear that none of the characters listed in the question died in Season 6, then we'll resolve on option F.

One supposes that means he survived season 6, at least in the real world. However, since as I understand it he was killed in the last round of season 6 action, albeit after the cameras were shut down and everyone had got on the bus to go home, whoever scores this may decide he didn't survive season 6. Still working very hard to care about this."

So, it seems pretty fair to assume that Glenn is dead (80% -- though could be higher), and the question remains whether he died at the last moment of season 6 (60%, someone was smashed with a baseball bat after all) or the first moments of season 7 (40%). My model puts it at 48%, so let's go ahead and call it 50% :)"

Probability should be near 0% for Michonne, but the writers here are terrible, which makes them a bit unpredictable (yes, they might actually kill off another black character despite serious issues with this from past seasons, and giving up on great comic book material). Given the cast's reactions to the scene, I think it is Daryl, despite knowledge from the comic books that it might be Glenn. So I've split between those two characters, favoring Daryl as the victim. Say it isn't so, though, because I love Daryl's character (as well as Glenn's). Whoever it is, it will be hard to see."

When she left before, she was gone for some time, and with the season coming to an end soon, I think Carol's return might be next season. In the meantime, rumor has it that this season ends on a cliffhanger, in that someone gets killed, but we don't know who. So, potentially, this question won't be resolved until next season. Which leaves me puzzled, because it will lead to plenty of water cooler talk, the result of which is that everyone will think it's Glenn that bought it. But... that wouldn't be much of a shock at the next season opener for us to learn that it wasn't indeed Glenn. These questions, asking us to analyze fiction, are extremely frustrating, because a good story is based on surprise. I wish I had never gotten involved in this one."

Carol and Daryl ""should"" have died if the comics were being followed, and I believe Glenn next - but Daryl is the most popular character, and Rick is the ""main"" character who survives the comics, so their deaths are most unlikely. The other three are very slightly more killable - Carl is young and kinda annoying, Carol is a woman, which seems to increase the chances of death, and Glenn - despite being hugely popular hasn't quite left the window of death as Negan is supposed to kill him. I should probably have him higher, but his popularity is such they'll probably kill Maggie instead."

If the writers were to take out a main character it would have to be either Glenn or Maggie. But I am still exceptionally doubtful that they would at this point. Without the characters the plot fails stand out (ex recent episode in which the group holed up with two injured and instead of leaving them locked in a safe cleared room and coming back for them Michone et al risk taking them into fighting on the street - something that should've never happened with their experience at this point - every live human is valuable) in my humble opinion. Love the series but hoping the writers will adopt the survivors experience and mentality when writing, allowing the characters we love to make those blunt hard choices to survive consistently."

WD is Rick's story, so he's safe, as is, most likely, Carl (both still alive in comics). Both Carol & Daryl are huge fan favorites (along with Glenn), so killing them would spark all sorts of fan outcries. Carol probably is more likely than Daryl to be killed, but they may go for a finale shocker with Daryl instead of Glenn. I think the show might pick off some of the other characters first (e.g. Alexandria members Spencer/Denise/Jesse) or they might go after Abraham (since he got his personal focus ep in the first half & b/c of the comics), Morgan, or even Glenn's pregnant wife Maggie before the poll characters."

I'll leave it at 50% for now. Carol and Daryl are both loved by audiences. So they could be killed to great effect. Daryl is a very sympathetic character, but Carol has a dark side. So audiences would be more accepting that this was her fate. P.S. had to change my numbers because it only allowed a total of 100%.

His time may be coming if they stay true to the comics, I just don't think it'll occur this season. Carol is a non-zero possibility. She's a little reckless at times and I can see her involvement leading to some sort of accidental death. But it's still a long shot. Carl is also a decent possibility, especially with Ron twice already intending on killing him. In the end, I think season six ends with all 5 main characters alive."

The others are fairly tough and stand little chance of be killed off by the writers for various reasons. Viewers would be outraged if Rick is killed off - he's the central character that bind the rest together and viewers love him. Carl is his son and need to watch out for his sister - babies can't die. Carol is tough as nails...she can survive anything now. Darly probably has the second greatest chance of the group of being killed off but I didn't put more weight on him mainly because I think Glenn is the one to go.

He is an outsider in the new community dynamics therefore he is susceptible to high risk isolated events that will leave him vulnerable. However, he is lower percentage than Glenn beacause he is an outsider which positions him for a dramatic comeback. Glenn is a highly sympathetic and likable guy with low potential for controversy (less plot development and story line potential) which bumps up his probability. Carl also would provide shock value and his death would feed the story line, but I don't think he has served out his potential yet especially now with other new characters coming into play that are his same age as well as coming into age that is known to rebel against parents (i.e. High drama potential with Rick and other kids). This will also connect with a lot of viewers on a personal level also bumping up both Rick and Carl's survivability. Carol is in full bloom right now as far as storyline and character development unlike Glenn who is at end of line, so she is a no go."
