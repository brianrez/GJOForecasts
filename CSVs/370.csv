As people continue to move back to the office in 2022, it remains to be seen to what extent that will balance out with new and existing office space.I'm a little behind on this question, as the Q2 data came out in August. Given that the slightly upward trend continues, I'm lowering my forecast on bin 2 substantially. I think it would be hard for the rate to plunge from 15.1% in Q2 to 14.0% or below in 2 quarters, especially as the rate has been growing for at least the past 5 quarters, starting at 14.7%. I don't know whether such a drop would be unprecedented, but imo, it seems very unlikely for such an illiquid commodity. Similarly, a move to below 12.5% or above 17.0% would seem extremely unlikely (<0.5%), as well. Given that Q2 is at 15.1% and that the trend in the vacancy rate has been approximately +0.1% each quarter, I don't think bin 4 is completely out of the question, but it would seem very unlikely, too. Given the Q2 value of 15.1% and the increasing trend of ~0.1%/month for the past 5 quarters, I think bin 3 is most likely at this time."

I think it's more likely than not that we haven't seen the peak yet. Even so, I do not see office space vacancies falling as quickly as they rose like we saw with unemployment. Looking back at 2016 - 2019, the quarterly increments were all 0.0%, 0.1%, or 0.2%.

Perhaps the vacancy rate in 2022 Q2 will be similar to the vacancy rate in 2021 Q2, after a rise (to as high as ~17% in Q1 2022) and fall, and vacancy rates may continue to decline further at that point.
