It seems the Gilt rate creep in UK and bond creep elsewhere has not concerned the BoE. The unanimity of the MPC seems clear about the current course of action - https://bit.ly/3vGdYuS. As the next MPC is 6 May and IMHO there's little likelihood of change in between now and then, as the BoE appears to be hesitant to not move too early on the upside as that may choke off any signs of a recovery, I will retain my forecast. Maintaining the current rate and asset purchases does leave the BoE some room to manoeuvre should the need arise. The flip side, and what the MPC seems to be thinking is that there's likely to be a relatively strong rebound in spending resulting from the vaccination program, the governments support program and the announced schedule for the easing of the lock down / restrictions. There is increasing talk that 'pent up spending' in UK and USA will contribute significantly to this rebound. That may contribute to the BoE's 2% inflation target. However, the BoE is also cognisant of the unemployment rate."

The nearest-neighbour linearly interpolated spot value of 7th May-maturity OIS rates on 29/12/20 was 0.03 (https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/yield-curves), so the market expectation seems to be that the Bank's base rate is 0.03/360 = 0.008%, with negative rates expected only in January 2022. But the 7th May expected rate seems to approximately follow an unbiased Gaussian random walk over time, with a typical 30-day change over the last 6 months of 0.010%. Supposing it matches the true rate at maturity, the implied probability of a negative rate is 35%."

So clearly the BOE both need, to and are willing, to consider negative rates.

88707,2020-12-12T00:32:01Z,1,[20.0],[20.0],"Interesting question. Bank rate is 0.1% at the moment after they lowered it from 0.75% in March. Usually they seem to change it by 0.25% when they do change it. I deem it likely the Brexit negotiations won't reach an agreement before the new year which likely be another hit to an already weakened economy. The only stimulus Bank of England can use, to my knowledge, is the Bank Rate. So a slam dunk yes? No, I'm not so sure they really want to go below zero. While it as to some extent worked in other countries it is not a normal state of economic affairs and there is a risk of confidence crisis I they do it I think. While only the investigation into the possibility of setting a negative interest rate can have negative impact, it also shows the markets Bank of England still has some tools left in the tool box which inspires some confidence."
