But simply looking at the number of areas of protests on the maps for each update and reading for the updates, it looks as though the protests may be decreasing (or at least becoming concentrated in certain areas and mixed with other motivations besides the symbol of the hijab) -- this suggests to me a pattern of dispersal and weakening rather than intensification."

Therefore, I would expect this rate to decline as the protests lose momentum, or suddenly spike due to a crackdown then drop precipitously as the protestors retreat.

These 2022 protests have averaged maybe about 200 deaths per month, meaning this is killing people at a rate 2 to 3 times more than 2019 to 2020 for comparison. Assuming 200 deaths a month for the next 3 months, that's 600 more to come, on top of 200 already in the tally: 800 by question's close. However, this aforementioned model is linear, and there is a good chance these protests and their accompanying death tolls do not behave linearly.
