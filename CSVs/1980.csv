That's why they have continued to have been been allies of sorts despite all that weirdness. Fairly or not, the Chinese public tends to see North Koreans as criminals, lazy, pathological liars, incompetent. The Chinese government has been encouraging citizens along the border to form militias, a scary thing for the government to do, suggesting desperation. Also, China has built a bridge to nowhere across the Yalu river bordering the two nations, quite substantial. https://www.nknews.org/2014/10/new-yalu-river-bridge-opening-postponed/"

They've tested missiles before, taken hostages and pulled all kinds of stunts. The UN has bigger problems right now, and further sanctions will only give NK the international attention that it craves. It's clear that sanctions aren't working, and the US and China will probably privately agree to another means of deterrent."
