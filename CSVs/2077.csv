Reports say this is most likely to create a domino effect which would make smaller parties follow increasing the chances of Rousseff losing the impeachment votes. But the impeachment proceedings are most likely to start next month -the date of April 17 has been floating around - thus I will leave the forecast unchanged."

Michel Temer, the PMDB boss, who as vice-president takes over if deputies vote to send impeachment proceedings to the Senate for trial, has also been busy over Easter, promising posts in his own putative administration.

Ms. Rousseff hasn’t been implicated in the sprawling corruption investigation at Petróleo Brasileiro SA, as the oil company is officially known, and has denied knowledge of the graft ring.

It may not occur in Brazil, or maybe it will. It can be generally described as an awakening to the notion that: ""Error had been routed, and now science could advance."" I'm thinking it's a notion, still formative, seeking representation (expression) through communicative symbols. Maybe it will blossom in Brazil this week. It's a notion that, once embodied, will cause even the most ardent communist worker to pause, reflect, and say: ""They have dragged this country through three years of total crap and they were aware of the ""error"" the entire time."" Again, think about this. An ""error"" was alleged three years ago. An epistemological error. Those in the position to correct this error remained silent, causing millions to remain in error, for three years. Maybe I am wrong, and this is not a new element in the current psyche, or not a matured element, or neither in Brazil. It probably won't happen this week. It hasn't happened for three years.

There has been some substantial progress with the proceedings since then, and Barclays’ Bruno Rovai wrote to clients that Rousseff’s chances of impeachment were rising once again. Over the last week her campaign manager was arrested over illegal payments received in his party’s offshore accounts. Also Rousseff’s own party is disagreeing with her economic agenda, and social movements have started showing signs of not approving of her agenda (there are protests scheduled for March 13). Rousseff’s approval rating is 11, down from 12% in December. Rovai personally believes that “the longer the impeachment process lies in the House of Representatives, the higher the likelihood that it will be approved.” Therefore it seems like Rousseff will be impeached eventually, just not necessarily within the month. The House of Representatives has been very slow-moving up to this point, therefore I do not think that there will be a mad rush to impeach her as soon as possible."

It seems that focusing on a single date makes predictions less valuable than otherwise they would be if GJP allowed forecasters to choose among various ranges of dates. The WTI question earlier in the season was a prime example...the price of oil hit below $34 within a week of the ending date on the question.

498,2016-02-26T06:53:05Z,55,[7.0],[0.0],"What's becoming ever more clear in this Petrobas / Rousseff scandal is that the corruption: a) has been going for a very long-time across multiple administrations, and b) that it was seemingly ""brought into"" Brazil in some fashion. That is, it is not the result of a scheme that spontaneously created itself out of some random collection of transactions and indigenous individuals. It is far too comprehensive and inter-connected for that. It has individuals participating in activities that are out of the realm of their personal expertise. Many, many people performing functions, yet none seemingly sophisticated or capable enough to organize those functions. So I'm beginning to think the Brazilian thing tied into a pre-existing international network rather than just mushrooming from any set of internal schemes. These participants have been taught how to engage in such interrelated complexity on a massive scale. I haven't followed the scandal in detail at all really, so I do not know, but it's beginning to smell that way. I'll be curious to learn if this recent Santana catch is just another role participant, or more of an overall organizer."

This is not the same as resignation neither impeachment. Resignation would require President Rousseff choosing to leave office; Impeachment would require both Parlament Houses to agree that President Rousseff should indeed leave office; 'Impugnação de Campanha' or campaign contestation would require the Highest Electoral Court (TSE - Tribunal Superior Eleitoral) to agree that her campaign was improperly conducted. With the provisional arrest of João Santana, who was President Rousseff's campaign manager in 2010 and 2014 and also Lula's in 2006, it seems that part of the money illegally extracted from Petrobras was employed in President Rousseff's last campaign, and possibly in campaigns of some of her allies. At this point in time, given the overall fragility of Parlament Houses and popular unrest, it seems to me that 'impugnação' became more feasible. And, if Parlament Reps are seeing things the way I described, I bet they would be less motivated to risk their public positions to pursue Rousseff's impeachment. I will wait to see if there are any signs of this 'sudden unwillingness' emerging among Parlament Reps before I get it reflected in my forecast."

Both developments, I believe, will reduce the willingness of people to take part in the national demonstration scheduled for March 13th, since the press will probably be shifting focus from Lula to Cardoso in the next days and, strangely enough, will provide new arguments to President Dilma's popular base: ""you see? everyone is corrupt, so Dilma's violation of the fiscal austerity laws is not such a big deal."""

The opposition figures leading the campaign to remove Rousseff from office now admit that Rousseff's impeachment is unlikely.

He intends to run for president. His new approach positions him as the man on the steed out to save the economy to gain pedigree in the next election. If the economy fails, President Rousseff takes the blame as Vice-President Temer is not the leader but one who advised the president, the opposition. If the economy gains, he could tell voters it was due to his suggestions and fought for his interest groups. This is a fine balance, his supporters could view him as the opposition's lap dog if the economy continues to falter and his interest groups are unattended. But that is another forecast. He will not impeach during an economic slowdown unless there is another scandal that forces the president to go from office. There are factions in the opposition that would not vote for impeachment and the impeachment forecast is to close to have an impeachment and it is doubtful the president is resigning the position without pressure from the opposition and they are not willing to cause further instability in the government."

Although it is his opinion and he is clearly on the side of impeachment, he makes some interesting points about the specific charges against Rousseff, the specific Brazilian laws that were clearly broken by her administration, and the legal capacity that gives a willing congress to impeach. With 65% of public still supporting impeachment or resignation, There's plenty of reason both legally and politically to impeach. I imagine it will come down to the individual positions and legal vulnerabilities in the Petrobras scandal of the individual congress members voting. I can see I've been an outlier among forecasters in my confidence in her impeachment, but I have to stick with my gut on this one even if it costs me going against the wisdom of the crowd. http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2016/01/06/brazil-may-legitimately-impeach-its-president-heres-why/"

Brazil's economy is in a mess and a sane politician would rather not take over at this time. 2. With the high profile Olympics this year, political upheavals would be bad for Brazil's international image. 3. The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, now one of Roussef's key opponents, is facing grave legal problems himself, which reduces his credibility. 4. It is very unlikely that one third of the Chamber won't support her against a motion calling for legal proceedings, given the number of seats her party currently holds. So far nothing has been made public that would weaken her standing within the party. 5. It looks like no further proceedings will happen on this matter until March, which gets too close to the deadline. 6. She won't go quietly and is likely to fight all the way to the end if necessary."

Senator Acir Gurgacz, who is charged with reporting to the committee on a ruling by Brazil’s Federal Audit Court that the Rousseff administration broke the law by disguising spending last year, said he recommends approving the 2014 accounts. Rousseff’s opponents are seeking to impeach her alleging that she broke Brazil’s budget law by resorting to accounting tricks to hide greater public spending aimed at boosting the economy during her re-election campaign last year. Rousseff’s governing coalition has a majority of the seats on the committee, which is expected to follow Gurgacz’s lead. Should the committee vote in favour of his view and approve the 2014 government accounts, the impeachment process begun December 2 in the Lower House of Congress will lose its grounds for seeking Rousseff’s removal. ...

Add to the fact that a recent decision by the Brazilian Supreme Court has stalled the process even further since the political moves of Ms Rousseff's greatest foe and President of the Brazilian Lower House of Congress, Eduardo Cunha, were found illegal, thus calling for another vote on the committee responsible for analyzing the impeachment request. As to the possibility of Ms Rousseff resigning from office, past experience has shown that it is not in her nature to give in to political pressure, let alone own up to any wrongdoings or shortcomings relating to herself or any of her underlings, thereby warranting the conclusion of a slim chance of resignation. On the other hand, the nomination of Mr Nelson Barbosa as Finance Minister signals more of the same, i.e., that Ms Rousseff is back at the helm of economic decisions, which has already met with a backlash from the financial markets, and may add to the outcry of the Brazilian population, whose disapproval of the current administration is at 67% of the general population according to Datafolha. This could mean that more people are likely to throng to the streets in the coming months so as to make Ms Rousseff reconsider her position as head of State, which justifies a slight 5% chance of resignation before 1 April 2016."

Rousseff is in a slightly better position after court decisions last week and her poll #'s have improved slightly while Cunha's have remained rock bottom. The replacement of the finance minister and likely return to higher social spending and further growth of the deficit when the economy is shrinking foretells a bad 2016 for Brazil's economy and possibly beyond. Abandoning the hard won economic reforms thus far just to win support for her own political life should only further embolden her opponents. Perhaps the swing in opinion back her way last week may prove to be the beginning of the end of the impeachment process, but the almost daily flow of extremely bad economic news may prevent any further resurgence on her part and the impeachment drive may regain momentum after a single good week for Rousseff. http://washpost.bloomberg.com/Story?docId=1376-NZNOUN6KLVR401-1GO6M9KLFAM4J7I07CG9FU3C39 http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21684538-joaquim-levys-resignation-reason-alarm-brazils-worrying-change-finance-ministers http://en.mercopress.com/2015/12/19/rousseff-picks-barbosa-as-finance-minister-a-strong-critic-of-levy-and-austerity"

It has been estimated that Rousseff almost has enough chamber votes to block the impeachment, but I believe almost will likely not be good enough. Her approval ratings are low, and there are individuals within her party who would like to see a new president. I believe the chances that the panel brings the issue to a vote within the Chamber of Deputies are almost certain, and the probability that the Chamber of Deputies passes the measure by 2/3rds vote for review in the Senate within a month's time from the panel's decision to be very likely. She will be technically impeached according to the question if the Chamber of Deputies passes the impeachment proceedings by 2/3rds vote."

There are now two points that lead to the answer of this question. The first is: ""Is there enough time before 1 April 2016?"" As I see it, the answer is ""Barely."" The congressmen in Brazil go into recess by the end of December and return only by the beginning of February. There are a lot of steps to go, involving two reports by the special comission of the Chamber of Deputies, two votes by the Chamber as a whole, ratifying the accusation and a judgement by the Senate, each with it's own term. The opposition is moving, trying to get the Chamber to vote in January, but it is unlikely that they will succeed. The second question is the outcome of the votes. And that depends strongly on the popular support to the impeachment process, which by now is unpredictable. There are distinct sectors of the population supporting each side, and the final outcome may depend on a crucial fact, such as a piece of evidence appearing against Rousseff, or a public outcry after a confrontation results in a death on one of the sides. I'd say that the chance that she will be eventually impeached is around 30% - 40%, while the chance that she is by April 1st is much lower."

Both were jailed and tortured under military rule and having survived breast cancer, she is a proven fighter. Social programs lke La Bolsa Familia pay low income famlies to send and keep their childern in school. As a result, over the long run, Brazil will have eliminated illiteracy and brought health care to many millions who had none. Although Rouseff's approval ratings have gome down to 10% no rival poltical party seems to have the votes or incentive to bring an impeachmnet resulution. The Speaker of the Assembly and President of the Senate are both subject to bribery charges in connection with the Petrobras scandal and there is a 60% chance that each of those opponents will face separate impeachment proceedings, a 100% chance that one of those power brokers will be impeached. Plus the Vice Predident who would succeed under the constitution is from the PDMB, Rousseff and her PT party's former coalition partner. Although the VP has lots of influence, he does not have and cannot get 2/3 of the votes in the Assembly necessary to impeach Rouseff. Proof, Rouseff's veto of approximately 18 of 23 spending bills,was sustained and her opponents could not summon the 2/3 vote required to overcome veto. Now and for forseeable future Brazilian Congress will be too busy with contentious legislation cutting federal spending and continuing investigations related to Petrobras scandal, and even hearings on bills impeaching the Speaker of Assembly or the President of the Senate. The Congress cannot even take up any other matter until a budget is passed and other emergency economic matters are addressed."

Lawmakers this week for the first time formally discussed the procedures for impeachment on the floor of the lower house, asking the head of the chamber, Eduardo Cunha, for clarification on the steps required to start a process to oust the president. Brazil’s largest opposition parties now are rallying behind an impeachment request filed by Helio Bicudo, a co-founder and former member of Rousseff’s ruling Workers’ Party. ... Many legislators remain loyal to Rousseff and party leaders from the governing coalition this week denounced attempts to remove her from office, saying such a move would be a break with constitutional rule. ... “A vote on impeachment as early as this year is possible, but I can’t say that categorically,” Jose Mendonca Filho, leader of Brazil’s second biggest opposition party, said Wednesday. “From the political point of view, the questions presented on the floor yesterday were the first step toward the debate over the vote on President Dilma’s impeachment.” ... Bicudo says Rousseff should be held responsible and impeached for doctoring her government’s financial accounts, breaking campaign finance laws and allowing state-run oil company Petrobras to incur losses because of corruption. ... If impeachment proceedings are accepted by Cunha or the majority of lawmakers, a committee will discuss the request and send its recommendation to the house floor. At least 342 out of 513 lawmakers must vote for impeachment hearings to begin before the case goes to the Senate or Supreme Court, depending on the charges. Cunha already rejected five of the 18 impeachment requests sent to Congress, saying they don’t pass legal muster."

Opposition + part of the main allied party (PMDB) would already have a sketch of a plan to an eventual post-Roussef period. The option seems too risk/unnecessary considering the alternative of having the current administration putting forth the necessary fiscal measures. However, clear signs of their ability to do this (given current and potential political climate) are still to be seen. Yesterday's downgrading of investment status by S&P's is conjectured to increase the probability of a succesfull negotiation between government and Congress, but there's still uncertainty on how PMDB will actually react and even the more populist sections of Roussef's party (which until now refused to send any clear sign of favoring the measures defended by te current Finance Minister). Mr. Levy position is not secured, although S&P's decision allegedly gave him a subtle increase in importance (there's no alternative to his name right now, nobody with near equivalent levels of reputation and credentials, let alone willingness to assume such a position)."
483,2015-09-10T16:37:18Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],Though under pressure I don not think this is likely. The opposition is not strong enough nor does it have a clear figure head to rally behind
470,2015-09-10T16:12:29Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],Government is too divided. Her party would rather have her than someone from the other side. She will hang on until next election.

234,2015-09-10T05:21:29Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],Status Quo Bias - needs to be more development to get to the point of impeachment. Also not much time for proceedings to progress.

57,2015-09-10T03:46:35Z,1,[40.0],[40.0],"Considering the turmoil already in play, Brazil's credit rating being downgraded to junk rating by S&P, and her readiness to accept refugees into an already strained economy where Brazilians perceive they are not being taken care of and burdened by austerity measures, she will have a difficult time maintaining her presidency . I don't believe she will finish out her full term, but there's a chance she will survive our timeline."
424,2015-09-10T02:02:23Z,1,[25.0],[25.0],Approval Rating isn't lethal yet
420,2015-09-10T01:11:10Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],Despite the all time low approval rating and ongoing scandal and controversy I think she will attempt to ride out the storm.
64,2015-09-10T00:51:56Z,1,[30.0],[30.0],"Public-opinion and the state-of-the-nation seem heavily stacked against Rousseff, and yet this thing has been dragging on without gaining momentum. So, there must be some causal factor holding back the obvious end to her term. With my cynical hat on, I suspect the opposition would rather drag it out because they know they can't fix the state-of-the-nation, and would rather let the economy bottom before they make a real stink. But, perhaps that's too cynical and there's another reason. Either way, I'm betting that the recent past will continue -- whatever the reason."

I don't think she will be impeached because none of the other politicians or officials want to cast the first stone. Although she's one tough cookie, she may just get tired of the whole thing."

30,2015-09-09T18:43:13Z,1,[35.0],[35.0],"Rousseff may be unpopular at the moment, but it does not seem likely that she will resign or be impeached in the immediate future. As Jean-Pierre points out below, the bar needed to pursue an impeachment is quite high and a large part of the governing coalition would need to turn on Rousseff to make it happen. Resignation seems like the more probable of the two options. Even then, pressure to resign seems to mostly be coming from opposition parties, rather than from within the governing coalition at the moment."

318,2015-09-09T17:27:16Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],She's survived a very against extreme odds thus far.
309,2015-09-09T17:22:27Z,1,[30.0],[30.0],After reading the other forecasters I'm going to go with the majority on this one for now. It seems unlikely in the short term.
241,2015-09-09T13:00:01Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],"The forecasting window is too short and there is no easy mechanism to remove a president. The quickest way to do it would be a military coup, but the question omits that possibility. Impeachment proceedings take time. The Brazilian Constitution allows for a maximum of 180 days to conclude a trial. The vote threshold is very high. Impeachment in Brazil requires a 2/3 vote in the Chamber of Deputies (513 seats). The governing coalition has 285 members while the opposition has 199. So, the opposition would need to pick up 145 defectors to get to the magic number 344. This won't happen, in my opinion, unless the corruption scandals touch her personally. Low approval ratings alone won't do it."
