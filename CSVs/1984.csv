Will there be a new episode of mass killing in Ethiopia before 1 January 2017?,2016-02-02T18:00:25Z,2016-11-30T18:00:13Z,Yes,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],1352,654,283,237,"For more information on what constitutes an episode of mass killing, see the Early Warning Project’s Definitions page. Ethiopia is one of the most repressive regimes in the world. In December 2015, security forces killed over 140 people protesting city development plans (BBC). The Early Warning Project’s 2015 statistical risk assessments identify Ethiopia as one of the top 20 countries with the greatest risk of an onset of state-led mass killing. Those forecasts do not assess the risk of mass killing by non-state groups, which would also produce a “yes” answer to this question. This question will be resolved by the Early Warning Project, in consultation with subject matter experts, using publicly available secondary sources. If the project determines that a new episode of mass killing has occurred, relevant evidence will be summarized in a post on EWP's blog. Recommended Question Who will win Uganda's next presidential election? How many Eritrean citizens will apply for asylum in Europe for the first time in the first quarter of 2016? This question was closed as ""yes"" with an end date of 30 November 2016. The EWP assessed that Ethiopia experienced a new mass killing episode in 2016 (Early Warning Project).

I know the base rate here is low, but given the worst drought in 50 years, the continued Oromo problems and the January killing of 140, i think it is more likely than not at this point."

I googled the history of protests in Ethiopia I then began to consider the implication of my knowledge of protests in Ethiopia. I care about human rights and am thankful the internet is at my fingertips and more importantly am thankful that technology has enabled Ethiopians to share their stories with me. Perhaps the Ethiopian Government knows we are watching and more importantly we care what happens! Going down by 1% b/c the we are all watching what happens and we care.

What is the cutoff for a mass killing? For my estimate I was thinking of 50 people. I've looked at the source and see they defining as 1000+! I should revise down from my original 10% probability. I can't see conflict on that scale in Ethiopia in 2016. And, reading more, it looks to me like EWF's estimate for scale of casualities at the end of 2016 is highly questionable.

I will trim this forecast for the passage of time without further Oromo protests and will increase it if those protests recur and the state responds with lethal violence, or if any kind of violent Oromo insurgency starts to develop (something I consider very unlikely, because I can't see any foreign patrons backing that and it would make poor strategic sense for most Oromo)."
