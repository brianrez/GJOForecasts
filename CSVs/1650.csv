"Between 1 July 2017 and 30 June 2018, will an armed group from the Philippines engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in the Philippines?",2017-06-30T17:00:37Z,2017-10-01T06:59:37Z,Yes,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],259,654,68,237,"The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (Early Warning Project). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 30 September 2017 and will be resolved in July 2018 after EWP assesses the situation in Philippines from July 2017 through June 2018. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilian fatalities occur in one or more campaigns.

There is little doubt that armed and uniformed police and military will kill more than 1,000 civilians in this time frame. However, the Cotabato City police won't make this number, nor will the Army nor whatever the old Philippine Constabulary are parading as now. However, people with uniforms and weapons acting under the instructions or with the okey-dokey from the Prez will make this number and more easily, if they haven't done already. Since it will involve several different armed groups in several different parts of the country over an extended period, one supposes these murders will all be put down to an unhappy and coincidental series of unfortunate events rather than a ""campaign."" This will doubtless cheer up the surviving family members, if any, of the vics--who by the way will be precisely as dead as they would be if they had conformed to the official EWP definition.

The police have killed over 2,000 civilians in the campaign against drug traffickers. Whether that is an armed group engaging in a campaign policy that knowingly results in widespread civilian deaths is something the administrators will have to clarify. Considering that the question is being asked, I assume that the answer is no given that it is not a specific civilian group being targeted, but rather an ambiguous ""drug dealer"" group defined by the civilian population and the police. Therefore, I assess this as 1%, as there is no major campaign happening between armed forces that would reach this level."
