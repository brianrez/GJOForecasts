Officially, the Pinera team has not reached out for international help. But that $20 billion-- which amounts to 38% of the dollar amount the IMF doled out to the outgoing Macri regime in Argentina ($54 billion-- could get pissed away rather quickly if things continue to head south. If you read La Tercera or El Mercurio (leading Chilean dailies) online, the situation is still day to day and it would be kind to say that logistics and infrastructure are not becoming tenuous. Subway service in metro Santiago stops at around 3PM. An influential member of the Edwards (own El Mercurio and lots more clout) family who is an economist who bounces between Chile and LA has written that the nation needs to rethink its ""liberal"" model. Add to that the August statement by US Navy Admiral who is head of Southern Command to wit that he suspects that Venezuelans and their proxies are stirring up trouble in South America is now being given a special ""Chile spin"" (see Merco Press for details). No ""where's the Cuban."" Sometime after March when the $20 billion starts running low it will be tough for ""Chile Inc."" not to seek out a scapegoat."

The present one dates back to the era of Augusto Pinochet, its erstwhile dictator. Protesters argue that a new constitution should enshrine provisions for education and health care.
