SeekingAlpha was only off by 4k in their Q3 projection."

These two factors should offset on another to a large degree but even if there is a significant imbalance they should still leave me within the 280-330k band. There don't appear to be major catalysts in other markets in the immediate term that will push the total enough in either direction to move the total out of that band.

It is clear that customers are trading up their relatively cheaper vehicles to buy a Model 3 even though there is not yet a leasing option and the Q3 starting price of a Model 3 was $49,000. This leads us to believe that the total market potential for Model 3 is larger than just the premium sedan market. Additionally, we are working hard to bring down the price of Model 3 to $35,000...
