In addition, the DUP is super strong on their position and seem to want a lot out of the negotiations. What really causes me to vote 72% yes is that the DUP also seems content with a snap election. The low likelihood of an agreement by October 31st, coupled with all parties being happy with a snap election, leads me to believe that a snap election will be likely."

However, it seems that the DUP is intent on either having their tantrum heard by an increasingly apathetic Westminster or at the very least taking a shot at rewriting the May election result by stirring up unionist passions with their hardline stance.*"

Stormont has up to 24 weeks following an election to form a new executive, per the power-sharing agreement with Westminster, so the DUP always knew the deadline they were looking at. There has clearly been no progress on their side, either in terms of them moving towards resolving the situation, or a sign that their demand (the UK ditching the Northern Ireland Protocol) might be met as the new government has shown no inclination towards invoking Article 16 and has been moving closer to the EU if anything (https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2022/10/04/dublin-and-brussels-remain-cautious-over-britains-apparent-change-of-tone-on-ni-protocol/)."
