"Between 1 October 2017 and 30 September 2018, will an armed group from Zimbabwe engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Zimbabwe?",2017-09-29T17:00:18Z,2018-01-01T07:59:37Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],201,654,53,237,"The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (Early Warning Project). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 31 December 2017 and will be resolved in October 2018 after EWP assesses the situation in Zimbabwe from October 2017 through September 2018.. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilian fatalities occur in one or more campaigns.

There might be killings by troops of civilians who are not happy with the outcome of what is happening with Mugabe in Zimbabwe at present, but the chances of people killed due to looting is a bigger possibility.The reason for aforesaid is because Zimbabwe citizen are poor and all are hoping for a better outcome and life than what they had up to now. They waited for 37 years to do something to get rid of Mugabe because everybody was scared of the military who killed any person who was against Mugabe and because the military was manipulated by Mugabe. It took 37 years for one person in the military to stand up and do something. The outcome of what is happening in Zimbabwe won't be the end of what happens in other African countries. These people of Africa always look what others do and eventually try to do the same. The chances are very good that something similar is already planned by another country in Africa, depending on the outcome in Zimbabwe."
