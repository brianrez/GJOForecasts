This spread has been negative since late May - i think more from the demand by banks for overnight/short money (evidenced by bills) for reasons I do not fully understand---as it seems more of an accounting/balancing the books nightly kind-of-thing. If Powell is able to influence the very short end - it should ripple up into the two-year ---- but that is a pretty long way up the yield curve - and I don't know how tight the correlation is between a move in the bills and the 2-year yield.

This reversal feels like ""risk-on"" by traders more than it does any statement either way about the economy. Using TLT (20-year treasuries) as my guide - we're at a level of support presently at 139.50 - but it played weakly today. I'm no technician - but next level of support seems to be 130 - which translates to a yield of 2.68% from today's 2.49% if TLT continues to fall in price this week and next. And if TLT does continue to fall in price, I'd expect the 10-year yield to move upwards in similar fashion, while the two-year rate will be biased downwards because of Fed rate cutting. Thus, a likelihood of continued positive spread through Oct 31. Let's see what happens....."
