There is logic in the SPD wanting to avoid being junior coalition members and getting the blame for unpopular policies and no credit for popular policies, but will standing out this time around help them? Presumably that would only work if the CDU actually formed a government or a new election was called and the SPD got enough votes so that it could lead a coalition. A CDU minority government is (I suppose) possible, but it is not self evident that would increase support for the SDP, as a minority government would be fragile and some voters might think the SDP had just chickened out. I doubt that Germans would want an Italian style system where weak governments get replaced every few months (as they used to). The real problem is having the AfD getting votes, but the CDU ruling out a coalition with them. If other parties (those other than the AfD) will not join a CDU coalition, and these other parties do not have enough seats to form a majority themselves the only remaining option is a minority government."

The breakthrough came during talks this morning between Merkel, Horst Seehofer, leader of the Bavarian CSU, and Martin Schulz, the Social Democrat chief. The three will now recommend to their parties that they start official coalition talks. The euro rallied after the terms of the coalition deal emerged, reaching its highest level against the dollar since January 2015. The SPD will first have to give the green light for formal coalition talks, and any coalition agreement will also have to be voted on by its members.

Having observed the Green party members' »Schadenfreude« for the public perception that the Liberals would have spoiled the talks, I'm very inclined to believe the very same Liberals' account, that the negotiations had not been anywhere close to form a government. The latest draft contains 237 bracketed expressions, the Liberals say, representing roughly 100 to 130 unresolved political questions, according to newspapers. The Greens and CDU still insist that these 100 political questions could have been resolved very quickly in a matter of days, but the Liberals are very quick to enumerate so many discrepancies that nobody in the audience can't actually believe them not to exist. For a number of days, the Liberals have been venting their anger about how they had been treated in the negotiations and thereafter. It's very hard to miss the frustration, begging the question how blindsided the counterparties must have been. I personally confronted a discussion group of Green party members, about an inability to read and understand Liberal signals, and they quickly reverted into very strange defensive arguments, while portraying themselves as “open for further” re-negotiations. While not representative for the parliamentary group, party members strongly entertain the argument that the Liberals would have played and acted out a television script, merely for effect and show. I objected that the Liberals were not the enemy, to which the responses had been so hostile, I'm now convinced that the Liberals have no good reason to return to any table where the Greens have a seat."

It is quite likely that CDU-FDP will not get a majority and given how much the SPD has suffered within the grand coalition, they are reasonably likely to prefer opposition. Other coalition options will be more complicated to sort out.

Unfortunately the AFD party will most likely gain a lot of votes - this is a very worrying trend and needs to be closely watched. It almost makes the question on who will become chancellor for the next years less relevant as the support for populists is growing as can be seen in other European countries and beyond.

The election is just 19 days away and its getting harder and harder for the Party SPD and their candidate Martin Schulz to win the election.

Yesterday's prime-time TV clash had been billed as Schulz's last chance to sway a decisive share of voters to his cause and halt a devastating popularity slide. But polls following the 90-minute showdown, which was watched by 16.1m people, gave Merkel the clear edge over Schulz. During the debate, Merkel said it was clear that Turkey should not join the EU, and that she would talk to other EU leaders about ending its stalled accession process. In reaction to Merkel's comment, a spokesman for Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan accused German politicians today of indulging in populism"

Mr Schulz will attack Mrs Merkel over inequality in Germany and her plans to increase defence spending (which he says is giving in to President Donald Trump). The placid chancellor will try to engage as little as possible, reminding Germans that the country is doing well and inviting them to trust her calm temperament. Polling suggests that 48% of German voters plan to watch the tussle, of whom 22% say it could influence their decision. Mr Schulz is a good speaker and a natural pugilist; Mrs Merkel avoids verbal confrontations. This may be his best, and last, chance to turn the election around"

According to the survey, the party has just 25 percent support - well behind Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), with 39 percent. As before, the chancellor also whups her SPD challenger, Martin Schulz (pictured), in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup, 58 percent to 31 percent. The Left - the third strongest of Germany's main political parties and the SPD's potential partners in an increasingly unlikely three-way center-to-left coalition with the Greens - has 9 percent. The Greens hold 8 percent, according to the poll."

Yet Angela Merkel’s political longevity is based on keeping voters at home happy. She will illustrate that today in a speech to a chamber of commerce in Greifswald, her north-eastern constituency on the Baltic Sea. Expect Mrs Merkel to hail Germany’s booming economy and low unemployment rate, without broaching controversial themes such as reform of the euro zone or tax cuts. Opinion polls give her Christian Democrat alliance, the CDU/CSU, a lead of ten-plus points over the centre-left SPD. This political pre-eminence comes from saying lots but revealing little; it will be the same story today. Her foreign fans may yearn for great deeds; they should stay calm [The Economist Espresso]"

She has reforged links with the Bavarian CSU affiliate of her CDU party, and has more or less eclipsed her principal domestic rival for the Chancellorship, Schulz. The worldview that she expresses seems to be very in tune with broad German public opinion too. The thinness of this outlook will wear out eventually, and the delusions it encompasses will become more evident in time, but before the elections? Unless there is an unusually horrific Islamist attack or series of attacks, particularly committed by post-2015 immigrants (and not necessarily so should this come about), this would seem extremely unlikely. Trump's irresponsibility and inadequacy is, moreover, Merkel's greatest ally."

To date, the best way to have an eye on the public opinion seems to be poll aggregating making probabilistic judgments on who would win. Two such instruments are available: - https://www.inwt-statistics.de/blog-artikel-lesen/wahlprognose-fuer-die-bundestagswahl-2017.html#Prognose (German) - http://www.thecrosstab.com/germany-2017/ (English) - Raw data is provided here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_German_federal_election,_2017 The German page by INWT Statistics is also modeling the probability that Merkel can stay German Chancellor: to date this is 84,5 per cent. However there are some arguments this could be too high and some that this could be too low. 84,5 per cent is too low: - The poll aggregators model a red-red-green coalition (SPD-LEFT-Greens) as more likely than a Grand Coalition of CDU und SPD, if both were possible. This is a strong assumption since – first – voters do not prefer the red-red-green coalition and both, SPD and the LEFT, have a very considerable disagreement among leaders and rank-and-file to go ahead with such a coalition. If possible, I would say that the chances are – at best – 50 percent for this coalition to be formed. Schultz clearly signals to voters that he does not want form a coalition with the LEFT in the first place. - Given the fact that the SPD has to make a statement on coalition options and given the clear impression from several regional elections that red-red-green coalition is not preferred by the voters, it seems likely that this route to the Chancellorship is completely down for Martin Schulz, the candidate for Chancellorship of the SPD. The only route that he then has is a coalition with the Liberals and the Greens. But: If this kind of a ‘traffic light coalition’ would be possible and given that the CDU would have the biggest seat share (very, very likely: 99 percent) a CDU-Liberal-Green coalition would be possible, either. The Liberals and the Greens would be in the position to decide which side they would join and which of the candidates would become German Chancellor. Greens tend to the SPD camp, Liberals tend to the CDU camp. That would very likely end up in a stalemate. Consequence: Grand Coalition, Chancellor: Merkel. - Given the enormous success of the Liberals in the regional elections in North Rhine Westphalia (12+ percent), it could become more likely than pollsters currently measure that a CDU-Liberal government could be formed (if so, with a very tiny majority). So it seems that Merkel will have another realistic option to stay Chancellor – beside the Grand Coalition. - Merkel is probably least prone to political scandals among the Western leaders and candidates. A Fillon-like scandal in Germany seems very unlikely, but Merkel not even had to witness a scandal like some of her Cabinet members that – nevertheless – would not lead to their resignation. And this holds true if one looks back all the years she is in German politics. That makes her approval ratings and her electoral performance a reliable factor to count on. - Schulz and the SPD lack the magic triangle: a harmonizing combination of (1) Candidate, (2) an issue that voters have an interest in and (3) a favorable media agenda. However, 84,5 per cent could be too high: - There is so much time until elections take place… Many things can happen. Merkel almost lost safe elections in 2005 against the – incumbent – Gerhard Schröder. Scandals among rank-and-file are always possible, particularly in the CDU – even if they seem to be harmless in international perspective. - It is very likely that the current offspring of the CDU and Liberal polls will normalize a bit an SPD will gain momentum. Too, it is likely that Schulz will find an issue and – may be, may be – media agenda will support him (most journalist in Germany lean toward the left side of the political spectrum). - It would be very awkward for Merkel and the CDU if there would be a terrorist attack with an Islamic background or something similar: a series of violent crimes with nationwide media coverage committed by refugees or other foreigners (because people blame Merkel personally for the refugee inflow in 2015; and national security and law-and-order is a unique selling point of the CDU). If refugee crisis would rebound it would be disastrous for the CDU. However, it is kind of the absurd situation in Germany in the Merkel era that such events would not be to the advantage of the SPD; rather, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) would profit from such events. – Even under these very unfavorable circumstances for the CDU: the Chancellor is very likely to stay Merkel! All in all, it seems to date, that Merkel is fairly well ‘priced’ with 88 to 90 percent probability to stay Chancellor of Germany after the next parliamentary elections."

This might be necessary if CDS/CSU/FD do not have a majority (and neither do the red-red-green coalition, owing to the presence of Alternative for Deutschland). At this point, Shulz can't say no."

Pre-vote the polls had the CDU and SPD very close while the exit polls have the CDU 4% ahead. Assuming the exit polls are accurate could suggest that the pre-election polls are under estimating support for the CDU and over estimating support for the SPD. As the CDU is already ahead in the national polls if these are underestimating CDU votes then Merkel would seem to be well ahead nationally. Its also interesting that the Free Democrats seem to be recovering, while the Greens have lost votes. This probably makes it easier for the CDU to put together a national coalition and the harder for the SPD to do so, in the national elections. I am not sure if there are any special local circumstances that would stop this state election being a useful national indicator(?) It is tempting to forget that getting the most votes does not necessarily give a party the Chancellorship, there is still be business of creating the coalition."

Usually, they vote according to party affiliation. Now, people might think that it's really a close race between CDU and SPD. However, that's where you would be mistaken, since the members of the Bundestag are decided by districts, (similar to the US's states electing the president).

Also, the refugee crisis had weakened Merkel, but it seems there is no good alternative. Still, probability remains, that SPD, Linke, Green, FDP and AFD will attain a theoretical majority of minimum 51% of the seats in Bundestag. However, chances are slim, that any established party would cooperate with AFD - Alternative for Germany - which is tainted nationalistic by the established parties and main stream media. The allegations are mostly unreasonable, but the media in Germany is also under influence by the US Pentagon-Financial oligarchs circles, and they want to continue the given geopolitical direction towards world hegemony. The Russian-Ukraine conflict on the one hand, and the Rassia-NATO opposition is being viewed in Germany skeptically as well. But thanks to rational course of the Russian president Putin in all spheres, internally as well externally, the general public in Germany trusts Russia to be strong enough to hold off NATO aggression in Europe and else where, on the one hand, and to show sufficient historical wisdom and patients till the US administration will calm down their desire to become the uncontested hegemonic world leader due to the changing world constellation. Therefore most probably Merkels party CDU will receive more votes then the rest and will cooperate accordingly with the SPD, possibly FPD and Green party to form a coalition of minimum 51% and will therefore lead the new government once again, since 2005."

Both parties share roughly the same attitude towards Europe and the Euro, compared at least to the AFD. At the core though, Germans are very conservative especially in times of uncertainty, and so a consolidation around Merkel should happen well in advance of the polls. In addition, Schultz has a more dovish approach to Greece and has spoken out against austerity, which doesn't sit well with Germans, especially with German inflation already pushing past 2 % and concern mounting over the accommodating monetary policy of the ECB. The post-wars inflation experience remains tightly imprinted in the German collective memory."

Spiegel article indicates that support within her party is tepid. The SPD changed leadership to Martin Schulz who is generating enthusiasm. Polls show that he and Merkel are tied with voters who are ""satisfied or very satisfied"" with them but Schulz has a greater upside with only a 17% dis-satisfaction compared to Merkel's 44% and a much higher percentage of those who don't know, 24% to 1%. Merkel is at the limit of her support, ala Hillary Clinton, and Schulz is not. She also continues to follow a flawed refugee policy that could easily blow up on her. She is probably still the slight favorite by virtue of incumbency, but she definitely has a problem."

No matter what happens in the world outside — Donald Trump’s election, Brexit, refugee crisis, the troubles of the E.U. — the voters show little desire for change. Merkel’s Christian Democrats poll between 30 percent and 35 percent; the Social Democrats between 20 percent and 25 percent; the Greens, the Left, and the Alternative for Germany each between 10 percent and 15 percent; and the Liberals just barely over 5 percent.

It could simply be a polling anomaly. Its difficult to see how either the SPD or CDU could not be part of the next government, so its likely that they will (again) be together in a coalition. Presumably the Chancellorship would go to the leader of the party in the coalition with the most seats, but if a third party joined the coalition maybe that would upset this. So for now Merkel is my favorite but the election is still a long time off."

His advantage, as former president of the European Parliament, is that his views on domestic issues are little known, making him difficult to attack. This only adds to the suspense over his strategy, which he will unveil at the party gathering in Berlin, for challenging Angela Merkel, the incumbent. A new poll shows them tied in popularity at 41% each. But the excitement is unlikely to last. Germans don’t elect the chancellor directly.

I believe that remembrance of the Nazi era is more poignant in Germany than elsewhere and the far-right identity politics of the AfD will not be as effective as in say France or Britain, especially as recent leaks indicate a more rightist tack in Merkel's campaign.

I am assuming that the AfG would not be welcome in a coalition (too far to the right). The FDP might not get enough votes to get any seats. So that really only leaves the Greens and Left as potential coalition partners for the CDU/CSU or the SDP. Many Germans might want a change of government, but unless they are of the far right or far left the choice seems to be the centre left or centre right and then a repeat of the existing coalition.
