From the Economist: “The latest oil outlook published by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries does not make for cheery reading. The group lowered its forecast for oil demand as fears mount that a recession will reduce the need for it. That comes as OPEC has struggled to maintain a high oil price. In December last year OPEC and its allies, as well as Russia, agreed to cut output by 1.2m barrels a day to support the price of crude. Yet prices have slumped from almost $75 in April to around $60. A drone attack in September on Saudi Arabia’s biggest processing facility pushed prices up, but only temporarily. Little wonder that OPEC’s chief, Mohammad Barkindo, said in October that the club and its allies may consider deeper cuts to oil production when they meet in Vienna in December. After his comments, oil prices ticked up. However, much depends on the outcome of trade talks between China and America.”"
