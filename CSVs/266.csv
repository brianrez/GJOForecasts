My cynical side agrees with him: ""A final word about Ukraine: It will likely cease to exist as an independent entity. Putin and other Russians have long insisted it is not a nation at all; it is part of Russia. Setting history and sentiment aside, it would be bad strategy for Putin to allow Ukraine to continue to exist as a nation after all the trouble and expense of an invasion. That is a recipe for endless conflict. After Russia installs a government, expect Ukraine’s new Moscow-directed rulers to seek the eventual legal incorporation of Ukraine into Russia, a process already underway in Belarus.""

With all those troops poised to further invade, the West may hold out on additional sanctions that they would have otherwise applied to the smaller-scale incursion. There are other potential explanations, but rather than enumerating them here, I'll just say that I think the most likely scenario is that my initial read on the situation was wrong and a larger-scale invasion is likely to unfold shortly."

Incursions further into Ukraine would likely precipitate even more severe sanctions and an all-out shooting war. I'm skeptical Putin wants that type of escalation. This will be seen as a huge policy mistake in future decades by NATO / US - they could have used Donetsk as a wedge between the Russia / China alliance (by recognizing Donetsk's rights to self-determination). As an aside, Russia / China are natural rivals (large unguardable border, russia has excess resources, china has excess people) - if Russia joined NATO, it would really hurt China. Lots of missed opportunities because NATO / US are still stuck in cold war thinking."

Putin appears aged and his Security Council meeting is even more alarming. He throttled Mishustin and the participants unease was obvious Putin has already invaded Ukraine. Sanctions or the threat of Sanctions haven't deterred Putin. The certainty that he has invaded Lukhansk and Donestk is matched by the certainty that he aims for the complete and total destruction of the Ukrainian state by hybrid means and actual war. It is hard to critique NATO and EU leadership. One wonders if even the threat of massive Sanctions will deter Putin. And the argument that NATO expansion in the 1990s is responsible is misguided. Without it Russian troops would be at Poland and Baltic state borders with no Article V obligation to defend All the West and the world can do is grieve for the Ukrainian and Russian peoples, provide all means necessary to aid Ukraine and redouble the NATO and EU efforts to enhance collective security with acts not words. Any negotiation with Putin is futile and we reached again the same point George Kennan made in his famous X telegram. The only way forward is containment of Putin and imposing such massive costs that neither he nor Xi will benefit from naked unprovoked aggression. It is going to be a long and constant struggle In time the West will win Again if leadership and peoples Remain committed to democracy and freedom.

I believe they make an exception for the Baltics due to their small size but will not make an exception for Ukraine, which they view as their near-abroad: NATO buffer territory and central to Black Sea control. However their recent history shows an aversion to ops with significant casualties or significant economic/political costs. Since the US & EU will likely make it costly for Russia, I believe that when the invasion is launched it will quickly take one of 2 paths: control the important border oblasts and withdraw or install another regime in Kyiv and withdraw. My 30% for No means there's a chance Zelensky will agree to Putin's terms in that Ukraine will agree to remain neutral and not join NATO."

Meanwhile Putin continues to turn up the heat incrementally using the full spectrum of coercive techniques even assassination of Ukraine leadership. Now in totality Putin has blockaded Ukraine by land and by sea and psychologically by raw terror of an imminent invasion. No country no modern nation state can survive this blockade as it extends into weeks. If Ukraine is truly a turning point like Munich in 1938 then US NATO and EU need to take concrete steps to turn up their own asymmetric efforts. Lights out in Minsk and Rostov would demonstrate to Putin that everything other than ground troops like cyber attacks our own sponsored false flag attacks targeted assassinations are on the table. Otherwise Putin wins even if no Invasion. Russian troops remain in Belarus. Breaches of the Minsk cease fire continue. Russia continues it air and naval blockade. Until NATO dispatches a significant force to the Baltic and Black Sea ports and moves significant air forces and further deploys troops in Rumania and Poland Putin will dial up the pressures. A blockade is an act of war. While amplifying force to counter Putin risks World War Iii failure to support and sustain Ukraine will result in defeat without a battle. No good choices here but allowing a de facto blockade of Ukraine is a choice. US and allies continued freedom of navigation exercises in South China Sea and Taiwan Straits are provocative but necessary. Not engaging in freedom of Navigation exercises in Black Sea and Baltic concedes a principle the United States navy has demonstrated since 1797. There can be little doubt that once Ukraine is bent to the will of Putin that Taiwan is next. The rise of ethno nationalism in US and Russia and PRC threatens the whole post WWII order and suggests that by 2024 the US and Russia could both be unequivocal fascist Dictatorships with their own dominant ideology of protecting whites or Russians or the French from cultural if not physical genocide. 2022 is but the opening act and NATO and EU should consider Ukraine and Taiwan existential issues that involve critical security issues. As far as negotiations..yes they will continue but anything other than reciprocal demobilization and removal of Russia blockade of Ukraine is a defeat.

Russia has amassed a fortune from oil and gas and other projects; Russia is the 5th largest economy in Europe and the 11th largest in the world. And it has modernized its military. Putin has dreamed for decades of restoring Russian power. The Cold War may have ended, but it got replaced with a new rivalry with Russia, and Putin seems determined to increase Russian power in Europe. They have laid the groundwork for years: conducting massive disinformation campaigns to weaken the West; building one of the world's top offensive and defensive cyber capabilities; building a very modern military, including modern EW capabilities, anti-satellite capabilities, hypersonic missiles and drones (although they're perhaps a bit behind in UAV capabilities); hanging out around undersea cables all around the world, probably mapping them out and developing plans for cutting them in different war-gaming scenarios; practicing building up the military around Ukraine in preparation for a real invasion (so much so that many seem to be used to the idea of Russian troops around Ukraine, view it as a policy tool, and do not think invasion is likely); and the list goes on and on."

News from international diplomacy show no substancial sign of deescalation from the Russian side while the Ukrainian government is calming down it's official communication. The reason, I think, for the Ukrainians tuning down is, that Russia is likely constructing a casus belli (not unprecedented for Russia) and Ukraine doesn't want to play into it retorically. Also that the US government urges Americans to leave Ukraine and is publicly thinking how to get and how not to get it's citizens out in case of a confrontation plus the deployments of US troops to Eastern and Middle European Nato member states, all this is at least troublesome developments.

It would be violent. Putin seems to probably underestimate the casualties Russia would incur. I would love to know what he and Xi discussed behind closed doors. However, I don't believe it's in China's interest for a full scale world war to break out and my hunch is Xi gave Putin his support but also firmly nudged him away from anything too crazy. China is more risk averse than Russia as far as I see it. On the other hand, the two partners may feel emboldened and may have a sense of entitlement that blinds them to the downside risks of conflict. They may think that conflict would go there way and perhaps their generals are all too eager to tell them that they are prepared for anything. In that case then conflict is more likely. I've become more bearish on peace over the last 24 hours."

The plan builds on the recent disinformation barrage by Moscow accusing Ukrainians of genocide. While the planned video—using real corpses, actors as mourners, faked Ukrainian military equipment—sounds crazy, American officials think it might have worked. And they hope blowing the whistle will stop the plan in its tracks. Russia, the officials said, intended to use the video to accuse Ukraine of “genocide” against Russian-speaking people. It would then use the report to justify an attack or have separatist leaders in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine invite a Russian intervention. Officials would not release any direct evidence of the Russian plan or how they learned of it, saying to do so would compromise their sources and methods. But both the recent disinformation campaign focused on false accusations of genocide and recent the political actions being taken in the Russian parliament lend credence to the intelligence. Avril D. Haines, the director of National Intelligence, and other top administration officials briefed members of Congress on the material on Thursday. Details of the information have also been shared with allies, as the United States and Britain push a kind of intel diplomacy. A British government official said that they had done their own analysis on the intelligence and had high confidence that Russia was planning to engineer a pretext to blame Ukraine for an attack. The details are “credible and extremely concerning,” the official said."" With link to NYT article: https://twitter.com/julianbarnes/status/1489277083415154688"

I think the threat of sanctions against some of the oligarchs supporting Putin could create enough headaches to make the expected cost of the invasion higher than the expected benefit from Putin's point of view. Maybe it's worth having troops at the ready in case a golden opportunity to invade presents itself (e.g. some unexpected chaos in Europe). Meanwhile, Russia's military buildup along the border could potentially lead to concessions from the West (e.g. an agreement not to allow Ukraine to join NATO for 15 years or something like that). I also think Putin's relative advantage is diminishing by the day. Each day, NATO has more time to prepare additional counter-measures and warmer weather draws nearer meaning that Russia won't have as much leverage with respect to Europe's need for its natural gas imports. From where things stand today, I suspect that it's more likely that there is no invasion, but, if there is, I suspect that it will be shortly after Putin gets back from the Olympics as noted in @belikewater 's comments (due to relations with China). If an attack doesn't happen by mid-February, I'm going to start lowering on the chances of invasion rather quickly as warmer weather approaches."

There is popular discontent in Russia and Belarus over the ruling party a war will allow implementation of extra laws that would allow silencing discontent much easier in both countries. China has stakes in the north of Russia so they have an interest in weakening Russia through this war and might provide further incentives and securities to Russia that can encourage them. It's in Belarus' interest to weaken Russia when it broke ties with Europe. Belarus will have more leverage dealing with weakened Russia. USA has an interest in this war as well because of internal unrest. This war might provide necessary economic push and divert the population from what's going inside. It might as well help invest more into US infrastructure since after the war with Russia some percentage of it is going to be destroyed as a result of cyberwarfare.

I'm convinced Putin thinks the west is weak and not a genuine military threat to Russia. The real threat of the west comes from its soft power, and the attraction it may hold to Russian citizens to demand a different kind of society. This threatens his regime and his personal personal safety, and his own vision for Russia. If Ukraine really becomes part of the West and a democratic and prosperous society, it will cripple the foundations of Putin's regime and his legacy. I believe Putin seeks to prevent a successful Ukraine either by destabilizing it, ruining its economy or invasion and occupation of all or parts of it. + Russia is making all the preparation you'd expect for invasion + Russia has made completely unrealistic demands on the USA and NATO, which indicates a desire for war or unrealistic Russian expectations. Which make war and invasion more likely. + Ukraine is getting stronger and the best moment to strike might be now. + Russia can afford it to ride out the sanctions + invasion might be the one sure move Putin can make to ensure Ukraine does not prosper. I'm going with the baseline of that Russia will invade."

I credit Blinken with rescuing Biden from his ill timed comments and his marshaling NATO with Jen Stoltenberg including German new government. Of course there is ongoing disagreement about what sanctions to impose based on hypothetical events among the allies. But NATO stayed unified on the basic point no more invasions ever in a Europe that is to be whole and free. But at some point that Europe needs to include Ukraine and Russia. That's a 10 year project that has a lot more benefits to Russia than physical occupation of any part of Ukraine

The question isn't focused on the magnitude of an invasion, but rather will there be an **accusation** of an invasion from particular sources. An invasion by the Russian military would be crossing the border into Ukraine w/o authorization from the government of Ukraine. This need not be large scale. Also, there are reports of a potential false flag operation to be carried out by Russian special forces inside Ukraine. If those reports are accurate, then it seems like a high probability that NATO or a NATO member will accuse Russian military forces of invading Ukraine. Even if the special forces are not marked as Russian military forces, the accusation can still be made."

Ukrainians need to survive the initial assault and then they can roll out to engage because it will take more than a day for Russia to replenish from the first fusillade. Because of differences in rail gauges Russia is dependent on truck transport to resupply a force so large it moved there by rail. Casualties could run in the tens of thousands. Demographics works against replacing those soldiers with young men. It could effect their defensive posture for years to come. 1st reports coming in suggest the reserves have been mustered at rail heads and some will man home units and some will go straight to the Western front. In the aftermath of the little green men caper where they stole back Crimea, it was not necessary to come in as the Russian Army, they simply let the militias be their face and supported them in the conflict with advisors and material. Now they control New Russia or the Donbas region. This suggests to me that Russia will stake its prestige on either a total NATO back down OR THEY SEIZE SOME STRATEGIC SLICES TO ACHIEVE THEIR AIMS AND SEND A MESSAGE TO OTHER POTENTIAL nato NEWBIES. In related matters over two dozen LNG tankers are enroute to the EU. I think they are stockpiling against a total Russian Gas cut off. And the EU is shipping ultra low sulpher Diesel to the US for heating fuel use. Somehow we have a shortage of on hand heating oil and Truck Fuel? In short their (Russian) prestige requires a victory of some type that will allow them to exploit the greater region."

Integrating Crimea into Russia was expensive, and Putin is only likely to want to take on those and other costs in an extreme situation. Russia is likely to continue supporting insurgents in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, and may well work to spread the chaos further into Ukraine with or without military forces, but likely only with plausible deniability, which would probably temper NATO's response. The bloc itself seems particularly unlikely to respond forcefully, although a skittish member-state in the Baltics could potentially say something if they fear an invasion of their territory as well. Hence a small percentage dedicated to the possibility that something goes beyond those two oblasts. But I'd say there's very little likelihood of a NATO member-state just now accusing Russia of something they've been doing since 2014. That looks bad."

Following the US withdraw from Afghanistan there is an expectation that the US is reticent to commit full military support in response to Russia's thresh hold activities, particularly in Ukraine. A direct accusation of invasion by the US removes its ability to remain strategically ambiguous in this scenario (as it does for any NATO member, or the body as a whole).

Say one targeted assassination of field level security forces in Belarus for each dissident jailed in Lukashenko jails and one targeted assassination for each Kz dissident jailed in Almaty and Putin will start experiencing hybrid wars in the near abroad he now thinks he controls.

While a Russian invasion is possible, if you assume a renaissance of US-Russia detente (US is attempting to cooperate with Moscow on Cyber), military posturing without an invasion could achieve NATO distancing in Ukraine (Western concession) in exchange for cooperation on something like new START (Moscow concession). In the meantime, I wouldn't be surprised if Russia continues to build pressure in an attempt to destabilize Ukraine (indicators -> grey space operations) if diplomatic engagements fail mid-year. Accusations or false flags could certainly skew my forecast as result."

""Russia has forward-deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and even short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine’s borders. US intelligence has said Russia could launch an offensive by the end of January with as many as 100 battalion tactical groups (BTGs), comprising an estimated 175,000 troops. Current estimates say Russia has about 50 BTGs in the border region, already a significant force that could overrun Ukrainian defensive positions. Russia’s rhetoric has grown more belligerent. Vladimir Putin has demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine will never join NATO or host its missile strike systems, concessions he is not likely to receive. He is also short on time. His troops cannot remain out of garrison indefinitely. By late winter he will probably have to launch an attack or draw down his forces in what would look like a retreat."" (The Guardian)"

Putin will not chance any real possibility of Ukraine becoming the next Afghanistan for Russia and losing prestige and power. Why would Russia want to occupy Ukraine a military and financial money loser when the IMF has the unenviable task of subsidizing Ukraine and its corrupt political and financial system. Better to use Primakov Gerasimov hybrid war techniques, deny Ukraine gas and transit revenues,destabilize by threats of invasions with the very real possibility Ukraine like a rotten apple will just fall into Russian sphere of influence"

The cost of invasion are high (some mentioned bellow) but more specifically it won't be like 2014 anymore (almost no bloodshed, and complete denial of no Russian casualty). If invasion happens, then there will be casualties from Russia, coupled with heavier sanctions and increasing military aids to Ukraine, and not to mention that countries like Poland may (and will) get closer to the West, I'm not sure what Putin is thinking at the moment."
