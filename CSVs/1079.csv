Mississippi's constitution has Jim Crow-era provision that ""statewide officers must win a majority of the popular vote and a majority of the 122 districts comprising the state’s House of Representatives. If no one wins a double-majority, the House may choose the governor."" [1] I have thus assigned most of the ~15% chance that I give to a Hood popular vote victory to the ""none of the above"" option in which Hood wins the popular vote but Reeves is selected by the Republican majority in the House. I have increased this probability because, according to The Economist article, Tate Reeves has ""refused to rule out letting the House decide.""

And finally, as others have pointed out, Mississippi is one of the most inelastic states in the country - meaning that we should take this base rate even more seriously."
