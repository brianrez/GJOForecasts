Therefore most changes resulting from back to school (such as more testing or more cases) have already been seen, but we'll see some small additional increases. * Vaccinations will continue to increase at a low rate, won't have a significant impact. Booster shots might start in late September, but since it takes about 7 days to have an impact, they will also have a minimal impact at reducing cases. * The weather won't be too cold until mid October, so no increases due to winter. * The number of cases reported depends on the number of cases and the number of tests. * The real number of cases has likely peaked. It is likely to start going down. I don't yet have high confidence on this. * The number of tests might go up a bit due to school starts, and then probably stay flat or go down as cases stabilize / go down. * There are no holidays that will have an artificial impact (less testing) * Therefore: - Bin 1 is very unlikely - Bin 2 is not too likely, but might happen if the numbers haven't yet peaked. Need to track over the next few days. - Bin 3 is unlikely. - Bin 4 is the most likely"

MA has a relatively high proportion of fully vaccinated people (>67% overall), and the younger age groups (12-29yrs) average 68-71% for the first dose. However, Hampden and Bristol counties, which have some of the higher levels of cases, also have the lowest levels of vaccination, which suggests there is still scope for further transmission. Daily testing rates and positivity levels are fairly flat, but with schools and higher education open I think there could be slightly more testing over the next weeks, which could lead to flat or marginally increasing cases being recorded, before a decline starts to trend. So bin1 is almost ruled out; if case av. falls that low, it's unlikely to be reversed over the term Bin2: I can't rule this out; Delta could still spread through younger groups, and the control week included a day with almost no cases recorded Bin3: I think it would take a few weeks to hit 28.5 and that would signal that transmission is persisting, so this looks unlikely Bin4: this looks the most likely with rising vaccination rates in younger ages, mask mandates, a plateauing chart. I'll go for a gradual rise for a few weeks, followed by a decline into October."
