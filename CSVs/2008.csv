I recall in BIG that they came up with transformers into buildings, rubbish then and not innovative now. Apparently doesn't even float. I loom on ipad. Please no more bracelets. Lazer maze seems clever puzzle. Dima-K tells me it was nominated last year and maybe they want it to win, but just think there's more innovative games in the list. Makey makey has rave reviews on amazon and innovative is a word used throughout and for all age ranges and all sixes. Meccanoid. Well I'm 2 hours into the 7 hour build with my eldest daughter. It's a robot, could but didn't think it was innovative when I bought it. MiP per Dima-K again. Jedi is definitely innovative I can't remember a toy like it that didn't have strings!. But doesn't seem to have rave reviews and leaves people a little disappointed. The price of innovation maybe. Relying on the split of praedico that retailera bloggers and journalist weight will give it to makey makey and fact it was crowd sourced gives it support in some way missing from others. Anyway. That's my best guess gotta get back to that robot...."

Laser Maze Jr was a nominee last year - strike that one off, too. Nothing is innovative about Sandy's House & Ocean Cruiser and in any case the ""innovative"" effectively means boy toy because I am pretty sure it's mostly men voting. Still, i-loom sounds like a decent time-waste that has an advantage of being coupled to the referees' favorite signaling product. Makey Makey Classic and Meccanoid G15 sound fairly innovative in a sense that they are good electronic upgrades of ~100 years old favorites. Jedi Force Levitator sounds pedestrian but I'll give it a good chance for the whole Star Wars mania that likely afflicts referees."
