There appear to be around 350,000 barrel per day remaining that have not been released fro this voluntary cut. 3. If OPEC+ increases production by 400,000 per month starting in July, and KSA is ~33% of OPEC+ production, that would mean an increase of 133,000 barrel per day. 4.

That said, historically the average has been -275 from their quota (minus their excess months), so that may be because their 1M cut was voluntary and less strict, and they have been playing the role of quota enforcer within OPEC, so the gap between quota and production will probably be larger in the future. Still though, they're dramatically scaling up production and planning to increase in August, and an overage of 5 tb/d isn't something other members would harp on them for."

Furthermore, SA is supposed to add an extra 350K in June and 400K in July. That would make it total of 1541K addition by end of July. Hence, it's expected to have about 10 million b/d for SA.

These were lowered for COVID by 9.7M total May-July, 7.7 August-December, and 7.2 since January. Saudi Arabia also did additional cuts of 1M in February-April to prop up prices and as a goodwill gesture to other OPEC members (according to them), so their quota is lower than normal and their actual production is 1M below their quota. Their current quota is 9.12M, their April production was 8.132. As of the last OPEC meeting, they're planning to phase out their 1M voluntary cut over the next 3 months (https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/051021-opec-crude-oil-production-rises-in-april-on-surges-from-iran-russia-platts-survey).

This useful chart [2] shows Saudi Arabia's historical production, and shows that they've voluntarily cut by about 1,000. Because it's voluntary I think they're less likely to continue with it by July, and they've indicated they intend to end the cut by July. I'm putting most weight on bucket 4, which is just under their announced quota. As the largest producing member of OPEC I think Saudi Arabia has the most incentive to abide by the quota, which is a maximum allowed if I'm understanding it correctly. But I'm leaving about a 1 in 5 chance in over 9,500 in the event that the quotas get revised up or they overshoot. I'm also leaving a little under 1 in 5 chance that they maintain their voluntary reduction. I think chances are pretty slim that they fall in the 8.5 to 9 category, I would guess by July they'll either stick to their 1 million barrel a day reduction or have eliminated it as opposed to being in the middle of phasing it out."

Thus, the exact outcome will depend on a couple of factors: /the recovery of global economic activity, particularly in oil-importing nations, and thus overall demand /global travel /U.S. national crude oil stocks /OPEC+ quota discipline, and quota amendments before June 2021 due to changes in demand outlook (external shocks, the global COVID-19 pandemic situation) /revival of the Russia - Saudi Arabia ""oil market war"", which is a battle for market share in the first place, and would see Saudi Arabia increasing output volume and thus lowering average prices realized for the cartel as a whole. As the government of KSA plans to enable their budget to become more independent of Saudi Aramco's dividend payments in the future and to increase the assets under management held by their sovereign wealth funds significantly by 2025 by budget cuts in the near term, it seems these are precautions taken for more resilience against the impact of financial fallout in a next round of the race for market dominance against Russia. /Industrialized importing nations, who tended to deplete their strategic stockpiles over the past 14 months of ready supply at low prices, could be forced to refill stores amid strong global economic growth perspectives and sticky oil prices around 60USD/bbl. Hedging demand by air carriers could pick up due to increased demand for transportation of cargo and passengers. Both would likely drive OPEC+ output volumes as well as prices at least temporarily. /This would mean the question resolves on the 5th bin, if KSA's production only marginally exceeds their currently planned quota by more than 5tb/d, or 0.063%, in July 2021, which is peak tavel season (peak fuel demand in the Northern hemisphere)."
