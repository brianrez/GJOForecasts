A series of surveys conducted by different companies using different samples have put him on around 48% of the vote, with Odinga on around 43%. These polls suggest that about 8% of Kenyans remain undecided. This suggests that Odinga can still win, but to do so he will have to capture the vast majority of “floating voters” in the last month of campaigning."

I am not sure how things will built up if NASA won. Who will take which seat? The election is already complicated and people would vote for stability and he will win. But I do not underestimate the votes for NASA as there were stories of corruption in the papers. So I say 75% YES

This means that Odinga still has a chance, but in order to win he will have to run up the numbers in his strongholds, while at the same time getting more of his voters to the polls. Given the 2017 registration numbers, and if the turnout and vote share patterns witnessed in 2013 were to hold this year, then Kenyatta would still win with 8,000,936 votes (51.5%) against Odinga’s 7,392,439 votes (47.6%). https://kenopalo.com/2017/05/26/by-the-numbers-a-look-at-the-2017-presidential-election-in-kenya/"
