Some of its cutters loom over the biggest warships in rival Asian navies. Today a public consultation closes about a new law that would beef it up further. The proposed legislation would allow the coastguard to demolish buildings on Chinese-claimed reefs, board and expel foreign vessels and use armed force to do so. The provisions of the draft law are not unusual by international standards. More worrying is that they cover the vast swathe of ocean that China claims throughout the South China Sea, an area that has fizzed with tension over the past decade. China has used its coastguard not only for routine law enforcement, like catching smugglers, but also to project power in the South and East China Seas. Earlier this year Vietnam accused a Chinese coastguard vessel of ramming and sinking one of its fishing vessels. Such confrontations could get more fraught.“"

The PLA's aggressive ADIZ stance allows frequent oversight of SCS surface and subsurface lanes with intelligence aircraft and an extension would give the PLA the distance they need to set the conditions for conflict with Taiwan, if needed. Woody Island, Fiery Cross Reef, Subi Reef, and Mischief Reef have high-frequency radar stations on these islands and would be further supported by an ADIZ. Despite recent news of US arms sales to Taiwan, China may view the current domestic context in the US as a perfect opportunity to expand for their One China Policy.

Though China may now have a decent infrastructure in place to enforce such a claim in the SCS, the move would risk higher regional instability and angered neighbors. Such a rise in the risk of conflict would likely only be rationalized as a response to a larger threat. However, the recent Diplomat article offers compelling evidence that China may be closer to establishing a more limited ADIZ close to Taiwan.

PRC state-run media declared intent to establish these in ECS and SCS back in 2008. Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense (MND) reported on 4 May 2020 that China was planning to set up an ADIZ in the SCS. The CCP cannot back down on its territorial claims in the SCS without catastrophically losing legitimacy with domestic audiences. It has backed itself into a corner with its territorial claims. Enforcing an ADIZ in this area is operationally paramount to asserting these claims.
96796,2020-11-13T03:35:28Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"As US support for Taiwan increases, as seen in the sale of MQ-9B, China will be driven to assert more force in the area. One way to do this is to establish and ADIZ in the South China Sea. While I believe at some point China will establish an ADIZ in the area, I need to look at the chance they would prior to 1 March 2021. China has typically been instigated by US ships in the area and have responded to other international disagreements with an increase in activity in the South China Sea. I see the biggest factor in determining the timing is the changeover of US leadership in January. China is not in a strategic rush to implement an ADIZ, so they will wait until it’s necessary to assert dominance. So as not to instigate unrest with a new president, I think it is unlikely they will assert an ADIZ over any part of the SCS prior to 1 March 2021."

I believe the likelihood they will establish another one before March is largely dependent on who wins the 2020 US Presidential race. If President Trump wins, China is likely less inclined to alter the relationship in a negative way. If former VP Biden wins, China could use this tactic as an early test of the potential new Administration’s stance and approach on the region."

I'm definitely projecting here, but if I were China I would set it up when I expected to be able to enforce it without inciting a crisis and/or when I could use it as a bargaining tool in some way. The country most likely to interfere with China's ability to enforce the ADIZ, either directly or indirectly, is the U.S. The most pertinent event to this question from the U.S. side between now and March is the change (probably) of administrations. If I'm China I'm probably not going to gamble on a Trump administration response but I might want to make this an opening gambit in my relationship with a Biden administration.

Additionally, the circumstances of that event are very different. However, information from the ECS ADIZ declaration can aid as a potential indicator of China actions. The ECS ADIZ caused a lot of angst for all parties, China included. Although China might be consider themselves as overall successful in establishing the ECS ADIZ, they were not initially prepared to enforce the ADIZ. Therefore, China may not establish a SCS ADIZ until they are feel prepared to enforce. PRC messaging indicates that there may be plans already developed to eventually declare an ADIZ over parts of the SCS, when they are prepared. It is difficult to determine what level of preparedness China requires prior to establishing the SCS ADIZ. Perhaps, they are already prepared and are waiting for the appropriate time to make an announcement. They do have multiple air bases established in the SCS with defensive systems, therefore, it seems logical to suggest that they may be close to readiness level necessary to enforce an ADIZ. The ECS ADIZ was announced in November of 2013 and overlaps other countries ADIZs. Any extension of the ECS ADIZ or the declaration of new ADIZ will cause significant international attention."

The PRC also seems inclined to make declarations when overtly threatened by the US or another nation. This seems less likely given the US election result and Chinese officials statements vis-a-vis a Biden vs Trump administration. I suspect that Xi Jinping's administration will wait to see what the Biden administration's policy in regard to China are before taking proactive actions like declaring an ADIZ (this would only be 40 days into a new presidency). The PRC's foreign minister greeted the election result positively. Much of the antagonism that has driven Chinese declarations in the South China Sea has been related to US Naval Patrols, which seem unlikely in the current environment in the US after the firing of the Defense Secretary and during a probable election transition. The PRC has only declared a single ADIZ since its inception over the East China Sea in 2013. This is such a rare event that a frequentist model is useless. The PRC officially holds that the South China Sea islands are the sovereign territory of China much as was claimed about the East China Sea islands. Both claims have been met with skepticism internationally. Conversely, if another rare event were to occur like a Trump surprise victory in the US election then this would increase the likelihood of this event as the PRC sees Trump's position as more clearly anti-PRC and the chaos in the US from a highly contested election would give the PRC more room to maneuver internationally to avoid sanctions from such a declaration. Thus, without a party platform for this announcement, without an overt international reason driving its immediacy, lacking overt antagonism by its main rival, but with the possibility for a rare event to destabilize this situation I would estimate a probability of around 20.0% per year. Given that the portion of the year subtended in the question period is 29.86%, I would estimate a 5.97% probability of this occurring."

Currently, shoals, reefs, and man-made islands in the South China Sea fail to meet the standard of undisputed land that would provide justification for an ADIZ over sovereign land. Coupled with the direct challenge to FONOPS by the US and the implied risk such a provocative move could have on the trade routes to the SCS, this would be a risk without enforceable gain.

The US recently flew two unarmed B52’s plus the sailing of US and Australian naval ships through the area for that very reason. Given China’s continual probing and testing of Taiwan’s defences, the declarations of ADIZ extensions are to increase the pressure on Taipei. Given those arguments, the question is that will China still declare an ADIZ although unenforceable? Perhaps. Reports say that China is looking forward to a less volatile relationship with Biden than it had with Trump. Therefore, I propose China will not test the new Administration (yet)."

Signaling that the U.S. remains strong despite current economic conditions may prompt the creation of an ADIZ, if China feels threatened or needs to act to push back on U.S. encroachment in some way. If Biden is sworn in as president in the U.S., there will likely be few changes in direct U.S. economic policy with China (maintain tariffs and current trade and debt levels). However, China could feel threatened if the U.S. begins to foster additional bilateral and multilateral economic and defense treaties in the region to increase its influence in the South China Sea. Additionally, an ADIZ will allow for early warning and protection of airfields on Scarborough Reef, Subi Reef, Woody Island, etc. and formalize the claim of the disputed territory."
