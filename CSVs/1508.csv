The law opens the window for such procedure until April 1 after which we cannot exclude the opportunity of stricter law or inversely milder. The present law invloves makes a company to have insurance for 5 million dollars, police escrt and costs might also include bad publicity due to accident or minor incident. The major reasons for the occurence of the test before 1 april is the competitive rivaly with uber and marketing. I would say that the escort point of the law restricts the results of the testing.
