Anyone can see this from the WHO Situation Reports (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/). Needless to say, I presume an abundance of caution on the part of the CDC and some level of political pressure. Furthermore, reducing the travel advisory would imply that China looks more like Japan, that is, has returned to some degree of normalcy. That does not seem likely in the near-term. We simply do not know enough to think that a return to normalcy would not trigger a fresh wave of nw cases. @Skildr points out that the SARS travel advisory lasted 96 days. In the link he shared (https://www.cdc.gov/about/history/sars/timeline.htm), the CDC says, ""CDC lifted the travel alert on Toronto because more than 30 days (or three SARS incubation periods) had elapsed since the date of onset of symptoms for the last reported case"", for its actions on May 20. For May 23: ""CDC reinstated travel alert for Toronto because on May 22, Canadian health officials reported a cluster of five new probable SARS cases."" I think a downgrading will demand a month or so of no new cases. China could achieve that within the next 30 days, giving the DCD 30 days from then to monitor the situation, so 60 days to be sure. So, let's say the first or second week of April is a good time to think the CDC might downgrade or lift the travel notice. However, though COVID-19 has a lower mortality rate than SARS (or MERS), it is transmitted between humans much more efficiently. For that reason, localizing it is very difficult so the CDC will be weary of a fresh wave of infections from China. Of course, China has much fewer rates of new cases than the UK and Western Europe, etc and in real as opposed to official figures, it is likely to have way fewer cases than the US, but I don't think that affects how the CDC will look at China. It makes sense to wait even if your home team is playing badly."

Given the Coronavirus has infected more people and has not yet peaked in terms of new cases which suggests a base case beyond mid-April for the travel ban to be reduced. I view it as pretty unlikely that the travel ban will be reduced before 15th April - this implies a more sanguine outcome than SARS - and view it as more likely that the travel ban is reduced after than 1 June than before given the outbreak's severity, plus the fact that beyond 1 June is open ended re timing."

It wasn’t until the 1890s that people figured out how the bacterial infection was being spread and a vaccine was created. Scientists declare how Corona virus being spread, but it is known that when the vaccine is available. Therefore, it is likely that the vaccine will take years to be developed. But it is not the only way to stop a virus such as MERS, SARS and EBOLA.
