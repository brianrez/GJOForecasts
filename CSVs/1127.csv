M2 has grown but the growth rate in M2 has fallen as well. I dont expect the inflation to level off just yet, they are still in massive problems, namely the deterioation in their oil industry is still crushing their economy. According to the study on hyperinflation ""On the Measurement of Zimbabwe’s Hyperinflation"" they conclude that the average hyperinflation period is around 20 months. Mind you with huge uncertainty given the very little data i.e. about 25-30 hyperinflation incidences in the 21st and 20th century and with uncertainty in gathering data. According to the con leche index, hyperinflation ""began"" around november 2018 - december 2018, given that the price doubled from 195 to 400 bolivars, a rapid increase. That is about 6-7 months of hyperinflation, vastly less than the average hyperinflation period of 20 months. Furthermore, even if inflation did suddenly drop to 1-2% per month, the annual inflation would still be higher. Thus, for the annual inflation rate to become less than 50,000%, we need to go from hyperinflation to deflation, which i dont believe is impossible but highly unlikely. The trend in annual inflation rate is slowing down, thus, i do think that it will grow, but i dont think it will in a matter of a few months grow beyond 100,000%. It is quite likely it does, but the most likely scenario given the current trend, the lower growth in M2 i expect inflation to be between 50,000-100,000% by september. 100,000-200,000 will be my next most likely scenario and will have the highest probability. My probability estimates for each ""category"" will be weighted with the crowd estimates - EDIT: I did weight the estimates, but the estimates where i had highest conviction i put more emphasis on my own perception than the crowd, giving more weight to my own estimate."
