The IMF data references Kansas city, so looked at Kansas city, wheat prices for Nov after roughly ascertaining that Oct prices + appx basis = IMF prices for Oct. The appx cash basis was about $0.7/bu. For Nov, the avg seems to be around 820ish + cash basis would put it the max -1 bucket."

At the time of the writing, the settlement price in bushels was 8.25, so converting to MT, I get roughly $303/MT. Reading the commentary, it seems that prices came off in the last few days which means they have been high for a period- which in turn would keep the avg price for Nov above $300."

This YTD, out of 9 months so far, prices have swung by ~$10/MT 2 months, ~$20/MT one month, ~$30/MT another month, and ~$40/MT 2 months. For only 3 months in 2021 has the swing been substantially <$10/MT. I still see the trend as being generally up. Based on Oct 1 through 16, I expect growth to be in the <$10/MT (+/-5) range for Oct. over Sept; I expect Oct's value to be ~$275 to $285/MT.
