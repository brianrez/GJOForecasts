The economic situation is becoming more dire, protests are escalating, and there is growing opposition towards the Maduro government. The Maduro regime has also responded with crackdowns on protesters and has vetoed any legislation passed by the opposition. The only real threats to Maduro's regime are the opposition and the military. The opposition, however, has been very disorganized due to ideological and political differences and have failed to create a united front against Maduro. Military coups have worked to create democracies before, as seen in Romania near the end of the Cold War. However, Maduro has recognized the threat from the military and has been promoted loyal officers and shared the oil wealth with the military, ensuring their loyalty. However, lower ranking officials and foot soldiers have joined the protesters as they have been largely ostracized from the military. If this, continues there could be a good chance for a coup in Venezuela and Maduro's replacement."

Maduro faces a high level of disapproval from the Venezuelan people and a fairly strong opposition, although there is a low likelihood that this will result in his removal from office; there is a widespread belief among the people that they are unable to make a difference, even by voting in upcoming elections. Maduro enjoys a high level of control over the government and a growing interdependence with the military. Further, upcoming elections are likely to encourage Maduro to further consolidate his power and crack down on any source of opposition."

Enough foreign currency continues to flow in to pay off the army. The army remains loyal to Maduro and has the numbers of organization to impose martial control over the population. Crude oil leaving Caracas currently amounts to about 1.65 mmbbl/day. Two conditions must be met to ensure Maduro has enough foreign currency coming in to keep the army loyal: Enough to purchase the naptha necessary to make the raw goop flow from Orinoco basin to port and enough to keep army happy. Rough estimate is that this critical all in level is somewhere around the 1.2 mmbbl/day level. At current rate of production decay, this takes us somewhere into 2019. So, no, Maduro will not be thrown out by July 2018."

Russia seems involved in his cryptocurrency which suggests they would want him in power. US want him gone but doubt they have ability to manipulate election whereas Russia seems to have a proven record in these matters. Worsening economy might provoke a citizens revolt.

The AP recently reported that Venezuela's pro-government election officials have announced that this year's election has been moved up to April (it is usually held at the end of the year). This move shuts out the opposition and adds fuel to the fire of protestors against Maduro. Venezuela's neighbors are adding to the tension. Colombia shares the humanitarian crisis, faces an influx of fleeing Venezuelans, and fears overspill of the political crisis; NPR reported today that Peru's foreign minister announced that Venezuela will not be welcome at this year's Summit of the Americas. Still, Maduro has managed to maintain his position through several months of the crisis, which is why I forecast a 50% chance that his removal from the presidency won't occur before July, even if he wins the election. Venezuela's history of clientelism complicates the issue and adds to the probability of his reelection. If he does win though (particularly if the opposition refuses to participate), the opposition may escalate, which is why I forecast his exit from the presidency at 45% between April and June."

It will have to be bailed out by someone this year or have major defaults and no more $ to keep Chavistas on board other than in ideology. I believe reason (i.e. Maduro's departure) will be imposed from outside if not come from within. China recently closed/ mad further progress on many S American large infrastructure deals but left out mention of Venezuela despite their huge financial support in the past. Therefore a Maduro departure could be demanded for more $ for oil from China. Maduro's departure may also come from a move by his own party to show Chavistas some response/ change giving the continually deteriorating economic and social conditions.

It is also clear that Maduro's government (and the PSUV party) has mismanaged the country and would not be able to win any fair election (it only won a third of the seat in the December 2015 parliamentary election, and the country has continued to deteriorate in the last 18 moths, so its reasonable to assume it would win even fewer seats now). There is no question that most Venezuelans would like Maduro to go, so the question is how this could be achieved. There appears little chance that Maduro or the PSUV would allow voters the chance to remove him. The recent sham vote for a new assembly shows that no one would believe the results of an election organised by the government. So the most likely way for Maduro to go would be an overthrow. According to reports the senior officers in the army are big beneficiaries of the Maduro regime. In fact the socialist revolution appears to be degenerating into a grab for money by the senior officers and those close to Maduro before the regime collapses. This suggests that the senior officers and officials are starting to plan for taking their money and running, because they do not expect the regime to last much longer. The most likely scenarios are either officers just loose control of the troops or that junior officers launch a coup. Many of the junior officers will have families that are now against the PSUV so they are the most likely to try to get rid of Maduro. Military coups are far from unknown in Venezuela (although the last two failed) I think it almost certain that a coup will take place, the question is how long before it does and will it succeed. My guess is that a serious coup will take place in the next 6 months. And it will have a 80% chance of success."

It seems that with every boldly anti-democratic move by both Maduro and the armed forces they always have a cover/ excuse to make their line with OAS etc, even if it's a thin and weak excuse. In this case replacing Maduro with another candidate, regardless of how close to or similar in viewpoint with Maduro he/she might be, would fill that need by being portrayed as an act by the military for the people of Venezuela. They could even promote the first female candidate to really dilute and nuance the European/ American media's response (Carmen Meléndez?). To prevent a full-on uprising or need for a full-on violent suppression by the military, a scapegoated and ousted Maduro would better serve both the interest of the ""Boilvarian revolution"" and that of the military. Maduro would probably portray the move as voluntary and as a mark of his dedication to the ""revolution"" ... he could retire in Havana or La Paz. Better than suppressing a full-on uprising and having the entire world distancing themselves and provoking/ justifying a Trump-lead response, regardless of what form that response might take."

I also think he genuinely believes the bogus narrative his government is pushing and that he feels he is the victim in all this. So with that in mind the question is when do regimes fall and what makes them finally do so. I have a link below to an interesting analysis of when this happens but the overriding point is that as long as low level soldiers are willing to keep killing civilians, even large numbers of civilians. the government is not going to fall. The government's finances today feel similar (at my cursory reading) to those of Zimbabwe or Syria where most things have broken down but the security services are still being paid, at least high level members are. The second link (in Spanish, sorry about that) describes how more than 100 members of the military have been detained so I think the government is weaker than it seems. I don't think that, with growing fissures in the military and the government nearly broke already, Maduro lasts the year."

The soldiers, who include colonels and captains, are being held in Ramo Verde prison in the hills outside Caracas, according to lists being circulated within the military. The lists emerged after allegations by Venezuelan opposition leaders that a purge is underway within the military to quash dissent over the handling of massive demonstrations against the socialist government since early April. The documents seen by Reuters only went up to April 8, after which the opposition and rights activists say scores more soldiers have been rounded up. The military's National Guard unit has been at the forefront of policing the protests, using tear gas, water cannons, and rubber bullets against masked youths who hurl stones, Molotov cocktails and excrement against security lines. At least 65 people have died, with victims including government and opposition supporters, bystanders and members of the security forces. Hundreds more have been injured. In public, top military officers have backed Maduro's accusation that an ""armed insurrection"" is being mounted by violent conspirators seeking a coup with U.S. backing. But opposition leaders say there is increasing disquiet within the military over the use of force against protesters who are demanding general elections, foreign humanitarian aid and freedom for jailed activists. https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2017-06-06/fourteen-venezuelan-army-officers-jailed-in-first-week-of-protests-documents ____________________________ COMMENTS: The situation in Venezuela in unsustainable, and not getting better while Maduro is president. Money managers at Goldman Sachs bought $2.8 billion face value of Petroleos de Venezuela bonds at a deep discount last week, attracting the ire of critics of President Nicolás Maduro. Maturing in 2022, they are not in the index because they are not publicly held, according to JPMorgan. The face amount bought represents more than 90 percent of the $3 billion issue Venezuela's economy has been in precipitous decline since Mr. Maduro succeeded Hugo Chávez in 2013. Goldman may earn a hefty profit if the Venezuelan economy bounces back, for that to happen Maduro has to be off. Maybe Goldman is betting exactly on that!"
