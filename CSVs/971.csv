Mr Kamerhe, a former speaker of the national assembly who ran for president in 2011, was a presidential candidate in 2018 before he withdrew and backed Mr Tshisekedi in a deal that would have seen him run as the ruling party’s pick in 2023 ... The conviction effectively ends that arrangement, since it leaves Mr Kamerhe no longer eligible to run for head of state again ... Stephanie Wolters, senior research fellow at the South African Institute of International Affairs, said it was interesting, given the 'ample evidence' of corruption in the former regime, that Mr Tshisekedi had allowed a member of his own coalition to be prosecuted but not yet any member of Mr Kabila’s group. Mr Tshisekedi has sought to win domestic and international support by promising to crack down on the graft and impunity that has long hobbled Congo’s development ... The failure of many of the infrastructure projects undertaken as part of Mr Tshisekedi’s plans for his first 100 days in office had also meant that someone needed to held responsible, Ms Wolters added."" https://www.ft.com/content/9f671621-0ce6-4bf6-a16e-2423753cd5a5"

As long as Tshisekedi does not diverge too far from Kabila’s will, and as long as there is no major disagreement or falling out between the two men, Kabila has no reason to seek a replacement for Tshisekedi (and risk potential truths about his role in the election becoming confirmed by the general population)."
