For now, the SP500 has dropped 5.37% compared to August 27th. Before Tuesday, the major events driving SP500 includes: 1. Power steaps on Capitol Hill on Tuesday (possibly pushing the markets up if Powell addresses QE uncertainty) 2. Potential new stimulus bill 3. Tech giants law suits 4. Sept economic data 5. Big company earnings (NIKE on the 22nd, etc.) It is essentially impossible for SP to have a more than 12% move in either direction in this scenario. Unless September turns out to be a strong comeback in terms of Macro economic, is it hard to imagine that the SP will rally more than 2% in the following two days to achieve August's level. Thus, it is mostly likely for SP500 to end up down around 3-7% compared to Aug 28th."
