Okay, it's true that a number of emerging markets are taking a risk approach with growing pressure on their currencies and that even China is considering to impose capita controls with its falling capital market. It's also true that Malaysia is facing a weak growth with revenues down due to oil prices and could possibly face a fiscal slippage . Moreover, Malaysia had recently a credit rating downgrade. However, it's important to notice that Prime Minister Najib Razak is, at the very least, sending messages to market agents that he is gonna taking the right measures. An example is that last year budget-deficit reduction was met and measures to boost private spending are taking place. Moreover, US are not elevating its interest. Thus, as a consequence Malaysia ringgit rose for five days already and today is the best performing emerging market currency. On top of that, ten-year sovereign bonds rose, pushing the yield down and there was a rally on brent crude. In a nutshell, things are looking better for Malaysia!! However, it all depends on what will happen to China. So, for the moment I will stick with just 1% and I´m gonna be looking very close as the economic climate develops."

This is probably the worst of the combination of low oil prices and turmoil in China, so if this hasn't prompted controls, then nothing else this year is likely to do so (famous last words). My prediction is that oil prices stabilize and start to drift up for most of 2016 and this will reduce downward pressure on ringgit. Plus if Chinese investors really start looking for novel ways to get their capital out, the ringgit might be cheap enough to put a certain gleam in their eyes, at least if they're willing to take some risks. If we get through spring, or oil gets back above $40, with no additional FX drama, I'll go down to 5%."

I'm just not a 100% on their stock market rebounding completely. I see a lot of state propping of companies to control the Chinese economic downturn. To be honest, this was the real problem in Malaysia and the only reason capital control was taken off the table was the assurance of a market rebound with China. That is my guess."

While I consider that their current foreign currency reserves are not as extensive as perhaps they should be, the country is considered an attractive foreign investment destination, a great exporter and has adopted many liberal, market-friendly reforms since the troublesome end of the 1990s. The 25% probability is based on a possible ousting of PM Najib's Goverment due to corruption scandals, and the election of a new, less market-friendly successor from UMNO, more similar to former PM Mahathir Mohamed. This could create instability and diminish the market's confidence in the country's economy and the ringgit."

Economy is still growing at a moderate pace and not in free fall 3. Much stronger and independent Central bank with a respected governor who have repeatedly said she believes the weakness in the ringgit is due to perception of the wrongdoings of 1 corporation, albeit sovereign owned, and not systemmic and is much likely to tow the line even if it comes from the Prime Miniter's office 4.
