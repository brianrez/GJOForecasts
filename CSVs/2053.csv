I was making a revenue statement but units are also, yes we expect units to be up as well.” (Tim Cook quotes from conference call transcripts on SeekingAlpha). Tim Cook does not make many of these forward looking statements and he does not strike me as the person to make these type of forecasts lightly. On the 26th of October, Tim Cook most likely knew the amount of iPhones sold up to 26th October (about 1/3 of the 2016Q1). The question is how many iPhone sold up to that time would him make comfortable expecting overall growth? I asked myself what number I would be comfortable with even if I had more information than I have. (He will have better data and a clear sales pattern in mind) I would most likely err on the side of caution. Particularly because that was a month after the introduction of the 6S and 6SPlus. If one thinks of a Sales number for October that would make him comfortable, it is easy to get a lowerbound estimate for the full quarter."

I found this intriguing clip from the above article: 'Apple reports holiday-quarter earnings Jan. 26, though it offered a tease Wednesday. Apple announced a record $1.1 billion in sales of App Store apps and in-app data in the two weeks ending Jan. 3. It included the biggest day of sales since the store launched in 2008, with $144 million of app-related purchases on New Year’s Day.' This could go either way, that consumers with existing handsets 'went ape on the apps', or new purchasers did.....??? As Vinny Barbarino used to lament, ""I'm so confused..... "" I'm going to revisit this in a few days and see where the media winds blow. Affirming forecast."

11181,2015-11-14T06:13:17Z,2,[98.0],[19.0],I update my earlier (79%) forecast substantially after a bit more research. - Based on my relative optimistic view compared to other forecasters around here my initial probability seems too low. - Some forecasters here whom have taken a serious crack at answering this question in different ways and by putting some numbers on this all get higher than 75 mln. - Cook is very confident that Apple will sell more than last year (74.5) and Mr. Cook is generally a cautious man when it comes to make any 'exact' forecasts. But in the Analyst Conference Call he is willing to say this. Cook has insight to the Chines data relative to other countries. YoY growth in China has been around 100%. Hard to get exact numbers but let's say sales last quarter (last year) in China were 1/3 of 75 or 25 mln and grow to 40 mln units (still well below 100%) (1/3 is conservative estimate based on suggestions that iPhone Sales in China have now surpassed US). That means that sales in other countries would have to drop from 50 to 35 mln. That seems farfetched. - Supporting the above China's middle class is expected to grow ten fold in the next five years. - Supporting the above Alibaba Single Day Sales have seen a dramatic increase. - I cannot find the Credit Suisse report itself and the articles on it are pretty vague. Apart from my earlier comment It would make sense that Apple slashes its orders most phones for this quarter have already been made and next quarter sales are always lower.

(over the years analyst prediction in aggregate seem to have become a bit more reliable). - I don't believe the 10% slash story with some suppliers. In the past these stories have always proven not to have any relation with actual sales. - The law of large numbers argument is only put forward by people who do not seem to understand what the law of large numbers actually is about. - There may be some cannibalism from the new products (Apple Watch, Apple TV, iPad Pro) but that will be off-set by a halo effect of new Apple users (increasing market share in PC's etc). - The Chinese market is becoming increasingly important in sales and particularly US based investors and analysts seem to have difficulty to understand its sheer size and potential and the love Chinese Apple users seem to feel for their iPhones). - The new annual upgrading program seems hugely popular which may help increase the US numbers - The iPhone 6S has become available in many more countries and much faster than with previous releases - Economies are recovering a bit allowing more consumers to treat themselves after the tougher years - Apple's new strategy in India might also start to take off. - Only twenty percent of current iPhone owners have upgraded and so there is a large potential there for new phones as iPhone users hardly switch. - On the downside consumer with less to spend may hold off for the smaller iPhone which is rumoured to appear next year. - I also may be biased as I own Apple shares, and have long ago decided that life's too short to use Microsoft (or Android) based products."

Righteously though? i don't think so. By all metrics, the trend should remain upwards. Moreover, if Apple can jump from 57 to 74,5m without any substantial, novel efforts as to strategy, that's for me in and of itself indicatory of, in any event, no 'ceiling'. That's all for now. Next step for me, making place for dissonance. Please, let me know what's your position on this."

The suggests to me that demand was a little weaker this year than last. The ""S"" releases to me do not sell as well as the full next generation devices, simply because customers who went with the initial generation will not upgrade immediately to the ""S"" and many service providers will not yet give an upgrade option as the existing unit is still less than 1 year. So it becomes a costly upgrade. I can't see apple making the target without some aggressive discounting."

A lot of this seems to be driven by the fact that consumers seem to like last September's iPhone 6 a lot more than the 5, 5S and 5C before (those two years sales did not go up as strongly as the years before). In fact, many simply might have waited to buy a (new) Apple phone until larger sizes are available. The reason why I am lowering the probability is the overall high level of sales (i.e. market saturation), weaker macro economic climate, and stronger competition (iphone still seems to be the best allrounder, but not the best in each and every category). Let's see how the Q4 results will look like (to be published end October)!"

212,2015-10-13T13:08:24Z,2,[92.0],[-4.0],"I was initially drawn into the doubt that Apple would not reach the 75m mark, but found a few issues with the Pacific Crest analysis. Firstly, it's just one analysis of the situation from a firm with a track record that I can't find out. The analysis also seems to be focused on the 6S' sales, and reading over my previous forecast, I read how with the 6 now being $100 cheaper, sales growth won't just come from the 6S. More importantly with the analysis, there wasn't as much detail as I'd have liked. Assuming that the excerpts which have been published in articles like this (http://www.businessinsider.com.au/iphone-6s-sales-disappointing-pacific-crest-2015-10), which have been mentioned by quite a few others before me, are all that he's said on this topic and is all the detail that he goes into, then it has to be questioned what Apple's initial ""component orders"" or ""expectations"" were. It's all relative; so if Apple's initial expectations and component orders were for iPhone sales of say 80m, then below expectations or ""disappointing sales"" might not mean sales will fall below 75m. His sources might have been similarly vague about describing sales. How does he calculate an estimate of 67m units? In terms of what he says about fewer stores selling out of iPhones, as I recall, last year's iPhone release had supply issues considering demand beat expectations (quick search gives 71.5m) and also issues with manufacturing the 6 Plus' larger screen. On the final point, that “almost all carriers surveyed indicated that iPhone 6s sales were down y/y, compared to the iPhone 6.”, I'm assuming he's referring to US carriers. Now couldn't it be possible that people just aren't buying from carriers and are waiting for the sim-free (unlocked) iPhone? (which apparently just started production http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/10/08/apple-starts-sales-of-sim-free-iphone-6s-6s-plus-handsets) This article goes over some of the points raised here and in my previous forecast: http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/12/the-iphone-sales-slump-doomsayers-are-forgetting-t.aspx Overall, its probably still a bit early to say that the 75m mark won't be reached since many countries haven't even started selling iPhones yet, but just in case all my assumptions are wrong, there's a decrease in my forecast."
