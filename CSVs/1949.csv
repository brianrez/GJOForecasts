Increased West, since a Thunder win over the Spurs makes them more likely to win it all. Only bumped Warriors up 6% (but now my favorites to win it all), because although after a slow start Curry had a phenomenal finish, I'm being cautious with his injury. How did he feel the next day etc, particularly since he probably played more minutes because of overtime than they would have liked him to in his first game back.

The Warriors would have the edge except for Curry's injury. Although I expect the Warriors are good enough to make it a few weeks without Curry, there are many unknowns. He could be out longer, could reinjure himself, could come back rusty from a long layoff. With the injuries to the Clippers, I don't feel the remaining teams in the West are much stronger than the East. I give a slight edge to the West, because I feel they have the next most dangerous team in the Thunder."
