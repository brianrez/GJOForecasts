The second step will be to acquire mechanical knowledge about the disease. They lifted Zika PHEIC when the link to microcephaly was considered ""robust"". They also meddled with Ebola PHEIC/not-PHEIC in political terms (10.1016/S0140-6736(19)31406-0), so there are more factors to this. At the same time, the timeline seems pretty easy, that is they don't have in habit to LIFT PHEIC so quickly and that declaration was definitely in the context of 30th January (10x less cases than today!), so May seems safe."

The CDC has been preparing to stop the spread but the White House maintains that the disease is under control. This lack of proper communication to the public is indicative of a larger lack of communication or even plain ignorance between public health official and the executive branch which could make the problem in the US much worse than need be. The WHO has also recently (Feb 24, 2020) stated that despite a reported decrease in infections in China, the spread may not be contained globally as cases in Italy, Iran, and South Korea grow. The WHO's fear of a pandemic is enough for me to think that this outbreak will continue for several more months at the level of a PHEIC."

As such, there is the very real possibility that we are on the ""brink of a pandemic"" [3].

Both Iranian victims were elderly locals who hadn't traveled abroad, meaning they were infected by contagious unknowns. Since death rate is approx 2% that means there are likely at least 100 infected & potentially uncontained individuals in region making a more serious outbreak akin to that of China, but without China's infection management capacity, inevitable. Given regional instability it seems likely such an outbreak will (or already has) spread further still into nations with yet poorer health facilities & conditions for containment. Whether or not the virus is still deemed an emergency by May 6th may depend on its ability to survive changing temperatures & jump the equator. Relative winter temperatures and humidity levels in Australia, S America & NZ etc suggest it would be relatively easy for the virus to survive & thrive given access to these nations via undiagnosed (or late diagnosed) travelers over the coming months. All of this presupposes the unknown of mutation. If it burns itself out I may be completely wrong. If it adapts to different hosts, conditions, crosses to other species or becomes more contagious, we may see much worse, globally, than China has already experienced & over a significant period of time. Nb: It's unlikely many nations will have the capacity or will to imposes draconian containment protocols on its citizens as China & the virus is believed to have a 9 day life span on surfaces outside the body - two reasons to think China may still be the tip of the ultimate infection pool iceberg."

Is the event unusual or unexpected? Is there a significant risk for international spread? Is there a significant risk for international travel or trade restrictions? Three of these questions might be answered and affirmed: the event is unusual in terms of the long incubation period of the virus in humans. There is significant risk of international spread as result of long incubation period where carriers are not aware of their spread level. In 52 days, 26 countries have been infected already, so the rate of infection is faster than previous pandemics like Swine flu in 2009. Nevertheless, it doesn’t show a high rate of mortality. There is significant risk of international travel and trade restrictions as the virus spreads rapidly, then countries are imposing travel restrictions. Because China has imposed internal bans, then factories are not producing, and has impact on international trade. Nevertheless, this issue does not constitute a trade restriction directly but might have an impact on trade in terms of decrease of products offer, hence, there might be a price increase for customers. 2)Autumn in the South hemisphere is about to start, and this might lead to addition of newly infected countries. Some of these countries are not prepared with resources to fight against a massive spread of the virus, for example, some countries in South America and Africa with inadequate or unprepared health services. 3)As the increase of infected people is faster than in other pandemics, then production of medicines might not be able to cope with a high demand. For this reason, developed countries might also not be able to provide support to poor countries as they will give priority to their own citizens. Also, politicians might use the pandemic as a leverage tool for achieving gains in negotiations with China. 4)The development of a vaccine against the virus is expected for 2021, longer than in other pandemics. 5)China is also trying to avoid the media storm while in trade negotiations with the US, and therefore, might also be providing innacurate data, which eventually will come to the light. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Health_Emergency_of_International_Concern https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/health/24flu.html https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-7995583/How-killer-coronavirus-compares-SARS-swine-flu-Ebola-Interactive-map.html https://larepublica.pe/economia/2020/02/14/coronavirus-afecta-primera-fase-del-acuerdo-comercial-entre-china-y-estados-unidos/ https://larepublica.pe/mundo/2020/02/13/coronavirus-aliexpress-cancelo-pedidos-a-espana-por-el-covid-19-enfermedad-oms-fotos/ https://larepublica.pe/sociedad/2020/02/11/coronavirus-peru-se-descarta-presencia-de-virus-y-se-activan-protocolos/ https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20200215/473557546877/coronavirus-wuhan-casos-fallecidos-sintomas-china-espana-mwc-2020-barcelona-gsma-ultimas-noticias-hoy-en-directo.html"
