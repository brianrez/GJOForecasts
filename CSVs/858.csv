Saudi Arabia announced back in April that the cuts will be effectively ~12.5 million bpd as they plan to reduce production even more than under the OPEC agreement [2]. This means OPEC would effectively cut by ~8.8 million bpd assuming OPEC+ countries cut by ~3.6 million bpd. OPEC oil production was ~30 million bpd in April [3].
