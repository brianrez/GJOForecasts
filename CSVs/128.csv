Based on ELO ratings, to get to the round of 16 they would need to get the 2nd spot again England (rated 6th at https://www.eloratings.net/) or Iran (23rd and close to home) or the 4th team (either Ukriane 16th or Wales 22rd). So basically we're asking what are the chances they can either have some amazing run and upset England or beat both of the other teams that are close to them in skill. Base rate would be close to 1 in 3 that they progress past the group stage but US soccer and a young team without much experience together tells me it is less than that, so going with 25%. Assigning 1/10th of that to progressing to the quarterfinals. Anything beyond that is well south of 1%."
