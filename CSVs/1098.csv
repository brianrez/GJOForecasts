Although a tentative peace agreement was mediated by the AU, tensions are still high and attacks are ongoing. These attacks may just be for the rebel groups to save face among their supporters, not wanting to be viewed as weak for working with the government. Due to the peace deal signed earlier this year (in which some rebel leaders where given government positions), it seems unlikely that rebels will carry out a systematic campaign that will leave over 1,000 dead. Such a campaign would only serve to hurt their progress, unless it is in response to actions and policies undertaken by the government. However, after years of conflict with the rebels in addition to a weak economy , I think it is unlikely that the government will do anything to seriously jeopardize it's improving relationship with the rebels. I estimate 5% rather than 3.7% because Sidiki Abass, leader of my 3R and current military advisor to the Prime Minister, is a bit of a wild card. His appointment may end up inflaming tensions in the long run."
