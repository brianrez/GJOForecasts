The rocket that landed off Japan’s west coast yesterday followed a high, “lofted” trajectory whose range implies the missiles could travel 7,000km—enough to reach Alaska. That is striking progress, although the country is still far from having a reliable nuclear warhead. In January President Donald Trump promised that a North Korean ICBM test “won’t happen”; he may now look weak. That he recently claimed to have given up on getting help from China to curb the North’s nuclear ambitions won’t help either. Calls for new UN sanctions come as existing ones are poorly enforced. Some hawks argue for pre-emptive American strikes, but that would bring unthinkable retaliation risks for South Korea. Mr Trump promised a new direction on North Korea. Instead he is stuck with the old, lousy options"

Varying tests of components of the nuclear missile program has occurred as well since restarting nuclear production last year. Whether NK is capable of implementing a successful nuclear test is not is not quite clear -- given the size of the tremors near its nuclear plant where underground tests occurred, one can assume some level of success. The various stages of component design, development, testing and launching (needs highly compotent scientists, fissile material and other factors) can occur within one or several cycles depending on the stage of technological development. Since only one nuclear test has occurred (2016) but 5 over 2 decades that we know of, it is likely that there could be component ( or module) tests this year. There is clear urgency and intentionality in weapons development, fissile production and testing given the current relations between NK and USA. Given Pyongyang's bellicose rhetoric toward its rivals, it is capable of producing 6 kilograms of plutonium (a sufficient requirement for building 1 nuclear bomb) per year. With prior production storage of fissile material, at this point, we know that has a capability of the use of 14 - 48 nuclear missiles. While NK claims it can mount nuclear warheads on its missile and has the capability to employ an ICBM, it is less clear that this is the case."

Key Findings The provocation window between South Korean elections and North Korean provocations has become more narrow over time. A previous Beyond Parallel study also found that North Korean kinetic provocations, including missile and nuclear tests, have clustered increasingly closer to U.S. elections. Under Kim Jong-un, the average window for a North Korean provocation bracketed around all ROK elections is 6.5 days (about 1 week). The average for presidential elections is 15 days or about two weeks. This represents a significant change from previous periods: Under the leadership of both Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il the window was an average of about 10 and 11 weeks respectively. There has been a transformation in the types of kinetic provocations that North Korea has carried out over the last 20 years. The provocations are now overwhelmingly comprised of missile and nuclear tests rather than other types of conventional kinetic military actions. This pattern suggests a provocation as early as two weeks before the South Korean elections on May 9th. The start of the provocation window falls on Military Foundation Day (April 25), a holiday in North Korea, and 10 days after the 105th anniversary of Kim Il-sung’s birthday on April 15th (KST)."
