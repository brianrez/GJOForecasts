Only in 8x03 and 8x04 some important characters died - Missandei, Theon and Jorah mostly - but, apart from Missandei, they were important characters for their history rather than for their actual role - Theon's and Jorah's role was basically inexistent for the proceeding of the plot. Missandei's death has a very important role to ignite, together with the dragon's death, Denaerys' rage. In the final episodes I really hope GOT will go back to its glory days, in which important characters die underlining the cruelty of the politics and military world, the very peculiarity which made GOT interesting and was erased in the last two seansons. In the inevitable final confrontation between Cercei and Denaerys, some heads will roll. While everyone in 8x04 seems sure Denaerys has the keys to the victory, I really think that as a matter of preparation, military planning and strategic advance Cercei has the upper hand. In this scenario, Bronn has most possibilities to survive, he demonstrated to be an excellent swordman and an opportunistic mentality which allows him to survive by always getting on the winning side. Even the promise of receiving High Garden will not make him sacrifice his life over a lost cause. I really think that, however the final confrontation goes, he'll find a way to survive. On the other side, Tyrion is more in danger. He could consider to plot against Denaerys with Varys - who, at this point, in order to safeguard King's Landing's population, will make its move - but he doesn't seem to be willing to do so. His death would be very in line with GOT's initial style, and in the confrontation with Cercei's army he certainly risks a lot. Nevertheless, he has a chance to survive - in the last seasons, the beloved characters are simply not dying, so... I find the ""both surviving"" scenario really unlikely, as well as the ""neither will survive"" one. Some central characters will die in the last two episodes - if everyone survives, it's going to be a farce. I just think that Tyrion's direct political involvement will not help him in the final confrontation, while Bronn's adaptability will help him."

Tyrion Lannister is quite the significant character and up until the last episode (S8 E4) has rarely put himself in physical harm's way. Also in the last episode, Bronn threatened to kill Tyrion and his brother, although the fan backlash if that occurred would be immense. In seasons 1-3 especially, being a main character would not ensure survival, however so far in season 8, we have seen plot armor protect main characters from even the most outrageous danger.
