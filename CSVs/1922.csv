Even if the lift doesn't lead to a victory of ""leave"", it would definitely cause an ongoing hostile migration-debate which could severely damage the relationship between EU and UK. 2) Apart from the Leave-Remain-campaign in UK: A lift of those requirements would cause major discussions with Eastern & Central European states which are opposing this lift. Even if the governments would support the lift, it would cause domestic problems for those states and might be a source of political instability (e.g. in Germany it could lead to an open challenge of Angela Merkel by the right wing of the conservative party and by CSU and support the rise of AfD). 3) Such lift would directly challenge the core principles of EU since they would need to ignore there own rules in order to lift visa requirements for Turkish citizens. 4) It's questionable if Erdogan is really intending to cause major problems if there is no lift, Turkey (and he himself) would have much to loose and it's also not said that EU doesn't find another way of solving the refugee-crisis (he would just have the power to force EU to such a lift, if it is certain that there is no other way of controlling the crisis than working with Turkey in that way)."

Mr Erdogan wants a German satirist prosecuted for a poem that accused him, among other things, of goat-molestation. It may happen; free-speech advocates are appalled. Politicians from all parties want Germany to be firmer. A big diplomatic clash looms on June 2nd, when lawmakers will pass a resolution terming the Ottoman mass-killing of Armenians “genocide”. Mr Erdogan is outraged already. It won’t be an easy weekend for Mrs Merkel as she tries to salvage her most important, and most troubled, international relationship --------- Looks like my forecast is too high already, but let's see what Merkel will be able to accomplish during this meeting."

While earlier (i.e., March 2016) reports featured significant pessimistic rhetoric, these seem linked moreso - functionally - to government leadership-related and human rights-related bias. Human rights violations appear to drive the process toward appeasement more directly than political disparagement. The international legal complex, in other words, seems compromised by the EU's own sense of [dis]unity and some of its members' opportunistic agendas. Ultimately, the EU could feel international pressure to accommodate refugees despite grassroots sentiments to the contrary. My positive forecast is tempered, however, by anti-dictatorship, anti-corruption sentiment and ongoing internal tensions in Turkey, Greece and Syria."

My guess would be that Erdogan will play the hard line against the EU, and will stop the Turkish effort to stop the refugees leaving to Greece if he doens't get what he wants (no visa for Turkish people to travel to EU). The terrorist legislation is the core-problem for the EU to grant Turkey the lift of visa requirements. The hide and seek between Turkey and EU will take more weeks as the 6 weeks timeframe left within this question. Therefore I would say 20% as a start. Following the developments closely."
