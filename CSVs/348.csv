That includes both as CEO and Chairman. I don't know much about Zuckerberg, but from what I've read/heard, he strikes me as the type of person who would not want to share power - i.e., I don't see him wanting to have some sort of co-CEO or co-Chairman. There has to be one decision maker and that's Zuckerberg, of course."

I understand the reasoning behind it, even just this month Zuckerberg has come under intense scrutiny for his leadership skills in an article published by CNBC after Meta had a 232 billion dollar drop in the stock market this February, the largest in US history. However, Zuckerberg's job seems relatively stable for the next few months and possibly years, but it has become clear his time leading his company may be coming to a close."

It wouldn't be good press for him to step down due to problems in the company, I think he would try to fix issues first before considering stepping down. I think he will step down eventually but not before October 1, 2022."

However, this convention has been put aside in recent years so long as it achieves high growth. Zuckerberg's Metaverse plan is fairly sound and if unhindered will generate high growth and ensure his position. But, if there are any more scandals around Meta or Zuckerberg himself, it would very likely lead to his replacement as chairman and possibly also as CEO. Also, if the release of Project Cambria is botched or the product receives lacklustre sales due to high pricing, then this could lead to his being replaced as Chairman."

The company owned and ran the website. The *website* didn't have a Chairman or CEO; the *company* did. The same holds true now. Facebook, the company, changed its name to Meta. As before, Meta owns the Facebook website/social media platform. From Meta: ""Our corporate structure is not changing, however, how we report on our financials will. Starting with our results for the fourth quarter of 2021, we plan to report on two operating segments: Family of Apps and Reality Labs."" https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/ So ""Facebook"" doesn't have a Chairman or CEO right now; Meta does. And unless a new company is formed to run the Facebook website/social media platform, it will continue to be run by Meta. I am going to guess that that will continue to be how FB operates; I don't foresee Zuckerberg ever letting go voluntarily, especially for some riskier venture. And I can't picture some Family of Apps holding company being split off under Meta because his Reality Labs need cash from the Family of Apps, although it's possible that funds could just be channeled through Meta."
