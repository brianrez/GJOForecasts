As Lashkar Gah is the provincial capital it would be politically unacceptable for it to fall especially as the Taliban has refused to negotiate with the government, likely because they think they can make serious gains. Right now the main area for the Taliban offensive seems to be the neighbouring province of Farah, where they have made significant gains. There is a chance however that the Taliban will mount another offensive against Helmand while the Afghan focuses on Farah."

That challenge is expected to come into clearer focus with the approach of parliamentary elections planned for July. The administration ""not only faces a deteriorating security situation, it has no clear political, governance, or economic strategy to produce Afghan stability,"" Cordesman said. In his view, the U.S. military has been assigned a ""mission impossible"" in Afghanistan. The weak central government in Kabul and the resilient Taliban insurgency are not the U.S. military's only problems there. It also faces what Gen. Joseph Votel, the top U.S. general overseeing the war, calls interference by Russia. He told a congressional panel last month that Moscow is seeking to undermine U.S. and NATO influence in Afghanistan by exaggerating the presence of Islamic State fighters there and portraying this as a U.S. failure."""

The commander’s death is a blow to the militant group that has been responsible for deadly suicide bombings and terrorist attacks in Pakistan for over a decade. The commander, Khan Sayed, who also went by the name Khalid Sajna, was the No. 2 leader of the Pakistan Taliban. He also led his own breakaway faction of fighters from the Mehsud tribe, which inhabits the rugged, semiautonomous South Waziristan region along the border with Afghanistan. Pakistani intelligence officials thought he had been killed in a 2015 American drone strike and were still trying to confirm this latest report of his death. But they saw credibility in this claim because the Taliban announced his death and the appointment of a successor. His death could force more Mehsud Taliban members to surrender to the Pakistani military “as they have lost the only unifying figure in their ranks,” said Saleem Safi, a senior analyst and a Geo News talk-show host. It could also lead to infighting between the Pakistani Taliban’s factions over the group’s leadership, he said.

A feared militant commander, he also claimed to have masterminded the 2012 jailbreak in the northwestern town of Bannu that resulted in the escape of nearly 400 inmates, including several high-profile militants. Pakistani officials have been critical of the American drone strikes on the Pakistani soil, arguing that they are a violation of the country’s sovereignty. But last week’s attack that killed Mr. Sayed did not elicit a strong reaction from Pakistan’s Foreign Office"""

""When I leave home, I'm uncertain whether I will come back alive,"" said one man, Sardar, in Shindand, a western district that suffers weekly attacks. ""Explosions, terror and the Taliban are part of our daily life."" The extent to which the Taliban have pushed beyond their traditional southern stronghold into eastern, western and northern parts of the country is clearly visible from the BBC study. Areas that have fallen to the Taliban since 2014 include places in Helmand province like Sangin, Musa Qala and Nad-e Ali, which foreign forces fought and died to bring under government control after US-led troops had driven the Taliban from power in 2001. More than 450 British troops died in Helmand between 2001 and 2014. In the areas defined as having an active and open Taliban presence, the militants conduct frequent attacks against Afghan government positions. These range from large organised group strikes on military bases to sporadic single attacks and ambushes against military convoys and police checkpoints."""

VOA, January 13, 'Afghan General: Haqqani Network, Not IS, Behind Spike in Violence': https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-general-haqqani-network-islamic-state/4206961.html Clips from VOA article: Experts are divided over who the members of the Islamic State in Afghanistan are and whether the Haqqani network and other terror groups have rebranded themselves as IS in the country. Some security experts like Atiqullah Amarkhil push back against Radmanesh’s claims and argue that shifting blame from IS to Haqqani does not solve the problem nor does it reduce the severity of the security problem Afghanistan faces. “We should not deceive our people by stating that Haqqani is behind the attacks, not IS. They both are,” Amarkhil, a Kabul-based retired general, told VOA. “IS is more active and trying to spread fear and create a gap between government and citizens,” Amarkhil added. Abdul Wahid Taqat, another security analyst and a former senior intelligence official in the Afghan government, agrees with Radmanesh and maintains that IS in Afghanistan is comprised of members of various banned Pakistani groups. “The IS in Afghanistan is not linked to the one in Iraq and Levant [Syria]. This IS is composed of illegal Pakistani groups,” Taqat told VOA. “They [IS] are the Haqqanis, members of Lashka-e-Taiba, Sepah-e-Sahaba, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Jaish-e-Moahmmad, Harakat-ul-Islam and etc. And now Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence [ISI] gave them a new name.”"

It was back in 2014 that IS began to appear in what it calls Khorasan - Afghanistan, Pakistan, Central Asia, Iran and India. In attacking Shi’ite targets like those in Kabul on Thursday, its aim is to stir up sectarian hatred in the hope of undermining an already vulnerable Afghan government. The incremental growth of IS runs in tandem with the already well-established presence of the Taliban, which remains the dominant Islamist militant group operating in the country, and still controls large parts of Afghanistan."""

U.S. and Afghan commanders see air power as a vital weapon to prevent the area falling completely to the insurgents. Building up Afghanistan's own air power is a central part of President Ashraf Ghani's four-year strategic plan and the Afghan Air Force has steadily bolstered its capacity to provide logistical support to ground forces as well as air strikes. But one consequence has been an increase in the number of unintended casualties caused by accidents. According to U.N. figures published in July, there was a 43 percent increase in the number of civilian casualties caused by U.S. and Afghan airstrikes in the first half of the year."""

But even his own generals have conceded that a complete military victory in Afghanistan is not possible. The only solution most see is to persuade the Taliban to sit down to peace talks, something they have refused to do as long as U.S. soldiers remain in the country. And with the insurgents gaining ground steadily in the past two years, the Taliban have even less incentive to negotiate. “It seems America is not yet ready to end the longest war in its history,” said Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, after Trump announced his policy. “As Trump stated, ‘Americans are weary of the long war in Afghanistan.’ We shall cast further worry into them and force American officials to accept realities.”"

More air support — in the form of more F-16 fighters, A-10 ground attack aircraft and additional B-52 bomber support, or a combination of all three — is also probably on the way, according to a U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss plans that had not yet been made public. The B-52s will remain based in Qatar but will be tasked to cover Afghanistan. Small Marine artillery detachments, composed of about 100 or so troops per unit, will be spread around the country to fill in gaps in air support, the official said."""

But it's hard to think of what the alternative is because the only other alternatives are - A, we can withdraw or, B, we can send a heck of a lot more U.S. troops. But neither option seems terribly attractive. And so I think President Trump basically chose the status quo option, which again is not sexy or exciting.

BBC News, June 3, 'Kabul blast: Deadly explosions at protest victim's funeral': http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40142606 Clips from article: ""Kabul has now had three deadly incidents in four days. Residents are still reeling from the aftermath of the huge suicide attack which killed over 90 people earlier this week. Anger at the government for not doing more to prevent that attack led to protests on Friday. Now the funeral of one of those victims has been targeted, presumably by a militant group. A number of high-profile politicians were present at the funeral today. The fact that even they are not immune to the rising violence shows the scale of the threat in the city. Kabul was once considered the most secure part of Afghanistan. Now it seems the most dangerous."""
