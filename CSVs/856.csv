"Before 1 October 2020, will North Korea announce that it has a new head of state?",2020-05-01T17:00:47Z,2020-10-01T07:01:47Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']","['Leader Entry/Exit', 'Security and Conflict']",1353,654,677,237,,https://www.gjopen.com/questions/1607-before-1-october-2020-will-north-korea-announce-that-it-has-a-new-head-of-state

96070,2020-09-30T23:23:41Z,1,[1.0],[1.0],"Regarding whether or not North Korea will announce a new head of state before October 1st 2020, I believe that the chance of this happening is close to 0%. I won’t say completely 0% because there could be a minute chance for most anything to happen. You can never truly know until it happens. However, I believe that despite North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, admitting this past August that his 5-year plan from 2016 for improved economic growth by 2020 had been unsuccessful according to the New York Times articles titled “North Korea’s Leader Had Big Economic Plans, He Admits They’ve Failed,” it is unlikely that he will step down or be deposed and have a new head of state by October 1st, possibly not even at all. Additionally, thus far North Korea’s Supreme Leaders have only left office in their death. The 1st Supreme Leader of North Korea, Kim Il-sung, held the position until July 8th, 1994. On that date, Kim Jong-il took office and held the position until his death on December 17th, 2011. Kim Jong-un took office on that date. With this in mind, I believe it is most likely that Kim Jong-un will remain the 3rd Supreme Leader of North Korea until his death."
95906,2020-09-30T23:19:00Z,1,[2.0],[2.0],"Considering it is 30 Sept and 1 Oct is right around the corner. I would give it a 0%, however with North Korea, you never know, so I give it a 2% probability. I think there is very low probability that North Korea will announce a new head of state this week. Although Kim is not healthy and there is tension within his ranks I certainly believe it is doubtful the North Korean regime will announce a new head of state or even be forthcoming about any potential change in leadership in the next few days. There are still underlying issue with Kim leading the country, but there is also little reason at this time to believe a regime shake will even happen this year, unless Kim disappears due to health issues which seemed to be an issue earlier this year."

The one piece of information that may point to the alternative is reports earlier this year of Kim's health being uncertain, and possibly even vegetative. But those reports seem to have subsided."

95561,2020-09-28T13:02:45Z,1,[8.0],[8.0],I find it very unlikely that there will be a new head of state announced before October 1. Something incredible would have to happen in the next 3 days for a new leader to be appointed.
95657,2020-09-28T04:46:08Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"Considering we are only a few days removed from October 1st, 2020, the likelihood of North Korea announcing a new head of state is next to none within this time frame. The fear is that Kim Jong Un is secretly dead due to his poor health and constant disappearances from public eyes and that his much more dangerous sister would take over the regime. However, multiple reports show that the leader is in fact alive, albeit likely in the same poor health conditions. A much more apt question would be to ask if he'll still be alive in 5 years' time, which is questionable considering his condition."
95317,2020-09-28T03:55:03Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"During the pandemic I believe that North Korea will attempt to give the perception that it will remain strong. That being said I don't believe that it will announce anything in the near future to make its people believe that Kim Jong Un is still alive and that its government is ""strong"" and fully capable of keeping the pandemic out of the country. Kim Jong Un did apologize for killing a South Korean citizen recently so there is a chance he is still alive. https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/north-korea-kim-jong-un-shooting/2020/09/25/6b671ea8-feee-11ea-b0e4-350e4e60cc91_story.html"
95486,2020-09-28T03:48:28Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],According to CNN the SOuth Korean advisor said that the North Korean leader is alive. He continued to add that he had been in hiding since april 13th. I think there is a 5% chance that North Korea will announce a new head of state. Kim Jung- un has released recent news so therefore he is still in power and he is not lieky to change power in the next 3 days. https://news.yahoo.com/happen-north-korea-kim-jong-un-died-100746225.html https://www.economist.com/asia/2020/04/30/north-koreas-dictator-has-disappeared https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/27/asia/kim-jong-un-health-letter-south-african-president-intl/index.html
95547,2020-09-28T03:20:13Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],"It still remains a mystery as to the current health of Kim Jong Un. According to his government, he is still alive and well, however, there has still been no spoken word from him or any recent action by the North Korean leader. The government of the country may want to claim he is still alive in order to maintain control, even if he is in fact deceased."
95557,2020-09-28T03:16:17Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"There is a 5% chance that North Korea will announce a new head of state. In past years when a new successor has announced the current head of state will do it well in advance before they step down to make it clear who the next heir is. That is was Kim Jong-un the 1st did and so did the second when handing over the title. Kim Jong Un is believed to be ill but not so ill where he has announced a new head of State unless he has died, and the Government is just covering it up for now. Many people believe Kim Jong-un is either dead or in a coma, most everybody agrees that he is ill. Every bit of information that the North Korean government has released about the wellness of Kim Jung Un cannot be trusted so any prediction that is made is made off of conspiracy and second-hand information."
95570,2020-09-28T02:55:38Z,1,[1.0],[1.0],"Recently, it has not been uncommon for North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, to go into a shadow and without ever saying a word. I'm sure his health is playing a big role in the fact. His sister has been seen taking on many of the roles of his but they have not declared her as the new head of state. Even if Kim Jong-un died/dies in the next couple days, I still don't see North Korea announcing it and publicly declaring a new head of state."
95294,2020-09-28T02:41:52Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],"While many reports began to surface about Kim Jungs death or being in a Coma first reported by the South Koreans, it appears that a mistranslation about a procedure Kim underwent for his heavy smoking were quickly misreported by CNN. As much of unknown the misinformation campaign by North Korea capitalized on the mistake and showed an official state photo of Kim opening a fertilizer factory. Adding difficulty, was the upscale swing of Covid 19 shutting down the country. ”A footnote: As of April 30, two days before Kim re-emerged in public, Daily NK — the original source of the Kim rumors — had bumped up its assessment of his condition from ailing to dead. It acknowledged that this was only a rumor, too, of course.”"
95709,2020-09-28T02:25:06Z,1,[2.0],[2.0],"Since October 1st is just a few days away I believe that there is little to no chance that there will be a new head of state announced. Unless Kim Jong Un dies there is no chance, and this is why I give it a 2% chance of happening."
95295,2020-09-28T02:23:12Z,1,[2.0],[2.0],"Throughout 2020, Kim has been seen around once a month. This is extremely rare for any leader, and it raises many questions involving his health and recent “surgery”. Also, with him becoming more recluse, we see his sister, Kim Yo Jong, taking on more and more of his roles as head of state. She has currently been utilizing the same, if not more, supreme power that her brother has. With Kim Jong-un’s obvious poor health, his sister very well may be the next head of state. This may be sooner than later, but it will not happen before 1 October 2020. Kim Jong-Un was also seen on 25 September as he publicly apologizes for killing a South Korean official. Even if the leader does die or is so dead, North Korea will hide this information for as long as possible."
95319,2020-09-28T02:17:34Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"I predict that there is a 10% chance that North Korea will announce a new head of state by 1 October 2020, based on the proximity of this prediction to that date and the implications of this announcement for North Korea. With October 1st being three days away as of this prediction, it is unlikely that a new head of state will be announced within that time if it has not already. Recent speculations about Kim Jong Un's health, leading to questions of a new head of state seem to be exaggerated. Statements by a South Korean news source that Kim Jong Un had undergone heart surgery in April were provided by a single unnamed source, and recent events suggest that he still has the capacity to act as the head of North Korea. On 24 September, Kim Jong Un gave a statement apologizing for the killing of a South Korean national by North Korean border guards, implying that he is still able to function as the leader of the North Korean state. It is possible that Kim Jong Un's health could rapidly collapse in the coming days, and according to Philip Tetlock's Superforecasting, over-reacting to evidence can lead to inaccurate predictions, so I believe a prediction less than 10% would be ignoring the possibility of rapid health deterioration."
95527,2020-09-28T02:08:34Z,1,[20.0],[20.0],"The reason i say 20% is because recently Kim-Jong-Un apologized for the killing of a South Korean citizen but that could just be a face to prevent other countries from stepping in and saying something to where more allies can be made on the premise of the ""victim"" mindset. North Korea does not like to show a face of weakness so this recent comment did come as a surprise."
95288,2020-09-28T02:07:17Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"I think it is impossible for North Korea to have a new head by October 1. The primary reason is because Kim Jong Un declared his sister, Kim Yo Jong, as second in command. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/8/20/kim-jong-uns-sister-now-de-facto-second-in-command-in-n-korea"
95301,2020-09-28T02:00:47Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],"Sources: No, there is a 15% chance that North Korea will announce that it has a new head of state before October 1 2020. North Korea has a long-standing history of attempting to uphold and present a powerful facade to perpetrate themselves as powerful and competitive with Western nations. The fountain of lies that spill from North Koreas dictator and staff as a fear-based reaction in order to appear bigger and more powerful than they really are. With this in mind, North Korea continuously lies to its people. Kim Jung Un is recognized as a living God in North Korea. The loss of their divine ruler would be crippling and represent a weak image for North Korea-seeing their most powerful rule fall from power. Rumors have risen due to the fact that North Koreas leader has made few public appearances in the past few months. Rumors regarding his health and current state cannot be confirmed solely because North Korea has yet to release any information that could possibly confirm or exploit any weaknesses that their ruler may have. This has been discussed in several articles, as the propaganda in North Korea is overwhelming. It is unlikely that North Korea would be quick to announce the death of their head of state to their people, and more importantly, the world. Having a long-standing reputation of standing upon a thrown of lies to portey a powerful façade for North Korea and its ruler, I believe there is a 15% chance they will announce a new head of state before October 1 2020, regardless of Kim Jung U"
95314,2020-09-28T01:52:49Z,1,[20.0],[20.0],"The reason I said that it would be 20% is because in North Korea, they rarely announce what is happening from a day to day bases. They control what information is let out and released. Two days ago Kim Jong un supposedly released a statement apologizing to the death of a South Korean officer. With that being said is he still is in power based on recent news articles."
95560,2020-09-28T01:48:50Z,1,[1.0],[1.0],"Judging how Kim Jung Un has resurfaced recently, questions of his health have quickly faded into the shadows. I think if a new leader were to arrive, he would be paraded around and shown off like a show pony in typical North Korean fashion."
95514,2020-09-28T01:48:01Z,1,[1.0],[1.0],Based off of the fact that North Korea would have just a few days to announce a new head of state I think it is very unlikely that it will not be happening before October 1. It is apparent that the death rumors were highly untrue and that Kim Jong Un is still alive and very much in control of North Korea. There is still so much secrecy that we do not know about Kim Jong Un and what has been happing with him in the last months which leads me to believe that they country is still trying to protect him and will no be name a new head of state any time soon. https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/kim-jong-un-appears-to-be-alive-after-all-so-how-did-his-death-make-the-news/2020/05/05/e9cf7f0e-8d6c-11ea-a0bc-4e9ad4866d21_story.html
95564,2020-09-28T01:41:07Z,1,[1.0],[1.0],"With only days left before the October 1st deadline, it is highly unlikely that North Korea will announce a new head of state. Previously, there had been speculation that Kim Jong-un was ill or deceased due to his absence from the global spotlight. Even the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had issued a statement saying that “we haven't seen him.” However, recent reports from Kim Jong-un from September 25th quote him issuing a personal apology for the killing of a South Korean official in the North’s waters. This break from his previous silence is evidence that he is at least alive and thus is sufficient evidence to say that he is still the acting head of state and will remain as the head of state."
95484,2020-09-28T01:00:39Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"I ultimately predicted a 100% chance that no new head of state would be announced before October 1st, 2020. My reasoning for this is that since the date is less than a week away, the chance of an announcement coming out before then is very low. Also, Kim Jong Un recently sent a personal letter to South Korean president Moon Jae-in in which he apologized for the recent North Korean killing of a South Korean citizen. That alone proves that he is still very much in charge of the North Korean government, and that there is little possibility that he will be deposed."
95316,2020-09-28T00:57:01Z,1,[3.0],[3.0],with Kim Jung Un resurfacing I find it highly unlikely that a new head of state will be announced any time soon. With all that has been happening with North Korea and the secrecy of Kim Jung Un's surgery and no official statement on who would be acting as his successor I feel as if it is safe to say that Kim Jung Un will remain the head of State for well into the future.
95304,2020-09-28T00:52:35Z,1,[1.0],[1.0],"I think its safe to say that they will not announce a new head of state in the next 3 days. There is always a chance but it wont happen.

95298,2020-09-28T00:18:10Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"Using the Delphi Method, my group and I have concluded that Kim Jung Un is still in power, and that he was just really sick when he was missing from public events. That is the reasoning behind giving a 0% chance that they will announce a new leader because there is no solidified evidence to suggest that Kim Jung Un has passed away, there is only evidence that he was very ill and missed many public events. so, in conclusion my group and I believe that Kim Jung Un is still in power however he just suffered illness due to poor eating habits and lifestyle choices."
95515,2020-09-28T00:09:02Z,1,[3.0],[3.0],"The main reason for the turmoil regarding whether or not there could possibly be a new head of state is Kim Jong-un was unaccounted for for about 3 months. Recently however, he was spotted scoping out new development in North Korea. Therefore, if Kim Jong-Un is perfectly healthy, there is no reason for a new head of state to be announced. If Kim Jong-un is sick, it is also improbable that they would announce his death, or impending death, as the people of North Korea see him as God. https://news.yahoo.com/north-koreas-kim-praises-army-223315223.html"

However, these allegations are false because after that accusation the leader was put back into the spotlight. If their leader was to die I do not predict that they will actually announce that they have a new head of state. If they tell the world they have a new state that cold lead other countries to invade the country or possibly invade the country and try to take the land over. I predict if their leader does die I predict the country will keep it low for a time until they can get a new leader and create a story for Kim Jong Un ""missing"" from the public eye."

Kim is literally viewed as a god in north Korea, the people there would go crazy if he were to die. Also, i think that when/if he dies it is going to be some crazy dramatical way to keep mind control over the people, that or they will make it political saying we killed him or something. He is not just going to disappear. South Korea has also been keeping us up to date and says he is not dead. North Korea just up and announcing a new head of state is not something i see happening."
95299,2020-09-27T20:44:34Z,1,[1.0],[1.0],"There was much speculation over Kim Jong Un’s disappearance. Many claimed that he was terminally ill, and or perhaps even deceased. Regardless of the speculations, Kim has frequently made a number of public appearances. His first appearance was at a newly completed fertilizer factory near Pyongyang back in May. Then, he reappeared at a meeting that discussed expanding the country’s nuclear war deterrence. With a number of appearances, South Korean intelligence also provided us with some insight into the matter. South Korean analysts stated that there was no significant information that proved Kim had undergone any form of surgery or medical procedure. South Korean officials discussed that Kim has focused on consolidating recent internal affairs and coronavirus concerns have limited his public activity. In conjunction, South Korean officials remind us that this is not the only time Kim has disappeared for an extended period. With all of the appearances, the South Korean intelligence, and only about three days left until October 1st; it is almost certain that North Korea will not announce a new head of state. https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-asia-52554612 https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/kim-jong-un-reappears-after-another-3-week-absence https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/03/south-korea-kim-jong-un-did-not-have-surgery-230177"

According to BBC News, “Kim Jong-un's appearance came amid rumours about his health and that he had delegated some of his authority to his sister Kim Yo-jong. Speculation about the health of the North Korean leader is not unusual but has so far always turned out to be false.” According to U.S. News, ““Kim Jong-un’s more frequent visits to the provinces are intended to show a ‘leader of the people’ response to natural disasters,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.” Also according to the book SUPERFORECASTING, “Of course each of these pockets of predictability can be abruptly punctured. A good restaurant is very likely to open its doors when it says it will, but it may not, for any number of reasons, from a manager sleeping late, to fire, bankruptcy, pandemic, nuclear war, or a physics experiment accidentally creating a black hole that sucks up the solar system.” I add this to also show that the only way for North Korea to have a new head of state is for something extraordinary to happen in order for it to happen. As you can see from the information provided above, Kim Jung Un appears to be alive and is being very active which leads me to stay with my prediction that there is a 0% chance of North Korea announcing a new head of state."

To me, there is a 80 decent chance that there will be a new head s state, due to the fact that there had been reporting that he is alive and well.

But it has been proven that he is in hiding due to the Corona Virus outbreak and multiple typhoons occurring on the peninsula. Although many believe him to be dead, he has been seen reviewing the damages of the Typhoons and publicly apologizing to South Korea for the death of an official on the border. I will give a one percent chance of him peeling over and dying due to his unhealthy lifestyle of excessive eating and smoking."

Our initial estimate was 85% no that North Korea will announce a new head of state by October 1, 2020. After the initial estimate, we began discussion into the matter. Before even doing research, we discussed that this date is less than a week away and that the probability of an announcement that large coming out is slim. Earlier this spring, major news outlets claimed that Kim Jong Un was dead, brain dead, and/or missing and that his sister would be taking over his dictatorship. CNN claimed that military intelligence said the leader was in “grave danger” after surgery on April 21, 2020. Since then, there have been very few reports of sightings of the dictator. Even if he were missing, this would not be advertised at all. As of September 24, the dictator had North Korean troops shoot a South Korean man who tried to cross the border. He is still active and kicking, only increasing our forecast into high probability that the announcement will not be made, even if his health is trashed at the moment. We settled for 100% confidence that no new head of state will be announced by October 1, 2020."

Secondly, the comeuppance of his sister does not necessarily prove that she is being primed to take over for two key reasons. In Confucian Korea, it is meant to be a man who leads due to the family structure of Korea, this has been the case since Kim Il-Sung. Also, her comeuppance may be linked to Kim needing people he can really trust, he has executed around 300 important people in recent years, and her appearance at the Winter Olympic Games in South Korea, where she ""stole the show"" according to South Korean media shows she can be an external propaganda asset to the Kim regime. Thirdly, it is unlikely that the regime would see a quick change of leader due to Kim Jong-un's health. If we look back, Kim Jong-Il defacto led the country for many years before the death of his father in 1994, it is likely that this North Korea would follow a similar cautious path because they prioritise regime survival above all else."

Dies of natural causes: 1-2% (estimated using South Korean Life Tables from the past 10 years with an estimated 5x increase in mortality risk due to supposed health issues + COVID) 2. Dies of unnatural causes: from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assassinated_and_executed_heads_of_state_and_government), I count 20 assassinations over past 30 years, which across all countries works out at 0.1% probability, though I would think higher chance in N Korea, so adjusting upwards to 0.2% 3. Removed by force (Coup or military action): From https://www.statista.com/chart/17701/number-of-successul-unsuccessful-coup-attempts/, 56 successful coups in 73 years = 77% chance of coup in a given year.

Other than on his death the chances of a new head of state being announced are unlikely. If Kim were incapacitated the historical precedent of his father continuing as head of state despite a stroke suggests there would be no impact. There does not appear to be any sign of a more general power struggle/movement to get rid of Kim which would be successful"

Hence, there are chances that a close relative (either his son, aged 10 or his sister) is being trained for the role in any event. Hence, the plan for succession must be in place. However, any announcements happen only in a case of eventuality. However, there will be indications for such grooming - probably, it could be his sister, young son, or wife..."

KCNA news agency reports that the North Korean leader cut the ribbon at the opening of a fertiliser factory. It adds that people at the factory ""broke into thunderous cheers of hurrah"" when he appeared. The reported appearance - his first since a state media appearance on 12 April - comes amid global speculation over his health. The latest reports from state media could not be independently confirmed and no pictures were provided”"

84321,2020-05-01T19:40:05Z,1,[32.0],[32.0],"It has now been over two weeks since Kim missed the ceremony to celebrate his grandfathers birthday and although there has been a slight pull back from initial rumors by several intelligence agencies around the world it still seems as if Kim is in critical condition. If Kim has died or does die soon, there is a chance that his sister could take his place but in the largely male dominate society of North Korea, I think it's unlikely that his senior advisors would give up power to his sister. Members in the Intelligence bureau of Taiwan cited the fact that China had been positioning slightly more aggressively with drills and military exercises and that there was a chance of future conflict. If Kim has died, it would be beneficial for China to fill the space of the power vacuum with a pro-china leader. I believe that once things are slightly confirmed there will be a power scramble between the US, China, South Korea, and Russia to establish some form of government and a favorable leader. yet all the rush will create long drawn out talks and no mans land of what to do. Furthermore If COVID is still causing massive impacts around the world we can expect this wait time to be even longer as countries struggle to overcome domestic problems before they look outward."

Reports from various intelligence agencies vary and do not unanimously confirm or deny the rumors, and some even suggest that Kim never underwent heart surgery in the first place. The canceling of events stems from the spread of COVID-19 and can not be directly connected to Kim’s rumored health status. According to Newsweek, in addition to the uncertainty of the rumors, Kim Jong Un has been known to step away from public view. As of April 2020, he has avoided public view on three separate occasions this year and was also absent for 27 days in 2019. Due to these facts, it is unlikely that North Korea will announce a new head of state, even in an acting capacity, within the next six months."

68240,2020-05-01T18:14:17Z,1,[20.0],[20.0],"Reports that Kim Jong-Un is dead from health complications relating to surgery are unconfirmed and the evidence in favor has not historically indicated that he has passed away. Other explanations for his absence include avoiding public events out of concern for COVID-19 and recovering from the surgery. A significant consideration is that defense sources say that Kim has been ""running his country normally"" (https://www.newsweek.com/north-korea-kim-jong-un-health-speculation-1500848). South Korean authorities are under pressure to keep people calm but if there was disturbing news one would expect some sign of preparedness from them. I estimate 10% chance that Un dies from surgery complications. Also, given the long window of this question and the potential for Corona induced stability which could also shake North Korea I add another 10% for a leadership change in that outcome."

DJT's words often are either wrong or some other version of questionable, but in this case I'd suggest that if the US IC has definitive information that KJU was alive and well, it wouldn't hurt for the Prez to say some version of ""hes' ok, trust me."" Since that was not the arc, I suspect things are complicated in the DPRK. FWIW"
