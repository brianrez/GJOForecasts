In the report, Mueller claims that at one point Trump even called White House lawyer Don McGahn in an attempt to remove him over ""conflicting interests"". Though Trump outright denies these claims, he also tweeted that, ""Bob Mueller should not testify, no redos for the Dems!"" Not only is there a great amount of incentive for Trump to find a way to remove Mueller from his role as Special Counsel, but he has taken similar actions before when he fired former FBI director James Comey.

I didn't go full knee-jerk to 100% or thereabouts because a lot can still happen. I'm downgrading my last estimate from 50% to 45% based on the passage of time (3/4 of a month out of 9.25 months at my last guess) with essentially no new information to suggest he's on his way out quickly. This is a tough one to call... with all the controversy over DJT's tax returns, we could easily see some new alarming change that solidifies Mueller's tenure for the foreseeable future, but just as easily he could be dismissed and it would be absorbed within a couple of news cycles as just one more outlandish thing this administration has managed to do... I think this is a coin flip type situation, but something has me leaning one way from the coin flip."

I suspect the Mueller report will contain a lot of evidence that Trump supports cronyism and tradition white collar criminal behavior and networks with those who thrive on it because they will all support each other (which is sufficiently clear without the Mueller report proving it). If so ending the Mueller investigation now would be a somewhat disappointing end for many Democrats and let Republicans move away from the siege against Trump and toward anything else more positive. Waiting to end the investigation, especially when there isn't any clear evidence that there is anything bigger than what's been made clear so far would increasingly justify Republican criticism of the investigation and it's political motivation and fuel conservative entrenchment into a pro-Trump camp rather than the more broad and diverse themes actually present across conservative-leaning voters. That said, I honestly think Mueller doesn't care and will hold out as long as he has real evidence to pursue. The only possible thing that could be better politically for anti-Trump Democrats might be that Mueller keeps pulling threads and following them painstakingly and agonizingly slowly until it actually outlasts the next election cycle, which would be extraordinary. I think there isn't enough evidence of anything to bring charges against Trump directly in a Ken Starr/Clinton way, which is what kept Starr around so long. There is definitely room for the report to be made and Mueller to stay put as Special Counsel, but there would have to be something clear (and clearly related to Russia) to make that happen."

I've been following this saga from a distance, not being American nor living in North America, but with some interest (the whole story is fascinating from a certain point of view). I don't want to be swayed too much by recent news or subjective feelings, but I have a strong suspicion that the process will take a long time to unwind, one way or another. I am basing this ""gut feel"" reaction and update on the recent arrest of Roger Stone. When I think of the number of arrests and indictments, I can't help but imagine it will take a very long time to finish this process, regardless of the outcome with respect to the primary intent of Mueller's mandate. So, I feel like his mandate will carry on at least another couple of years, with no better than 25% chance he is out of the position by the end of 2019. I admit this guess is based far more on emotion and feelings than evidence, information and data."

66692,2019-01-14T16:37:43Z,1,[60.0],[60.0],"I see three ways Mueller will cease to be Special Counsel: he dies or suffers debilitating illness or injury (so he cannot continue); he voluntarily leaves the position; or, he involuntarily leaves the position. There are (at least) two ways he could leave voluntarily: He will have completed the assignment, issued the report and initiated any needed legal action; or, he will choose to leave with the job unfinished, for unknown reasons (frustration, coercion by foreign agents or organized crime, etc). There are several ways he could leave involuntarily: the President could order his dismissal; the Deputy AG or AG could order his dismissal; or, he could have some public misstep where he breaks a law (or appears to) and is forced out by Congress, US SC, or the like. I will start with voluntary alternatives, which I think have the highest chance. Since he has been at the job for two years without finishing, the expected completion duration is another 2 years (see Lindy rule in Taleb's Skin in the Game), although I think the probabilities are front loaded to some degree. I think there's a 55% chance he will have completed his work within the next year, and leave voluntarily. The chances of leaving voluntarily for other reasons strike me as vanishingly small and don't affect my estimate. According to actuarial tables, he has about a 3.5% chance of dying in the next year (as a 74-75 year old man), and I will round up to 5% allowing for some grave injury or illness. This puts my base estimate at about 60% (granted that straight addition of 55+5 isn't strictly correct). What strikes me as far less certain is the chance he could be forced to leave by the President or others. This could happen, theoretically, but I have a hard time imagining anyone taking that step for the President, no matter how bullet-proof they see themselves. I think it's very unlikely he will be forced out. I'm settling on 60% chance as a first estimate, and I qualify that by saying it will be because he will have completed his assignment to his satisfaction, more likely to be closer to the end of the year, rather than earlier."

Republicans - Many seem to think the final report will be damaging but not an existential threat to Trump so they can spin it to their advantage Mueller - By all accounts a by-the-book guy who will want this wrapped up as quickly as appropriate so as not to be tainted by being further politicized as the presidential campaigns ramp up. It is insightful too to note that he referred so many non-core findings to other agencies all along for them to investigate rather than ever expanding the scope of his teams work ... he doesn't want to run a perpetual investigation. Trump - Every time I think I understand his thinking I end up being wrong so I should go against what makes sense to me here but I'll stick with wrapping up being good for him. He'll make claims about proof of no collusion no matter what the report says. It seems to me (again my track record thinking like Trump is very poor) that since he hasn't blown up the investigation already he must truly believe it can't end his presidency so he should want it to end to spin the outcome.

65859,2019-01-07T04:29:46Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],Mueller will complete his report in 2019 but will remain as Special Counsel to defend conclusions in 2020. I do not think he will be fired by 45 at this point. Too many ways now for information to be released to the public thereby reducing Trumps incentive to dismiss and consequently draw even more negative press and backlash.

66003,2019-01-07T03:53:40Z,1,[82.0],[82.0],The investigation should be complete by the end of 2019....Mueller is secure at this time
66028,2019-01-07T03:50:51Z,1,[45.0],[45.0],It should finish this year but may go longer than we think.
66012,2019-01-07T03:48:27Z,1,[51.0],[51.0],"Two reasons. First, I think Mueller knows it will lose credibility if it doesn't reach some kind of closure before then. He'll probably make sure it triggers appropriate civil and criminal cases as by-products and shut down the high-profile stuff. I bet there's one big revelation just before that. Second, I'm sick of it."

66011,2019-01-07T03:16:33Z,1,[55.0],[55.0],Hopefully he will have summited his findings before then.

I had the opportunity to inform the Democratic Party way ahead of time before Donald Trump was running for office. i wanted to make a call to Barack Obama, and to warn them of the doom. I seen all of it coming, the firing of James Comey, Flynn, Paul Manifort, the collusion, the money laundering, absolutely all of it, when I googled the White House phone number, I slammed the computer when I seen the last digits 1111. This is one of those predictions that I can not interfere in, You just have to “let it be”. Just like “tree of life”, the “orlando massacre”, the “Vegas shooting” and the rest of the Chaos that unfolds. I know things, I see things, I hear things that nobody else knows. it’s not a question of when his report will be complete, but if the republicans will have enough spine to stand up, and say Donald Trump has done enough damage, and he has to go. It all depends on which way they want to take it, impeach, or wait for an indictment, lol, perhaps both, lol. Between Russia money, the Saudis money, and money from China, wow, there is enough to pull this mofo down once and for all. I did tell MY Government of the message I got in December of 2017, and it was a message for all of Humanity. I wrote down Hawaii 50, and told them it was a warning,,,,,those were my exact words. 3 weeks later, the Missle alert button was accidentally pushed in Hawaii. I am sure the shutdown will ultimately take him down though, just too many bad decisions being made. he should have a team of psychiatrists working with him, and perhaps take him out in a straight jacket, lol. ha, ha. but then what would Kushner, and Jr. do. though I think it will be part of a bargaining tool to not go after his corrupt family. I hope Mueller at least takes down Kushner. He got money from The Saudi’s. This is how he was able to keep his 666 tower afloat in NYC, hence the arms deal he kept alive for the Saudis. YIKES, did I mention 666, and tied to the Israel’s, what in the World, ohh my."

65216,2019-01-06T19:13:09Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],Only after he has reported !
65354,2019-01-06T19:13:09Z,1,[8.0],[8.0],The house will get their bill passed

65269,2019-01-06T19:12:41Z,1,[50.0],[50.0],He will complete his report and turn over the prosecution of cases during 2019.
65280,2019-01-06T19:12:37Z,1,[55.0],[55.0],I think he will complete his investigation by that time.
65338,2019-01-06T19:12:16Z,1,[70.0],[70.0],I think there is a lot more to be done
65206,2019-01-06T19:12:13Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],It would be the one thing that Americans would be willing to revolt against.

65124,2019-01-06T19:11:00Z,1,[35.0],[35.0],I like to think that Trump understands the danger of firing Mueller. And the special counsel most likely still has plenty of work to do.

65288,2019-01-06T19:09:27Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],He will be working for at least 6 more months on investigation issues and then writing his report to the AG. I think he will hold the title for about 14-18 months.

A final report to DoJ recommending to prosecute or not by end of 2019 - 30% with House Dems request of 6 months to review perjury. Chance of recommended indictment - 80%, Chance of prosecution 20%, chance of Mueller prosecuting 5% - so overall rate is about 18% that it will conclude by 2020 with Mueller on this pathway 2. Mueller is fired for misconduct - chance 5% - only in the event of staffer mistake plus DoJ executive shift and political during 2019 3. Rosenstien lets it expire at end of fiscal year 2019 - doubtful that this is politically viable - esp as House requests investigation review of perjury during House testimony 4. Rosenstien decides to close the investigation before end of 2019 - 5% 5. He could be sick/tired and resign as with Whitewater - 5%"

64592,2019-01-06T17:45:39Z,1,[100.0],[100.0],He will finalize his investigation long before that

64874,2019-01-06T17:44:31Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],Mueller will begin to provide more and more indictments and evidence which will strengthen his position as SC.

64895,2019-01-06T17:43:35Z,1,[45.0],[45.0],The investigation will need to wind up in mid-2019 to give the Dems time to use the report to slowly twist the knife in all the House Hearings into Corruption and Foreign interference that will lead up to the 2020 election. I think Mueller will hold the title of Special Council until fall of 2019 and a this point the damage to the Trump Administration is done so Trump has no good reason to get rid of him.
64891,2019-01-06T17:43:19Z,1,[95.0],[95.0],He will complete his report in early 2019. That is his assignment and his status as special counsel will terminate when its' done. Any criminal cases generated during the investigation will continue.

64875,2019-01-06T17:30:32Z,1,[50.0],[50.0],I hope so because he has accomplished nothing meaningful at this stage. Very negative overall for americans as a whole and to a President that has accomplished so much in a short time.

60606,2019-01-06T17:22:48Z,1,[50.0],[50.0],The investigation may be over or the shmuck in the White House might fire him.
64751,2019-01-06T17:22:41Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],He will get too close to investigating the president and the republican congressmen will not support Mueller any longer.
64556,2019-01-06T17:20:32Z,1,[50.0],[50.0],A report must be issued

64269,2019-01-06T17:16:55Z,1,[85.0],[85.0],His investigation is too important to stop. The only way it will stop is if Trump is convicted of his numerous crimes against the world.

64793,2019-01-06T17:11:25Z,1,[85.0],[85.0],There is a race against time. Delaying the Special Counsel report into 2020 would impede the Presidential primaries and would therefore be seen as tainting the political process. There is a slight chance that the Mueller findings will be so fundamental to the US political system that the Special Counsel could continue into 2020.
