While the Philippines are a majority Catholic, I don't see this as ultimately effective since the elements of the church have thrown their support behind candidates before. With a more than 20 point lead, I don't see the clergy's support as sufficient for a win though they may cut the margin of victory by a few percentage points."

Moreno and Pacquiao both have fame on their side; the former an actor and the latter a boxer. It's hard to gauge how important religion is for the average voter.
