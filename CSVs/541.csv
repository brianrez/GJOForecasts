A 34% or greater y/y growth happened 8 times in the last 12 months but only 6 times in the decade prior. The recent jumps can be strongly corelated to the pandemic and the threat to restrictions under the Biden administration. Prior to that there was a surge in the winter of 2015/16 following the San Bernadino shooting and increased talk of restrictions under the Obama administration. Pre-pandemic baseline would have been 5% and that momentum appears to be waning. That said, I'll still bump it up slightly to 7% with the caveat that an extreme event (large mass shooting) would significantly increase this probability."

I think I gave too much credence to the recent huge spike in my prior forecast, though it was difficult to say where it would stop.

There was a similar spike in 2008/9 after a Democrat was elected president (and/or financial crisis?), but started earlier (Nov). If we used 2008/9 as a model, the jump was roughly 50% for two months, then stayed up about 30% for about 4 months. In 2020/21, there was also a 50% (roughly) jump, but in January (preceded by more of a ramp-up too, so not the same shape already), which would imply something like 30% above the 3Mish level for Apr-Jun. 3.5 to 3.9 M per month for 3 months gives 10.5 - 11.7 total. But, given coming out of a pandemic and economic slump rather than going deeper in, increased political polarization, and 12.5 for the prior three months, breaking 12M seems very plausible, if slightly less likely than the 11.6M which is my best guess."

If we assume that 2021 follows a similar trajectory as 2013, the only year with a similar annual increase in January, background checks would drop to half in June. This would result in a similar forecast of 8 - 9 million. There were also more background checks in January and February 2013 than from April to June 2013. Reasons that there could be more background checks are fear of more gun regulation under Biden [ https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/03/gun-sales-background-check-legislation-back-congress/6906980002/ ] and a general compounding effect where everyone wants to get a gun because everyone else has one.

Past sales are thus likely a bad and less reliable indicator for future sales and checks, the more so that a moderating new WH administration is finally in place and working. I expect an increased level by 300,000 to 400,000 units in April, May v. 2020, while I expect a drop in June. Hunting season and major weapon shows and trade fairs (that are likely an important factor for a decision to buy, but likely suspended for the time being) will have an effect over Summer 2021, but I suppose it's hard to quantify and it's only a minor share of total sales, thus June will probably see the highest sales and checks of all three months under consideration."
