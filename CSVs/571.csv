Overall, lots of activity. Not sure if it means Sarmat is more or less likely. https://thebulletin.org/premium/2021-03/nuclear-notebook-russian-nuclear-weapons-2021/ “Russia is also developing the heavy SS-29, or Sarmat (RS-28), which will begin replacing the SS-18 (RS-20V) at Uzhur in 2021 or 2022. Three ejection tests were conducted in December 2017, March 2018, and May 2018 at the Plesetsk Space Center, involving cold launch and test firing of the Sarmat’s first stage and booster engine. These tests were originally scheduled for 2016 but were delayed because of difficulties that appeared during the missile’s strength tests. The closing test stages, which will include a test launch with the 62nd Missile Division at Uzhur, was supposed to be completed by the end of 2020; however, this has been delayed, likely due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. In December 2020, Defense Minister Shoigu suggested that Sarmat flight tests would take place during the summer of 2021 at the new Severo-Yeniseysky proving ground (Russian Federation 2020a). Following the success of these tests, Sarmat will officially be handed over to the military and serial production will begin. As of March 2020, Sarmat’s industrial production line has apparently completed all the necessary upgrades to prepare for serial production, which is expected to begin in 2021, barring any unforeseen delays (TASS 2020c; Safronov and Nikolsky 2019).“"

Based on former president Trump's stance on the treaty as less important than a threat from China, Russian leadership may be in a tough political situation knowing it is at a disadvantage in current deployed arsenals (appearance of perceived equality) which makes a credible test of the RS-28 more favorable.
