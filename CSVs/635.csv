Tom Brady is in fourth with 36 touchdowns and would need to throw for 8 in his next game. The NFL record for touchdown passes in a game is 7, meaning he is out based on past statistics. Mahomes has nothing to play for, with the Chiefs having clinched the AFC regular season title and a first round bye so he will most likely be sitting. Russell Wilson and the Seahawks still have a shot at the #1 seed in the NFC, as do the Packers, so I expect both QBs to play. Unless a major statistical anomaly occurs (Rodgers throws for 0 TDs - only occurred once this year) and Wilson throws for at least 6, maybe 7 (which would be an NFL record he would tie) to pass Rodgers, Rodgers is the winner. In fact, Wilson has only thrown for 5 TDs in a game twice this season, and that was weeks 2 and 3 before defenses started figuring out their tactics."
