The Bloomberg economist surveys indicate most economists say that stimulus will not become an issue this year. The bank thinks that the economy will have an upward improvement next year and will discuss the issue then if the economy does not meet the 2% goal of inflation in Japan or if the bonds do not put stronger pressure on the economy and improve it. They do not have much latitude with issuing another stimulus to the economy due to the amount in its prior release. There are other sources that indicate the trend, but Bloomberg represents the forecast in a way where it is not necessary to write a redundant and a longer citation page. References"

Someone else said they need reform, which is true, but not politically easy and should already have been done but hasn't, and leadership isn't changing, w/ Abe around for awhile still. Even if they do execute structural reform, easing should be done in conjunction until it appears deflation has been avoided and some semblance of inflation arrives. The world is basically already in or entering a recession now, so Japan needs some sort of easing. So the BOJ can take interest rates negative or increase equity purchases, or both, if it wants to ease. I think they need to ease monetarily somehow. So the question for me basically is whether they will buy more equities or not before the end of the year. However, if they purchase equities, this will probably be done through the GPIF, which is not technically the BOJ. So this makes my choice very easy.

A stronger yen and further economic slowdown in China would heighten the probability of a reduction in the BOJ’s interest rate on excess reserves, Kono said. “Speculation for further stimulus will strengthen when the yen rises,” Kono said. “In that case, there is a possibility of cutting the interest rate on excess reserves rather than expanding bond buying.” BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda (ever the optimist) said Friday that consumer prices are rising about 1.1 percent when energy costs are excluded.
