However, most recently, Sanders has been experiencing an upward trend in the polls whereas Biden is experiencing a downward trend in the polls. Similarly, but on a smaller scale, Warren is experiencing a slight upward trend whereas Buttigieg is experiencing a slight downward trend. Based on this data from the most recent polling- most trends last at least a week. Therefore I expect that by the New Hampshire primary next week, not much should change in terms of trends. That is why I place a lower percentage on Warren and Buttigieg and I place a higher percentage for winning the primary on Sanders and Biden with the prediction that Sanders still has a higher chance of winning than Biden as based on current trends."

Slightly different perspective than I’d seen previously but ties a couple points together. FYI only “The Democratic Party is yet to hold its first presidential primary, but many would-be nominees have already surged, sagged or dropped out altogether. Joe Biden has been the front-runner ever since pollsters started asking primary voters about their intentions. But just behind him, there has been plenty of movement. Elizabeth Warren had a surge in the autumn, nearly but not quite catching Mr Biden; she has since fallen back. Next to enjoy a bounce was Pete Buttigieg, who benefited from Ms Warren’s declining popularity among college-educated whites. His numbers have now slid a bit and Bernie Sanders is doing better. What explains these ups and downs? Almost all of the variation in support for the different Democratic candidates so far can be traced to movement among white voters, particularly college-educated ones. According to YouGov’s survey for The Economist of Democrats who say they intend to vote in the primaries, the group has oscillated wildly between support for Ms Warren, Mr Sanders and Mr Buttigieg. This has been the main group supplying Mr Biden’s chief competitors—Mr Sanders and Ms Warren—with enough votes to be contenders. Ms Warren pulled in support from over 20% of college-educated whites at the start of the campaign, and currently wins nearly 30% of them. Mr Sanders has recently become the leading choice of whites without a degree. Non-white Democratic voters, by contrast, have been much more stalwart in their support for Mr Biden, especially those without college degrees. They have grown only more inclined to the former vice-president as the more progressive candidates have swapped places behind him. This is, on the face of it, odd. During President Donald Trump’s administration, white, liberal Democrats have become much more sensitive to racial injustice than they were when Barack Obama was president. You can see this in their increased awareness of racial discrimination as a barrier to economic and social progress. Yet when it comes to casting a vote in the primaries, they have avoided non-white candidates. They also favour more radical policies than do African-Americans. It used to be labour unions that acted as a counterweight to left-wing social movements within the Democratic coalition. Now it seems that African-Americans are playing that role. Without them, Ms Warren or Mr Sanders, not Mr Biden, would probably be the favourite.“"

While it shows Sanders with a wide margin, the poll combines both individuals who both currently support a candidate or are ""leaning"" toward a candidate. The leaning voters could easily change their mind. Prior recent polling (without leaning factored in) shows a much closer race, with a large segment still undecided. Results in Iowa, where recent polls are few and appear to indicate a tighter race, could influence NH voters to a certain extent. Nevertheless, Sanders won by a large margin in 2016 and he is well-known in New Hampshire. The difference, however, was there were really only 2 viable candidates in 2016--Sanders and Clinton. Sanders consistently led in polling averages in the month leading up to the primary by 8-10 points, with increasing support as the election neared. He ultimately won 60/38%. Here, on the other hand, 4 candidates make the assessment more complicated, as Biden and Sanders carry less than 50% support (about 40-45%) between the two of them, with Warren and Buttigieg garnering close to 30%. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-6276.html Since the NH primary is only a week after the Iowa caucus, it seems unlikely that any of the four will drop out unless they do incredibly poorly. We can thus expect a fairly divided support. Buttigieg has surged recently, and some of the other policy questions reveal an independent streak in voters that he could appeal to."

All this could add up to a Biden win as that’s who the DNC want to win. Sanders has the target on his back but is better at defending himself than the others (Warren also good in this regard). Admit polls show only a slight lead for Sanders. He and Buttigieg are the only ones generating real enthusiasm IMO although Warren does it in a technocratic, and sometimes gender-centric way. Nationally latest polls show Biden would beat Trump by widest margin, followed closely by Sanders. Just like Clinton polling at one point “last time”. Bottom line: still think Sanders has the chops. Admit it will be close. And I doubt there will really be a knockout winner in either Iowa or New Hampshire."
