31450,2017-03-28T15:34:39Z,1,[88.0],[88.0],I believe this deal is likely to be approved because the people now overseeing the review have a friendlier view of free markets and distrust government interference. There are caveats because these reviews can take a long time and there is no guarantee the review will be completed by October. According to a Forbes article the average length of time for an intensive DOJ review is now 10 months and AT&T reported in early January that the DOJ started the process. I think this means the deal is approved before October but not much before. http://fortune.com/2015/06/08/merger-approvals/ https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2017-01-06/at-t-doj-requested-in-depth-time-warner-review

A precedent is Comcast's merger with NBC Universal, which was allowed to go ahead and where the industries of the respective companies were similar and it was also a vertical merger. If the issue is competition in streaming services then its a no-brainer that the deal goes ahead, the competition is growing all the time in that space with YouTube TV the latest entrant. Timeline could pose problems, but the first 30 day review was done in November, so once they get the documents from both companies, the DOJ should reach a preliminary decision in another 30 days, after which some possible adjustments to the terms might still have to be made. http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2017/02/28/heres-what-the-at-t-time-warner-deal-faces-along.html http://seekingalpha.com/article/4052021-t-time-warner-deal-blocked-doj-believe-hype https://www.forbes.com/sites/larrydownes/2017/03/06/youtube-tv-improves-outlook-for-att-time-warner-merger/#5f2c38d3e597"

If history is an indication, Trump will still complain, but will likely be overruled by more established administration officials. Sending Kushner to talk with Time Warner executives suggests CNN will be asked to soften it's coverage on Trump as a bribe for not siccing the DOJ on the merger. The trade-off could be as easy as cutting down on critics' air time, bringing in Trump confederates as opposed to surrogates. I think this is bordering on fairly unsupported conspiracy theory territory, but if Trump can install a favorable pundit onto CNN, and he can brag about said pundit in a tweet while still criticizing CNN, he will consider it a win and be convinced to let it go. Any situation where he gets retribution and can claim victory will be sufficient for DOJ to stay out of it."

An unsubstantiated rumor places President Trump against the merger. Senator Al Franken is also calling for a review. Given the statements (or rumored statement in Trump's case) these two powerful opponents may provide bi-partisan encouragement the DOJ to increase the DOJ review process. Until there are positive signs that the DOJ is opting for a speedy review process I opt to place a low to moderate probability of the deal being approved.
