She primarily appeals to women voters and is very popular among democrats. However, Hillary has received continuous backlash with her past statements and actions as well as her current standing under the Benghazi issue. Sanders is accumulating votes left and right for his strong integrity as well as appeal to the younger generation. All in all Sanders should be favored over Clinton."

Next are “someone who cares about people like me” and experience, at just more than a quarter each. Only about one in 10 are choosing “electability” as the top attribute. In Iowa, Sanders won with honesty and empathy voters, Clinton on experience and electability. Far more New Hampshire voters see Sanders as honest and trustworthy than Clinton, and they feel he shares their values more so than she does. Nearly seven in 10 voters in the Democratic primary describe themselves as liberals, including a quarter who say they’re very liberal, both up from 2008, when 56 percent identified as liberal and 20 percent said they were very liberal. If they hold, those would be new highs in exit polls back to 1980.' Early assessment says NH will go strongly for Sanders. Adjusting accordingly."

If you win big in those towns, every college student and professor in New Hampshire cannot help your opponent. Also true that in the larger towns, it is much easier to get people to the polls, just because you don't have to drive twenty miles through the snow to get to the house of one voter. Clinton has the money and staff to organize This Sort of Thing, so I've gone back to betting against the polls."

In the final contest, the mainstream USA electorate will nominate the candidate that is: 1) more or less centrist. 2) electable.

If anything Clinton and Sanders SHOULD be polling close based on the Iowa entrance polls and 2008 New Hampshire exit polls breakdown of voter attitudes toward their political orientation (very liberal, somewhat liberal, moderate, etc.). Historically, NH has almost always voted for the moderate candidate as well, with the exception of Paul Tsongas in 1992. Given that Tsongas was from Massachusetts, it may simply be the regional unity of New England trumps the politics of any given candidate. Certainly, there is a lot of evidence that New England bucks political identity - one need only look at Sanders own election as an independent socialist as well as the litany of interesting candidates out of Maine including Susan Collins, Olympia Snowe and Paul LePage that don't fit the national party's mold.

It tells you everything you need to know,” said one Democratic strategist. “That this [challenge from Sanders] is real and they’ve got to be freaking out.” The attack caught many Democrats, including Sanders and his supporters, by surprise. ... Many Democrats are puzzled that the Clinton campaign would open up a front against Sanders on healthcare, arguing that the questions the campaign is raising over how he intends to pay for his plan resemble Republican talking points. Furthermore, Sanders’s desire for a single-payer system is wildly popular among the grassroots liberals who are key in the early-voting states."""

Whether democrats trend toward Clinton in Iowa will depend in considerable political machine in the state and how much the perception of Sanders as a socialist affects caucusing for his positions. Socialism (viewed from an American perspective among the electorate) has always been a negative in any electoral race. States such as New Hampshire and Vermont, and possibly in Seattle, Washington has gain considerable traction among left of center democratic voters. However, I doubt that this traction among democratic and independent voters can overcome the influence of 'ethnic voters'. The recent trending in deportation proceedings and removal of illegal/undocumented 'aliens' within the country could potentially spell disaster for democrats. The question of how much it influences the ethnic vote (particularly among hispanic voters) along with recent immigrants who identify religiously as Muslim shift the outcome in New Hampshire in either direction. However, Clinton in my view holds the advantages of a strong political infrastructure; this however does not necessarily translate into a win. Sanders does hold advantage as a known within the region among the electorate that simply want a different institutional manifestation of its politics."

He will have enough support and money to continue campaigning until New Hampshire. Although he is older, he seems in good health. He enjoys the campaign and is in it to make a point not necessarily to win. New Hampshire seems to vote for the ultimate candidate about 50% of the time. When the candidate seems certain (eg. 1952) they don't mind bucking the establishment. When they vote against the ultimate candidate, it is often for a candidate from the Northeast.

The Democrats told her no last time she tried to achieve her political aspirations. Why anyone in this country thinks her chances are any better baffles me. There are no reasons to believe that she is the best and/or only candidate for the Democrats. What has changes for the better in her bid for office? Nothing good as I see it.
