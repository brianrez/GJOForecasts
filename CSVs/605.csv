Facebook’s Libra, which it now calls Diem, is an example of a stablecoin. “The potentially fast and wide adoption of a global stablecoin, potentially a global currency governed only by the incentives of a private company, is something that will deserve and will receive the highest level of regulatory expectations,” Powell said. “Private stablecoins are not going to be an appropriate substitute for a sound monetary system based in central bank money.” https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/3/22/highly-volatile-powells-not-so-cryptic-warning-of-crypto https://www.coindesk.com/thailand-central-bank-terra-stablecoin-tht"

97443,2020-12-24T13:32:02Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],I think that Finma will allow Libra/Diem to trade and that Stablecoin will be a reality. That is why I am putting the likelihood as 75% for my first guess. What I don't know is how long it usually tales for Finma to make a decision. I think that Diem will be ready to launch as soon as it is allowed to and that the decision should take less than 1 year. LoL I need to investigate how long Finma takes to reach a decision and I know that they are working in collaboration with other international financial institutions so that may take more time than a year. I should probably have started at 50/50 but I cant help thinking that if something is inevitable then why wait so long to legislate?
