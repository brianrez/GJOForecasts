For 2016, we expect cash generation to decline as a consequence of lower Brent prices as compared to the $52 per barrel average in 2015. This is credit negative considering the $15 billion in capital expenditures planned for the year (down from an average of $23 billion in 2012-14), as per our expectations. PDVSA’s cash balance was roughly $5.8 billion as of December, 2015 but has presumably declined with the lower oil price in the first part of the year and limited access to external financing. http://blogs.barrons.com/emergingmarketsdaily/2016/10/28/bond-swap-for-venezuelas-pdvsa-delays-default-risk-for-now/ _____________________________ COMMENT: I believe there is another payment coming up in November.

The current government is hoping that oil prices will continue to rebound over the next year enough to keep the company and the government solvent. The fact that the debt which was exchanged was due in April and November of next year is a signal that they have the assets to continue making payments their scheduled bond payments for the next 6 months or so, though it gets more murky after that. Presumably the deal pushes any chance of default into 2018, though this is surely dependent on the price of oil."

If it is then presumably this question will be answered as ""yes"" before 1 Feb.

Maduro's approval rating is less than 25% ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-idUSKCN10Q28M) among shortages of basic goods and extremely high inflation. If he stays in power Venezuela is likely to continue to make debt payments as long as they have the liquidity to do so. If he is somehow removed from power the new government would likely use default to restructure their debt."

Trusting the article completely ""The government is due to make $1.5 billion in foreign debt payments in the second half of this year. Include PDVSA’s tab and the figure swells to $5.8 billion."" This is half their current ""hard currency reserves down to just $12 billion"". I am assuming that they'll pay this years. I imagine there to be some tricky snicky payment in Jan that will cause much chin scratching if oil goes back down (reason 1), or if whoever is getting these returns changes side etc (reason 2 as per article). From what I recall of this q last time, not making the payment has a lag time of a month or so before it can be deemed a default by those that didnt get paid. I think it was @dada who was the expert on this piece of wriggle room. However, leaving myself some ah! room, its volatile and so not assured. This story is probably on the increase which may perversely decrease unrest as at least they have supplies, http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36722422. It may not though, and be a catalyst for a movement of some sort."

Looking at sites like Barrons's and The Economist there are estimates of a default this year from 45-76%. Probably the biggest risk are the $2-3 Bn PDVSA repayments this autumn and they are trading at 56c on the dollar. The oil price is up about 70% since some of the direst predictions were made. They have sold approx 1/3 of their gold since repatriating it (which is alarmingly fast) but that leaves 2/3, currently valued at $12bn and would seem to be enough to push this issue into next year at least. They can probably sell PDVSA assets in the US like parts of Citgo to raise cash and either as sovereign or PDVSA they could probably re-negotiate terms with China although they may regret what they have to give up long term in return."

The Andean nation will cut purchases of overseas goods to about $20 billion from $37 billion in 2015, Vice President for Economic Policy Miguel Perez Abad said last week. The reduction means Venezuela will have enough cash to honor its bond payments in 2016, according to Eurasia Group and EMSO Asset Management. Eurasia had predicted the country could halt debt payments this year in the face of low oil prices and the worst recession in decades. Swaps traders now put the chances Venezuela will default over the following year at 63 percent, down from 83 percent in February. But while chopping imports is bolstering the country’s ability to pay debt, it’s making life harder for Venezuelans contending with empty supermarket shelves and the world’s fastest inflation, forecast to rise to close to 500 percent this year by the International Monetary Fund."

Basically the black and white situation is something like this. 2016 will see Venezuela pay around $10bn of debt. Numbers are not very clear but this is the ballpark. Now reserves (liquid) it seems are about $13bn. However, the CAD deficit is somewhere close to $20bn for the year. Now the math is obviously gone nuts. So a default is very very likely. Unless, oil recovers, and fast. Or the government changes its socialist policies, fast. Neither looks likely to me. It's a sad state of affairs, and a sad situation. But honestly, with CDS itself trading north of 60%, think the default is more than priced in, and expected. This is of course, over and above a 26-30% debt yield + recent bond issuances of deep discount bonds, that got sold at a third of their parity."

The US has since 2005 implemented several policies (promotion of blending petrol with ethanol, promoting the use of more fuel efficient vehicles) that are reducing its demand.

To be clear, this is true of any sovereign debtor, or any debtor generally. Venezuela's situation is perhaps unique among sovereigns, however, in that its willingness to pay seems to far outstrip its ability to pay. Contrast this situation to Argentina under CFK; despite having more than sufficient resources to pay the holdouts - especially once additional hard currency funds that could be raised via capital markets are considered - CFK chose to wage a decade long war to avoid making good on its obligations.

I still believe there is a strong preference to continue to live up to the debt obligations. It seems that the government feels its a strike against the socialist foundation that was set up by the still very popular Chavez. Its as if Chavez was still in power this would not be the situation but Maduro was the hand picked successor -- so, they continue to hope. Clearly things are very bad in most of the country but the stalemate continues between congress and the president and I don't see any upcoming debt maturities that might create a significant event. The oil revenue continues to roll in -- not enough to cover the whole socialist bill but enough to muddle along. So my forecast is half of the probability to default because of the lack of refinancing needs in the next 12 months and the governments preference to pay."

He may be; no one has so far accused him of excessive contact with reality. Big question is when. I think sooner than later.

He weakened the legislative branch in an effort to slow a reform agenda. Although transparency is non-existent, I don't believe the current price of oil is delivering the required amount to run the socialist economy. Venezuelans are being impacted in their daily lives -- shortages of basic products and the erosion of disposable incomes. Either oil prices have to rise or there has to be a cut back."
23157,2016-03-28T18:41:48Z,1,[70.0],[70.0],There seems to be deep structural corruption issues - the Swiss banks handing over records doesn't happen every day - and it does not seem like the price of oil is increasing at a rate that would allow Petroleos de Venezuela SA to overcome its issues or that the political situation in Venezuela will become more stable any time soon. My uncertainty stems from the timeline - I think it may take longer than a year for this to happen - but I think it is likely to happen.

Also, with oil looking up, this optimism is likely to be considered by creditors in pushing Venezuela to the wall. Still, it is a volatile environment out there. I will consider Moody's ratings for PDVSA, and up it by 15% given the country's political/macroeconomic landscape"

There are other mitigating factors may delay an inevitable default, including a regression-to-the-mean change in oil prices. It is still unclear whether oils price changes are durable and based on systemic changes in production or shorter term demand shifts. Additionally, China is likely to attempt to protect its 5bil loan already invested in PDVSA. PDVSA and Venezuela's finance issues are systemic and structural, and default is likely, however the time horizon of such a default is the primary variable. It is likely, given historical correlaries, that the Venezuelan government will likely raid all other funding sources before defaulting on debt, thus cutting off foreign investment and the government's ability to fund its operations. PDVSA has large debt maturities due in 16, 17, and 18 but is likely to make all attempts to push those maturities farther out.

Insufficient access to dollars, price controls, and rigid labor regulations have led some US and multinational firms to reduce or shut down their Venezuelan operations.

Several recent articles has offered contrarian takes as to why default is less likely than the market thinks (mostly because default will be a disaster for a country that needs to export oil). At the same time, the Maduro govt barely scraped by their February payment and there is little relief in site. The Venezuelan government has prioritized debt payments over many other things and that attitude will likely continue. However, they may just run out of money. Foreign reserves, including gold, can only pay for about 8-10 more months of imports at the bare-bones levels."
