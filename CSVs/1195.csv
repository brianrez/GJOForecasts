Since then states enacted additional incentives for the propping up of the electric vehicle market and jump start the alternative fuel vehicle economy. The side effect of this was lower revenue to the states via gasoline taxes which were not collected by an increasing all-electric vehicle fleet on the streets. Illinois and other states are considering huge increases in the annual registration fees for electric vehicles to augment the lost revenue from uncollected gasoline taxes. Trump has already announced he does not support extending the tax credits from the 2008 act beyond the existing parameters. Though legislation has been proposed to extend this tax incentive, it seems to be more of a election-cycle parlor game without much broad political appeal with legislatures and not much mainstream media attention. It appears this legislation has an uphill battle. On the other hand, pushing for tax incentives has broad public appeal and may be the political trick needed for many of the incumbent candidates need for their re-election cycle."

For example, lawmakers may simply increase the unit limits. After all, lawmakers do not want to commit to limitless subsidies. Such measures gain the support of detractors by including provisions that cap their overall costs. Unit limits are one way to do that (another might be to have a sunset clause in the form of: past year X, the credits are phased out gradually). Lawmakers may also sign a brand new law for incentivizing EVs."

The tax credits are on the one hand popular with climate hawk democrats. At the same time, they draw ire from lawmakers who just see them as a way to allow rich people to buy cool cars. That's not a totally inaccurate view of the tax credits as their short term effect is indeed to make expensive cars slightly cheaper for those who can afford to buy a 50k+ car. Their long term effect is in fact to bring EV technology down its learning curve and usher an era of affordable EVs. But lawmakers may ignore long-term considerations in favor of more pressing issues for their constituents."
