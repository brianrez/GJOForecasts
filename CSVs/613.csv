60948,2021-07-19T12:54:12Z,18,[1.0],[-4.0],"With no summit, South Korean president to skip Olympics - East Oregonian https://www.eastoregonian.com/news/nation_world/with-no-summit-south-korean-president-to-skip-olympics/article_77148da5-528b-5891-969b-13f9cbbd7f5e.html Mon, 19 Jul 2021 11:23:08 GMT > Relations between Seoul and Tokyo have been strained since South Korea’s Supreme Court in 2018 ordered some Japanese companies to compensate Korean forced laborers for their ordeals during Japan’s 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula. The rulings led to further tensions over trade when Japan imposed export controls on chemicals vital to South Korea’s semiconductor industry in 2019. > Seoul accused Tokyo of weaponizing trade and threatened to terminate a military intelligence-sharing agreement with Tokyo that was a major symbol of their trilateral security cooperation with Washington. South Korea eventually backed off and continued the deal after being pressured by the Trump administration, which until then seemed content to let its allies escalate their feud in public. > “The Moon administration has not made enough domestic progress in addressing legal and historical challenges to diplomacy. Meanwhile, the Suga government has mismanaged the situation by insufficiently prioritizing Korea to the point of discourtesy,” Easley said. > “Members of the Biden administration are no doubt disappointed while leaders in North Korea and China delight in the disunity of U.S. allies.” > Also on Saturday, South Korea’s Olympic Committee removed banners at the Olympic athletes’ village in Tokyo that referred to a 16th-century Korean naval admiral who fought off an invading Japanese fleet after the International Olympic Committee ruled they were provocative."

Additionally, South Korea and Japan will likely want to focus on engaging with the United States under the new administration rather than moving closer to China. China's persistent human rights abuses and its aggressive foreign policy also decrease the likelihood of a trade agreement (see the debate currently occurring within the EU about the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment). Lastly, Japanese firms are seeking to move away from China indicating that the necessity of a trade agreement may begin to decrease as some countries begin to reduce their reliance on the Chinese economy.

This fact, plus the claims by Xi that he will accelerate the negotiation now that the RCEP has been concluded, and similar claims from Japan and ROK, suggest an increasing probability of conclusion. The window is almost a full year from now. I think China could put some real momentum behind this agreement if they suspect that it can influence US-China trade with the new administration. I'm aiming a little higher than the crowd forecast, for those reasons: 20%."

Neither country is keen to see it gain further power and influence, especially with the sudden increase in China's naval power and assertion over the local sea territories (9-dash line claims, etc). China also fails to provide transparency and honesty in its numbers regardless of topic. Increased pressure from the United States of America and other countries has also forced much of China's manufacturing into neighboring countries, particularly Vietnam. Increased class standing within China now means much of the populace has the resources (and time) to truly demand more rights from the Communist Party. Good YouTube sources include ""China Uncensored"", ""America Uncovered"", and ""ADVChina"" (vloggers -- takes time to get specifics needed)."

There have been at least annual meetings since 2017, two meetings each in 2017 and 2018. The arrival of possibility for immunization through vaccination (politicians, negotiators, staff, meeting location,...) will further facilitate meetings in 2021 from approx. March, which renders it likely there will be two meetings in 2021, one in each half of the year. There is also an option major talks and/or announcements coincide with the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games in 2021 - if necessary. Since the trade talks have a long history, and the final agreement will likely have the shape of a ""RCEP+"" deal, there may not be as many topics open to negotiate. The RCEP deal has already been signed and will deliver a solid foundation of the additional negotiations on selected higher standards. The RCEP signature took place even under pandemic conditions, which underscores the value and the importance to all parties involved."

With the signing of RCEP, India walking away from it, a new US president who may (and should in my opinion) re-join the CPTPP...this is actually a far more complex question than it first appears on the surface. I'm in a trade class taught by the guy who says ""The RCEP will connect about 30 percent of the world's people and output and, in the right political context, will generate significant gains"" (Plummer) and the class has had some interesting conversations revolving around just such a possibility. I personally think a trilateral agreement is more likely than say, the US joining RCEP, but there is still a political dimension to the whole mess. Also, I actually just re-read the question and this is a whole year out...almost too much obscuring mists of time to really see clearly. Crystal ball prediction is 33% chance yes but there are some difficult hurdles to overcome."
