It's not a political job despite the politization, and Breyer doesn't want the Court to become political, to him more important than R's capturing another seat. That there are apparently 2.5 very political people on the court is irrelevant to him (Alito strongly, Thomas polarized, Kavanaugh 'sorta' but appears more pandering and needing stroking than anything else, Barrett an unknown ... on the left Sotomayor)."

The fact is that Breyer has been emphatic that justices should renounce any allegiance to the political leaning of those who nominated them as justices. Moreover, he has stated that only two things matter to him with respect to retiring: his health and the current court. The final fact is that there is tremendous pressure on him to retire from the members of the party that nominated him. To the best of our knowledge (a HUGE caveat) he has no health problem (that’s 20% of my projection— allowing for a condition he hasn’t disclosed). Given the “state of the court” (his second consideration), with him in the senior liberal role, and therefore a pivotal influence, he is likely inclined to remain. But, the biggest issue likely causing conflict is the pressure he’s getting. To be internally consistent with his own words, he needs to remain immune to that pressure. Because he is human, he is probably also uncomfortable with the implication that he should bend to anyone’s will — especially those who want him to defy his own belief in a non-political court. Based on those facts, I think that his retirement would be likely only if: 1) There is a health condition we don’t know about (20%). That doesn’t seem an unreasonable possibility given his age and the life expectancy of highly educated American, white men (~79); or 2) If he can resolve the internal dissonance of seeming to accede to the political pressure of liberals. Given what we know of his principles, that seems unlikely. But given what we know of his legal opinions, not impossible. (15%)."

However, he has been very public about his desire that the judiciary not be seen as ""politicians in robes"" and specifically mentioned that retirements shouldn't be timed for political reasons. So, given he isn't <i>that</i> old and no major health concerns at the moment, I think he stays to try to let the temp cool. Plus, he is unlikely to be replaced by a Justice who votes the same way he does. Thinks at the Court aren't just Left/Right. He is very different from Kagan who is different from both Breyer and Sotomayor, for example. He presumably wants his view represented, not just someone else from ""The Left""."

In Professor Chabot's 2019 analysis titled ""Do Justices Time Their Retirements Politically?"" (https://dc.law.utah.edu/ulr/vol2019/iss3/1/) she concludes... they don't. She says, ""Since 1954, thirteen Justices retired voluntarily, ten retired involuntarily, and two died. Just over half of the twenty-three retirements were not politically timed."" She says that, ""Poor health and a strong personal desire to remain on the Court often dominated political concerns in the timing of recent retirements. As a result, political timing has played only a limited role in Justices’ retirement decisions in the modern era."""
