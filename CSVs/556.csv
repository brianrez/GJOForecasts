Bahrain's recognition of Israel opened the door to Saudi Arabia recognizing Israel in the future, but Bahrain would have never recognized Israel without some approval from Saudi Arabia. However, the Biden Administration has prioritized Iran over other areas of the Middle East. Efforts to support Israel in the region at this time would most likely undermine negotiations with Iran, especially after the most recent espionage incident. A factor that is hard to account for is the generations of tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia. How supportive is Saudi Arabia of the U.S. reentering the nuclear agreement with Iran? If recognition occurred this year it would be without, or at least with limited, involvement of the United States."

98731,2021-03-05T19:20:03Z,1,[30.0],[30.0],"Saudi normalization with Israel is definitely possible, but it remains questionable whether this will actually occur in 2021. There are a couple of variables that need to be considered. Historically, there have definitely been tensions and disputes between Saudi Arabia and Israel, but there have also been friendly relations and joint efforts between the two, indicating the possibility of official diplomatic recognition. Israel and Saudi Arabia, two of the most important allies for the US in the Middle East, share common interests that they have promoted in a discreet manner as well as share common enemies, such as Iraq and Iran. Though Saudi Arabia has been highly critical of Israel, it has never done anything to threaten it, instead opting for a mediator role to promote a peaceful resolution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. In December 2020, Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan stated that Saudi Arabia is open to full normalization with Israel, but it rests on the condition of Palestinian statehood, believing that establishing a Palestinian state will deliver true peace in the region. Its foremost goal is getting Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table and drafting a Palestinian-Israeli peace plan, so I think this is a key factor to consider when debating whether Saudi Arabia will diplomatically recognize Israel in 2021. Now that several Arab states formally recognize Israel, with the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan normalizing relations with Israel in 2020 through US-brokered deals, Saudi Arabia has stated that it will not follow their lead, despite its clandestine ties to the Jewish state. However, this might change as the US throws their support behind Saudi-Israeli relations as well as a two-state solution. Israeli PM Netanyahu and Prince Mohammed bin Salman allegedly met in secret in November 2020, discussing several issues, such as how to coordinate moves if the Biden administration rejoins the Iranian Nuclear Deal, but they reached no substantial agreements. This indicates a willingness to collaborate in furtherance of geopolitical interests. And though Saudi Arabia has maintained that it will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without a resolution to the Palestinian issue, the Saudi government has been pushing to change Saudi public opinion about Jews and to increase outreach to Jewish communities, especially to notable Jewish figures. Taking all of this into consideration, I do not see Saudi Arabia formally establishing diplomatic relations with Israel unless there are some efforts made by Israel to establish Palestinian statehood or to at least negotiate and draft a peace plan with the Palestinians. Saudi Arabia has placed its support behind the Palestinian people for so long that it is highly unlikely that it abandons the Palestinians to establish formal ties with Israel. However, with the new Biden administration restoring relations with the Palestinians, renewing aid to Palestinian refugees, and publicly announcing its support for a two-state solution, we might see some incentives implemented to encourage negotiations between Israel and Palestine. Israel has been historically opposed to a two-state solution (obviously), but as Israel suspended its plans to annex the West Bank in exchange for establishing full diplomatic relations with the UAE, we could see a similar compromise made by Israel in order to establish advantageous relations with Saudi Arabia. This could be impeded depending on the Biden administration’s approach to relations with Saudi Arabia, as it has been reported that Biden has broken with Trump’s approach, stating that the US would hold Saudi Arabia accountable for human rights abuses; however, Israel has warned the US that pressuring Middle Eastern allies on issues related to human rights could jeopardize Israeli relations with the Arab countries and indirectly strengthen Iran. Though it is important to the US that its allies align with its values, I think that the Biden administration might temporarily overlook Saudi Arabia’s human rights abuses (if they do not worsen) in order to continue to promote Middle Eastern stability, keep Iran under check, and encourage positive relations between Israel and Arab countries. If we were to see Saudi Arabia diplomatically recognize Israel in 2021, I predict it will be in a US-brokered deal in which Israel agrees to engage in negotiations with the Palestinians in return for formal recognition by Saudi Arabia. I think it is more likely that this will happen in 2022 after the Biden administration more fully establishes itself and COVID-19 (hopefully) is no longer a primary concern, but it is still possible we will see this happen in 2021, which is why I am giving a 30% chance of occurrence."

Holding back this is the fact that Saudi Arabia is the custodian of Mecca and Medina and will be cautious of Turkey or Iran wanting to wrest this crown from them. The Saudi populace has been the recipient of 70 years of anti-Israel rhetoric and some studies shown that 80% would be against a full normalisation, which indicates a progressive, incremental move towards any rapprochement. Another issue that will pause the process are the internal politics of the Royal House of Saud and the opinions of the older generation, Prince Turki bin Faisal for example and its ambivalence towards Israel and concern over the Palestinian people. The young Crown prince, MBS may wish to proceed but must stay respectful to the elders. Therefore, Saudi Arabia may one day diplomatically recognise Israel, but not yet."
