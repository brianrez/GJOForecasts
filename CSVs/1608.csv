So my estimate is based on another estimate - this just feels wonky! GM needs to sell 2,200 Bolt EV's a month for the next two months to get over 10,000. This looks less and less likely to happen (even though they averaged over 2,600 per month the last half of 2017. The Bolt EV still qualifies for government incentives, including up to $7,500 in Federal income tax credits and (select) state rebates. There have been Increases in gas prices over the last several months while competitor TESLA is unable to meet production goals. and yet the April sales estimate fell by 28% compared to last month. The April 2018 seasonality factor is less than 1 and finance rates on 5-year consumer loans from banks for new cars are up from just over 4% to close to 5% over the last 6 months. This may be contributing to the estimated slowdown in sales. Irrespective of the reasons why and barring another oil embargo, I now feel confident that less than 10,000 Chevrolet Bolt EV's will be sold between January and June 2018."

Again without the benefit of much historical data, this is going to be a tough forecast. The expected bump in sales from Consumer Reports giving the Bolt top marks and Motor Trend bestowing Bolt with the EV of the Year award was smaller than I expected. While the increase in sales from January was a solid 21 percent, given January, February, November, and December look to be the slowest sales months based on their Federal Reserve seasonal factor numbers, I've revised my forecast down. With the benefit of two more data points (Jan & Feb sales data), the expected growth in units demanded based on the 6 month moving average of units sold dropped by over 4 percent - likely reflecting the winter doldrums. This reduced the expected total number sold to about $14,300. Anything can happen between now and June from a massive recall to a large spike in gas prices which is a reason for the ""shotgun approach"" to the probabilities. (Another is the mean absolute % error being so big.) Let's see if my new improved calculations hold up when the actual March sales numberis releasd in Early April. Stay tuned!"

Nonetheless, the Bolt may appeal to many average consumers who are ready to take the plunge. Also, I would consider the not so obvious agents of change such as Uber drivers, delivery drivers who use their own vehicles. When the US wakes up and realizes that the short-haul market is ripe for savings in fuel, things may start to change. One of the principle drivers will be the availability of charging stations. GM could use its influence to promote charging station growth which would float the entire industry. Tesla has taken the lead with its network of Superchargers​."

In a nutshell, I took the monthly sales data and deseasonalized it using 'Federal Reserve Seasonal Factors for Motor Vehicle Sales'. I then took a 5-month moving average of the sales figures and ran some simple formulas to solve for units of demand and deviation from that demand. Applying a growth formula for the remaining 5 months 'til June 2018 (January's sales #'s are already available) and backed out the seasonal factors or ""reseasonalized"" (totally made that up) and totaled the estimates. The probability estimates are normal distribution percentages one and two standard deviations from the mean. I will revisit this each month and revise and refine my forecast along the way."

Also, the last three months of the year seem to usually account for more than third of the yearly sales. Projecting the 9000 sold units from the last three months of 2017 (when the model was available nationwide) upwards, we get an expected amount of a bit above 27000.

On the supply side it seems difficult for more than 25,000 to be sold in 6 months (per @cmeinel) The rest of the forecast is based on me thinking that a value around 18-19k is in line with growth, with decent potential for the various factors (tax-credit, macro economics, large corporate/government purchase agreement) driving it higher or lower. Answers I'd like to know: What is the historic seasonality of auto sales? Do any large states have EV policies (rebates for cars or charging stations) taking place on January 1, 2018?"

Depending on whether you extrapolate from July, Aug, or the two combined, and how you estimate those months share of total sales, the estimates will vary between 10,500 and 13,000. Fleets will be wary, since the charging infrastructure may not be there to start and drivers may not trust it. Probably fleets won't buy much in 2018, so I wouldn't expect that to change the overall sales numbers much.

Am I missing something obvious? US historic sales show rise, but current best month extrapolated to first six months next year result in less than 10k, which seems to make under 10k more likely than I believe most are considering. Looking at competitive sales, 10-15k seems most likely."
