Of course, the stock may not stay at this price level for long, but thought it might be of interest since it indicates that, unless the price starts going higher, the forecast should fall pretty rapidly from today forward. In 10,000 random-walk simulations, the stock crosses the threshold just under 17% of the time based on sampling from a high-volatility period of historical data (i.e. 2022 price fluctuations). At this point its best chance for a positive resolution would probably be a series of ""lucky"" days where the stock jumps a few percentage points and a minimal number of ""unlucky"" days with the stock falling. Random fluctuations pushing the stock in the ""right"" direction could yet push it over the threshold."

Given the larger increments of interest rate hikes (like today on 5/4), the market ticks upwards. So...I suppose I'll circle back on this. Today Meta trades at $223 and while a 6.7% increase in 2 weeks' time seems unlikely, I think it wouldn't be unreasonable to see the price getting closer...and then setting off a buying spree."

I guess it seems like an appropriate time post-earning to take a lay of the land and forecast this question again.I continue to believe that Meta is pretty drastically oversold when compared to it's Mega-cap tech peers. It continues to be a cashflow generating machine that despite some concerns about it's old namesake product; has been diversifying into a bunch of different products and areas of business for years. (See my initial forecast: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1416352 ) However, up until earnings it appeared that Macro factors caused by Monetary tightening by the FED were leading to compression across the Tech sector as a whole; dragging Meta down with it. (I originally thought that aggressive monetary tightening was already priced into the market after the interest rate hikes at the March meeting. Apparently it was not entirely priced in at that point). I was just about ready to capitulate that these Macro factors would lead to the stock remaining below the threshold beyond the deadline date if earnings resulted in a flat to negative result.However, with the large rebound of the stock after reporting earning, the NASDAQ (At least currently) holding key levels around 12600, and several other large Mega-cap tech companies reporting after the bell today; it seems like we could be primed for a continued dramatic reversal if AAPL and/or AMZN put up big number tonight. (Driving up tech at an index level)Right now FB is sitting at ~$205, needing about ~14% in the next month, and is approaching key price levels around ~$210. If FB is able to overcome this $210 in the next week or so it technically appears to have a lot of room to run to the upside. (I am assuming if it can break back above this level in the next week we are likely to see this resolve as a ""Yes"") If the NASDAQ rebounds back off it's 12600 level (AAPL and AMZN earning should be a big factor in this) this seems likely to me. If FB rejects this ~$210 level and/or the NASDAQ breaks down below the ~12600 level in the next week than I think this one almost certainly a ""No"". I do think that the NASDAQ will hold these key levels and rebound, which in turn will drive FB up with it above ~$210 this week. Although, I certainly have been humbled by this question around my certainty of the outcome. I am going to leave a 20% margin of error that the NASDAQ still has another leg down from here."

It's drifted from there but I suspect the price is now more at the will of the wider market. 57 days between now and the resolution. In the last 7 we have seen enough volatility to push the price of the stock up from 186 to 213. I don't think we need to see a general sustained upward trend in stocks to necessarily reach the $238. I'm essentially reversing my postion here to say I think that in 57 days this is really very likely to happen.

FB only has 5 trading days per week (and fewer on weeks with holidays) and therefore has fewer opportunities to close above $238.00 than the original simulation suggested.

Generally, it's a substantial move for the stock to make in a short period of time. If I had the numbers at my disposal I'd try to find out how often FB shares have made a ~15-20% move in a two month time frame. Given the shares have been quite oversold on the back of their last earnings and the general growth->value transition, I wouldn't be surprised to see a ""catch-up"" trade if we do get a risk-on environment. Given the macro (war, rising rates, growth->value rotation, anti-tech sentiment, earnings risk for FB) I do lean to a ""NO"" scenario. That said, given the market volatility and how oversold tech has gotten this year, maybe the first rate hike and expectation of liftoff from the Fed is priced in and we'll see a counter-trend bounce that pushes FB above the $238 price."

The 52-week high is $384, so that target is well within the current trading range. Current price is close to 52-week low (($185). The big drop in early February seemed due to the shifting advertising model and a first-time decline in subscribers. [1] The next earnings report for FB is currently estimated for Apr 27, leaving the market a month to respond before end of the question period. Still, these seem like significant issues for core of business, and resolution may take longer. Still, price target seems well within typical price volatility range."

I'd raise it a bit higher, but I also hadn't considered how long its been since FB put out the lower earnings expectations and how persistent the downward trend in their stock price has been since then, its been about a month and a half since the 26% drop and its kept dropping. Its either a stickier narrative than I thought, or there's additional worries about geopolitical risk the impact of FB/IG being banned in Russia, or there's other narratives that are also gaining steam, like Google or Microsoft as competing ""metaverse plays"". Just a moderate adjustment for now."

99943,2022-03-16T03:05:02Z,1,[47.0],[47.0],"Given that Meta shares were above $238 for most of the past year, this would seem possible. Inflation is likely to push stock prices up in general, too. However, some reasons for the recent fall in Meta's stock price seem likely to persist in the forecast period (e.g., Apple privacy changes). And I don't know how much of their revenue was from Russia, but that'll largely be gone probably for quite a while. A potentially big move in share price could come after the next quarterly earnings report in early May, but other events could also affect the price as well, of course. But a 24% increase from today's price would seem somewhat unlikely in the forecast period, as the forces that brought the stock to its current price will likely persist and dominate its price in the forecast period. Another factor to consider, though, is that this question asks whether the share price will close above $238 on *any* day between March 8 and May 20. Given the volatility of this stock, I think there's a considerable chance that this could happen. Also, it has only been below $238 most recently since the Q4 2021 earnings report was released. If the Q1 2022 earnings report is rosier, share prices could just as easily rise again. https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/03/facebook-shares-plummet-22percent-after-reporting-weak-guidance.html"
