""A lot of people who fled Kunduz last year at this time when the Taliban had taken over the city returned to Kunduz. So the number of people trying to flee again today was huge,"" Sadiqi said.

The overhaul of the Afghan electoral system prior to a new parliamentary election was a key part of the post-election power-sharing deal reached between President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah. Whilst both agree in not holding an election before the process is overhauled, there is disagreement on how to proceed and who should oversee the process. Ghani's recommendation of Shukria Barakzai for the post was rejected by Abdullah, who saw her as being too close to Ghani. Simultaneously Abdullah has also been strongly opposed to the same officials overseeing the election as oversaw the 2014 Presidential election, due in part to the widespread belief that Ghani benefited from the 2014 elections irregularities compared to Abdullah. Tying into this is the fact that no officials from the election have been charged with any crime or removed. In contrast to Abdullah's more hardline calls for total overhaul, Ghani's supporters have been more supportive of more limited reforms."

Seems like a common story around the world when it comes to elections in countries without a strong electoral and historical institution.

The election announcement is viewed as political, due to the Karzai appointment. Nuristani reportedly claimed the gov't was not cooperating on a new election process, yet, needed to provide a budget, ensure security (for polling centers, staff, candidates and voters), and ensure gov't bodies co-operate. First time district council elections in a large number of constituencies, many insecure, with unclear boundaries and varying district lists are also issues."

The election date was announced by the Independent Election Commission, whose legitimacy has been consistently challenged by Abdullah's supporters. One of the biggest problems in the last Presidential election was that about 20 million voter ID cards had been issued to an electorate of 12 million, hence allegations of fraud (on both sides) were hardly a surprise. Though I haven't yet found any reports after those in January when the 15 October date was announced, I very much doubt that elections will be held as scheduled. The absence of news is probably telling, as otherwise we should be hearing about preparations. In addition, the Taliban have announced a spring offensive."
