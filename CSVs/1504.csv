The view seems to be that Boris's leadership bid will not now be until the Conference. The EU that dislikes Boris even more strongly than the UK general public does and most of his fellow Conservative MPs do, has been sowing confusion very successfully in the UK media who seem to have confused Barnier's remarks about the UK EU Withdrawal Agreement (aka The Brexit Agreement) being about the UK EU Future Trade Deal. Barniers has not suggested that the EU is likely to agree to the Chequers Proposal in the next 6 to 8 weeks if both sides are realistic, he was referring to the Withdrawal Agreement which according to the EU timetable was to have been agreed in October (2017 not 2018) and was agreed in principal on 8th Dec 2017. So if the Withdrawal Agreement has taken at least 3 times longer than planned, we should expect to see a trade deal agreement some time around autumn 2021. (Just as well it will be ""the easiest Trade Deal in History"" otherwise we might have a long wait!)"

Don't see this playing well with Britons. According to YouGov’s polling, 11 percent of Britons believe Trump is a great or good president. But 67 percent, a vast majority, believe he is a poor or terrible president."

I am not sure if he does not support the Mrs Mays's Customs idea because (like the EU and almost everyone else) he does not think it workable, or because he is now a hard Brexit supporter. In one sense it Mrs May's Customs options are irrelevant, because they have already been rejected as impractical (magic thinking) by the EU. While Mrs May insists that the border with Ireland will remain as it is, and that the UK will be doing free trade with 3rd countries once outside the EU, it appears to be impossible to see any way to achieve her objectives. There is now a three way split in the Conservative Party and any one of these groups could force Mrs May out. The Hard Brexit group insists on nothing that looks like a Customs Union (and Single Market) with the EU. It has no solution to the Irish Border (except possible scrap the Good Friday agreement which created the open border). The Soft Brexit group see the solution as staying in Customs Union and Single Market with the consequence of not having 3rd party free trade deals (but they could do deal to give services access to 3rd countries). The Rump group want some leadership and a practical solution found to Brexit. As the Brexit negotiations fail to produce any progress the Rump might decide a new leader is needed. I detect a hint that the Hard Brexit group are preparing their excuses for the failure of Brexit. Failure in their eyes would be to deliver a Brexit that did not have 3rd country trade deals, but if the choice is between the free trade deals (aka ""getting a packet of crisps one day"") and scrapping the open border and screwing up trade with Europe (aka ""a three course dinner today"") the Rump would prefer the ""three course meal"". The Hard Brexiteers are threatening to vote against a final Brexit Deal that does not given them what they promised (but that is impossible to deliver). This would allow them to claim that Parliament had betrayed Brexit and that if Mrs May had only done what they demanded the (impossible) Brexit they said people voted for would have happened. In other words they are trying to save their credibility for after Brexit when it fails to deliver. Getting rid of Mrs May would not help them, if one of the Hard Brexiteers were PM there still would be no way they could deliver Brexit as outlined by them. One of the many ironies of Brexit is that the Hard Brexiteers sold Brexit as ""bringing back power to Parliament"", to avoid giving Parliament any of power over a EU deal they claim that the referendum was very clear and all voters understood very clearly the issues such as the Irish Border, Customs Union, Single Market, 3rd Country Trade policies etc and as it was all so clear that Parliament does not need to say if the final deal is any good or not. If everyone knew exactly what they were voting for in June 2016, how is it that 23 months later the Cabinet can't agree what deal the UK wants with the EU? If it was so clear to the voters then, why is not known by the Cabinet today?"

She appeared to be Trump's poodle over attacking Syria, when 2/3rds of the public was against it. She did not consult Parliament when most MPs wanted her to. She appears to be the primary person responsible for the policies that resulted in the fiasco of trying to deport the Windrush Kids, she put off accepting their was a problem, she put off seeing the Commonwealth ministers who had asked to discuss it with her. She was the Home Secretary when the records were destroyed (but claims that a Labour Home Secretary had ordered the destruction a year previously). Brexit policy seems to be to put off having a policy and hope something turns up. Any of these issues would have raised demands for her resignations from her own party in normal times, but these are not normal times. Labour seems to have a leader that is even further out of touch with his MPs than May is with hers. It is just possible that MPs are waiting until May and Corbyn have between them proved that Populists are not good for a country and the public demand better government. A new report and poll showing (using government data) the cost of Brexit and the seeming surprise it was to voters, who (in the poll) seem to have decided that don't like the cost of what Mrs May is trying to get them, indicates lots of Brexit problems ahead (best for her not to get close to any deal, because the closer she get to a deal the more people will ask what the cost will be)."

So even assuming the 25% or so of the text that is not yet agreed, can be agreed in the next few days, there is no certainty that it will ever have legal standing. In this case the ""fall back position"" regarding the Irish border is pretty meaningless. If, as happened with the Dec 2017 outline agreement on the Withdrawal, and Brexiteers cannot get an agreement to have an open border and at the same time have Northern Ireland outside the Single Market and Customs Union, then there seems nothing to stop the UK refusing to ratify the EU Withdrawal agreement at any future date and introduce a hard border. This is surely not what the EU intends, so I would assume that the EU would insist on some legal certainty that the Withdrawal Agreement stands. Unless this happens Mrs May would appear to be safe as PM until after 1 Oct because a ""magic"" solution to the Irish border and Unique Trade Deal will be theoretically be possible until proved impossible, which will not be until after 1st Oct. If the agreement has no legal standing then the ""implementation"" period is not certain either, so businesses are unlikely to be happy."

Rees Mogg for example now says he will accept the ECJ as long as the UK can (in theory) choose to ignore it. This is the legal situation of all countries outside the EU, including those like Norway who are in the EEA. They follow Single Market rules, use EU institutions, take note of the EFTA Court that follows ECJ rulings, but legally these countries can choose to ignore the EFTA Court (but of course if they do, they loose their trade deals with the EU). The fact that Rees Mogg is willing to go along with this seems to indicate that the Brexiteers know they cannot get the Hard Brexit they want thru parliament. If they can't get Hard Brexit thru parliament there is little point trying to kick May out. But another risk has emerged from MPs not happy about May's general non-Brexit performance. Its a cumulative problem of tough talk about action to deal with problems that results in nothing or next to nothing being done. e.g. action of plastic waste (bottles, coffee cups etc.) where action is promised that then doesn't; cheap rail travel that turns out to be rationed). The next test for Mrs May is what if anything she will do about (alleged) Russian terrorism in the UK and donations to political parties by Russians. May is now reaching the point were everything she does (or does not) is annoying lots of people, including Conservative MPs."

I think if we actually get to the polls, Corbyn will win. I will feel much more confident making a prediction on all this after the May elections."

Having agreed a deal on Phase 1 of Leaving the EU it has become clear that Mrs May is not able to get the Brexiteers to accept it. The Implementation period asked for (by the UK) was agreed in principle as a period in which the UK would be outside the political institutions of the EU but that would otherwise maintain the status quo. Since then the Brexiteers have been insisting that during the implementation period the status quo would not apply to the way that new EU migrants would be dealt with, that the UK would expect to make (not just negotiate) trade deals with 3rd countries, not be subject to all EU rules and laws, and even that the UK might want to not have an implementation period. Since last week's Brexit Committee meeting the UK government has been unable to agree to provide any clarification as to what it wants. As it seems the Brexit Committee was deadlocked, but Mrs May felt unable to either present her view of the way forward (it is reported she did not offer any views at all) or to use to her position to break the deadlock it must be concluded that she is so weak that whatever view she expressed or supported would not have been supported by the Parliamentary Conservative Party (PCP). At some point the UK government must take decisions on Brexit. Mrs May seems to be hoping that some external event will miraculously unite the PCP to one view which she can then follow. So the question is will such an external event change things before the PCP gets tired of waiting of waiting for a miracle to happen? Or even if the miracle does happen will the PCP decide that Mrs May is no the person to implement whatever type of Brexit the miracle suggests can/needs to be delivered. Possible ""events"" are a Conservative rebellion by Soft or Hard Brexit MPs or by Conservative Peers, or the EU shuts down negotiations until the UK gets it act together, a very clear vote in the local elections due in May, or unions and employers demand action, Conservative donors publicly announce no more funding. The excuse that the PCP cannot agree on who would be better than Mrs May, is becoming rather thin as it looks like anyone would probably be better than nothing, and in reality having Mrs May as PM is not much different from having no one as PM. Mrs May seems to be running out of road down which to kick the can."

Presumably the objective was to show that the Conservative Party is the environmental party and by being the environmental party to appeal to green voters who Mrs May assumes are the younger voters, which the Conservatives lack. But the ""policy"" failed to impress. Older voters have pointed out (see BBC link) that in 2005 the Conservatives claimed to have seen the (green) light, but when they had the power to do something about it they seem to had second thoughts. Others have pointed out most of the environmental improvements carried out in the last 30 years have been due to EU legislation e.g. forcing the UK to stop pumping raw sewage into the sea and rivers, clean up beaches, ban chemicals, improve air quality, reduce the numbers of single use plastic bags, install wind farms and solar panels. As Mrs May is not known to have had any interest in the environment, apart from re-introducing fox hunting, the green leaning younger voters are not likely to be impressed. The comment ""Talk is Cheap"" seems to apply to much of Mrs May's supposed aspirations, that do not seem to actually match any actions. The cynics (and realists) regard a 25 year plan to reduce plastic packaging as just talk."

All the media regardless of political views are agreeing that her cabinet reshuffle was badly done, from announcements made that were then withdrawn to ministers refusing to accept jobs. It had also been widely reported that elements that the media thought were good seem to be in spite of Mrs May, not because of her planning them. Pro and anti Brexit media is concerned that if she cannot organise the membership of her cabinet then negotiating a complex deal with the EU (and all member states) is a worry. The question is how bad May's performance has to get before the 1922 Committee decides that she has to go, in spite of their not being any other Conservative MP who looks likely to be able to rescue the government. The 1922 Committee will obviously be aware that another general election would probably make things worse for the Conservatives so they will want to avoid that at all costs. So if Mrs May goes it will not be due to another general election this year, but because the Conservative Party replaces her as leader. If that were to happen a new PM would have to complete the Brexit negotiations, which would require compromises to be made (May's ""red lines"" will not survive in negotiations) and so whatever Brexit was agreed (or not agreed) would not match any version that the electorate had voted on, which would surely increase demands for another General Election. Another General Election would be likely to reject who ever the May replacement was. The 1922 Committee will know this; the EU will know this, and both will act accordingly e.g. the EU will not offer a version of Brexit can the UK PM can present to the UK voters as a triumph because they will see a bad Brexit offer as forcing the UK to hold an election (to accept or Reject it). The 1922 Committee will see changing the PM has the first move in a process which is likely to lead to kicking the Conservatives out of power. So my conclusion is; bad as she is her many detractors in the Conservative Party will have to keep her as PM because if she goes its likely that the Conservative Party looses power."

Rumours of a cabinet re-shuffle giving Boris Johnson responsibility for implementing the Brexit deal - a poisoned chalice - suggest deep animosity between Johnson and May. It is possible that Johnson's unbridled personal ambition could force a leadership election, and that such a contest could see the DUP withdraw support, leading to an election and a labour PM.

She could loose the support of the DUP and no longer command a majority in Parliament or she could be overthrown by hard line Brixiteers or hard line Remainers in the Conservative parliamentary party (15% to 25% chance). But a walkout by the DUP would not result in any conceivable majority government that would be more likely to support DUP views, so it is difficult to see any advantage to them in walking out. Replacing Mrs May with any Conservative that actually had any strong views of Brexit would cause more obvious fractures in the Conservative parliamentary party - a strong hard Brexit PM would not be supported by enough MPs to push a hard Brexit through parliament, a strong soft Brexit or no Brexit PM would not be supported by all Conservative MPs, but with support from most of the other parties in parliament they could command a majority for a soft Brexit or no Brexit. If DUP or Conservative rebels (of the hard or soft variety) meant May did not have a majority it would be bound to lead to calls for a general election, and the last general election did not go well for the Conservative Party or for the Hard Brexit cause so Conservatives will want to avoid another one."

May was the longest surviving Home Secretary in 60 year (Good survival instincts). She is considered to be more in tune with the British people than Cameron (less elitist) .

As far as I can see, the only chance the Tory government collapses is once the Brexit deal gets put to Parliament and that is unlikely to be before October 2018. After the disaster this year, no chance they May is clearly weak, reports last week suggest that there ~40 Tory MPs willing to signal no confidence and trigger a party leadership election. I'm not sure who would want to take the job right now though, taking over now means putting your name to the Brexit negotiations which look to be a bit of a mess. As the negotiations draw to a close in the second half of the year I see the chance of a leadership challenge increasing. With that in mind I'd say it was slightly more likely than not."
