Will Verizon and Yahoo conclude their merger before 1 June 2017?,2017-01-17T18:00:56Z,2017-05-31T17:00:48Z,No,"['Yes, for a price of less than $4.8258 billion', 'Yes, for a price of $4.8258 billion', 'Yes, for a price more than $4.8258 billion', 'No']",['Business'],679,654,238,237,"In July 2016, Verizon Communications Inc. agreed to purchase and merge with Yahoo Inc. in a $4.8258 billion deal. The merger was supposed to be completed by March 2017, but has been delayed by the revelation of widespread hacking of 1 billion of Yahoo's users (Fortune, CBS, US News). Should a final merger deal involve Verizon offering equity as well as cash, the dollar value of the equity provided plus the cash provided will be used to calculate the final price of the deal (e.g. NY Times).

The 15% chance the deal happens before June 1 is due to how much Verizon may actually need Yahoo despite the issue with user data breeches. If Verizon is at risk of not maintaining the impressive dividend growth and the Yahoo acquisition prevents this stagnation a deal may be reached before June 1 but certainly for less than $4.8258 billion as a $350 million dollar discount has already been agreed to."

Fourth quarter earnings have drove Verizon to negotiate a $350 million drop in price. In addition, no timeline for the acquisition has been proposed. As it stands now, the price is likely to be negotiated somewhere between 4.8258 billion and 4.475 billion. This suggests that a feasible negotiating price would be near 4.5627 billion after meeting in the middle two times. This price is not more than 4.8258 billion nor is it even near that number. For that reason I would conclude a 0% chance of a higher price or equal price. The data breaches and fourth quarter earnings bring up a no-deal scenario, which is possible. However, with the AT&T/Direct TV merger for $67 billion, it seems there is very aggressive acquisition behavior in the telecommunications industry. I conclude 20% no deal, 80% less than 4.8258 billion."

They might be foreseeing risks of commoditization of the core business and the rationale for the merger is preemptive to preserve competitive positioning. Competitor AT&T has acquired Direct TV and Comcast acquired NBC/Universal adding to the motivation to get the deal done. AOL, whom Verizon now owns, attempted while it was an independent company to merge with Yahoo in 2013. Now Verizon, still seeing the logic of that deal, has the opportunity to make it happen at a better price. No court in Delaware, where Yahoo is incorporated, has ever found that a material adverse effect has occurred that would allow companies to terminate a merger agreement and although there may be more damage that is latent and yet to become visible, the breach, albeit only recently reported, took place in 2014 which has allowed time for major damage to cash flows resulting from the data breach to materialize in Yahoo's financials. Lastly, there will be a renegotiation and although a price concession is the easiest form of renegotiation, due to the nature of the problem, a price concession seems less likely than a delay and/or clawback/indemnification provision. Nevertheless, regarding the price concession there is reputation to consider and given Verizon's strong position in the negotiation they will likely require some win on price to preserve reputation and this is why I believe that the deal will close but at a lower than sticker price."
