The presidential election is scheduled for 20 May 2020 and the time around the election could be violent. The incumbent president has said that he will not run again in 2020, but he already has had an unconstitutional third term and appears to want to remain in power and so I cannot see him not running again. Such a scenario is likely to lead to protests and government crackdowns. Whether the fatalities threshold will be met by the end of June is another story. I do not see the country descending into civil war again, at least not by 30 June 2020."
