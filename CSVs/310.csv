Deaths would need to average <3.1k/day to stay in bin 2, 3.1-7.1k/day to stay in bin 3, 7.1k-11.1k/day to stay in bin 4, 11.1k-15.2k/day to stay in bin 5, and >15.2k/day to reach bin 6. There has been a downward trend in deaths/day since January, 2021. I think it's likely that there will be additional wave or 2 of some size (including at least the current BA.2 wave) in world cases and deaths between now and the end of the question; I expect cases to oscillate with noise around the downward trend. The trend has been a decline of very approximately 1.0-1.1k/day per 3 months; if we say that the trend is currently at ~5.5-6.0k/day, if we extrapolate this trend, we could expect it to be at very roughly 4.0-4.5k/day at the end of the forecast period. This trend would place deaths firmly in bin 3. It's very hard for me to picture deaths staying in bin 2, but it's possible, especially if by some miracle there's a pause in the emergence of new variants that sweep the world. And even if there were another wave of deaths as large as the Omicron wave, that would add another ~0.65M deaths, and deaths would remain under 7.0M. For deaths to exceed 7.0M, there would need to be one or more even larger waves. There are 4 months left in the forecast period, so it could be possible. More than 7.5M doesn't seem likely to me at this time; it would require a new variant to emerge that is drastically antigenically different from previous variants and that causes large waves. That's not by any means impossible, of course, but it wouldn't fit the pattern of what we have seen so far. So, with a lot of uncertainty, bin 3 looks most likely to me at the moment."

From then on if decline continues I can foresee 6.48M as an optimistic total. More likely considering the length of the term remaining is that some other variant appears and/or one or more continents suffer another surge in cases, such as currently seen in Hong Kong. The possibilities due to reducing immunity, seasonal effects and vaccine distribution and season effects still suggest the total will be heading towards 7.0M."

However I don’t think rates will reduce back below 10k for a bit, which makes getting 7.5m much more likely. Current levels indicate it could be quite close around 7.5m, but edging higher for now. US and EU make up 1/3rd of death numbers as they have the highest rate of reporting so affect the numbers a lot. Unless their rates reduce (not much sign of that at the moment, running fairly steady for a while around 4k per day between them) the total is unlikely to drop a lot, and increases from any other part of the world only add to this base level."

It appears the SA wave of cases was not very high because the school session ended and tons of migrant workers went home. Everywhere else, the Omicron wave has been gigantic. And the wave of deaths in the US is approaching the level seen with Delta. The outcome in terms of deaths has been far better in the UK, thanks to vaccinations, but the rest of the world will likely not fare nearly as well. Omicron is just starting to hit India, for instance. India could well see another wave of hospitalizations and deaths on the scale of that seen next year, and Omicron is substantially more contagious. That could add another 200k-300k deaths. Other countries in Asia and in S America will likely see substantial Omicron deaths as well. So, if deaths continue their downward trend, I'd expect ~6.7M. But I'm starting to think reported deaths could well end up >7.0M or even >7.5M."

A couple cases of community transmission were found in Tianjin, a megacity of 13M less than 100 miles from Beijing. Something like 18 cases among contacts of those cases have been found. Regions of Tianjin are going into lockdown, and the whole city is getting PCR tests. Tianjin University is closed. Will China be able to stop Omicron? It's only a bit more contagious than Delta, but I have to wonder whether there's a limit to how contagious a virus can be stopped. If any country can stop it, China can, though. But if not, it could cause a lot of deaths in China. Somewhere >50% of the country is vaccinated with a vaccine that is likely not very effective against Omicron. The rest of the population has no immunity to Covid. Omicron is probably inherently more virulent (causes more severe disease) than the ancestral (original Wuhan) variant, so the situation could get quite bad if it were to get out of control."

I don't believe disturbances in the death rate are distributed normally; I believe that increases at this point are not as likely as decreases, though there is still a possibility that there's a long tail of a mutation that kills a ton of people.

There will be some spread and some reported deaths in Asia. Few deaths will be reported in Africa, Oceania and China, for very different reasons.

So 5.20M + 2.68M = 7.88M. ~0.4M from the Delta wave in India and surrounding countries in the spring; one would hope that that wouldn't be repeated. Omicron (and/or other variants) would likely be allowed to spread largely unrestrained in the US, parts of S America (e.g., Brazil), and parts of Europe, but seasonality would likely kick in to dampen spread in the N Hemisphere starting in January. Otoh, we don't know yet how transmissible or virulent Omicron and/or other variants are. If it is more transmissible and/or virulent than the ancestral variant, which is what was spreading last winter, then we could see more deaths this winter in the N Hemisphere. If it is less transmissible and/or virulent, then we could see fewer deaths. If its transmissibility and virulence are comparable to those of Delta, then we'll likely be in for trouble, especially with political landscapes as they are. Imagine Delta starting to spread right now with little to no immunity in the entire world, many places with little to no mitigations in place, and no vaccine available until starting in mid-March. That's what we could potentially be looking at."

With vaccination levels slowly improving, decreasing CFR and all other things equal, about 64% of deaths from the equivalent period a year earlier also looks realistic: 2.81M x 0.64= 1.8M (+5.1M= 6.9M total). But socio-politically the tolerance for high case numbers and deaths is now diminishing across Europe, leading to increasing pressure to vaccinate or further lockdowns. I think this will continue elsewhere as we move into another year of Covid, helping to limit deaths further. However there will still be lower-vaccinated territories well behind the curve which could tip things the other way, especially if a new variant or virulent sub-lineage of Delta appears. So I think the result will be a generally lower trend worldwide, particularly through Q2 next year, but with some risk. For now I’m expecting 6.35–6.95M."

So 5.18M + 2.83M = 8.01M would seem to be a good upper limit. I'm starting to be concerned, though, that the way I've been thinking about this (N Hemisphere) winter vs. last winter may be wrong, just because Delta is so much more contagious. Last winter's peak, from Nov 13 through Mar 13, resulted in 1.38M confirmed deaths; this winter will undoubtedly be substantially lower, but how much lower remains to be seen. If it is about the size of the recent Delta wave, from July 7, 2021 to Oct 15, 2021, that would add 0.88M deaths. It will probably be smaller and peak in early Jan as before. Let's say 0.75M for the world by the end of Feb. Then approx 22 weeks at an average of 0.03M/week as vaccination rates grow; 0.03M * 22 = 0.66M. 5.18M + 0.75M + 0.66M = 6.59M. Ranges: 0.60M to 1.3M by the end of Feb, 0.44M to 1.45M thereafter, with higher numbers if new variants that escape existing immunity and/or are more contagious emerge. So: min 5.18M + 0.60M + 0.44M = 6.22M; max = 5.18M + 1.3M + 1.45M = 7.93M, up to but not quite including a wild, new immune escape variant as bad as Delta was vs. Alpha. Forecast: approx 6.59M, min 6.22M, max 7.93M, with the upper part of the range very unlikely unless a very bad new variant emerges."
