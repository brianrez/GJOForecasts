Also because the availability was just slightly effected (http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/cb1993en) It could only have a bigger effect on the affordability because of the economic downturn. But the UAE seems to be less severe effected by the economic consequences than the countries close to it on the FSI.

The major issue is that due to its harsh climate and lack of water resources the UAE must import 85-90% of its food requirements. Global climate changes can only exacerbate these issues. As stated, the Gulf countries are dependent on the openness of the world markets and any problems in the producing countries will result in problems for the end user i.e. the UAE. Therefore, to some degree food security is beyond control of the authorities in the UAE. They have the financial resources to acquire the required produce, but a bad harvest, politics or Force Majeure may pause or prevent delivery. Covid-19 would have an adverse effect of food delivery, given the pandemic may affect the production of food in the producing countries. The UAEâ€™s position on the Global Food Security Index can only rise to a certain point given the lack of control."

I'm only worried about Kuwait - while they ranked further behind at 27th with a score of 74.8, they gained +3.2 points from 2018. With another improvement like that they would overtake the UAE, which scored 76.5. I looked at the 2018 report to try to get a better historical picture but the numbers didn't add up - maybe I'm reading it incorrectly. I think the UAE's focus on food security will let them prevail but I'm not as certain as the crowd."

They've seen a decline in food distribution in some areas, but stability and increases in others. They've also relaxed strict food labeling policies, but they're touting food safety. Moreover, last year, Japan's food sufficiency rate reached an all-time low. Comparatively, United Arab Emirates (UAE) are actively implementing measures to ensure food sufficiency. The Abu Dhabi Agriculture and Food Safety Authority (ADAFSA) also just released new food safety guidelines. Finally, the Emirates Food Security Council seems determined to move UAE to the top 10 in the Global Food Security Index rankings by 2021 and to number 1 position by 2051. The UAE appear to be working on improving food security in their country, while Japan seems content and not as determined to improve food security. So, as long as they stay dedicated to ensuring food sufficiency and security, the UAE should have a fairly easy time overtaking Japan (and liking others) in the rankings."
