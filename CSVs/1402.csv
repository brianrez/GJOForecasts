With on going water shortages cropping up and continued abrasive behavior between Egypt and Ethiopia, I don't see either of them sitting at the table anytime soon to negotiate, just further delays. Much like we have been warned about Climate Change being a global security risk, this is likely to turn out to be another example of that. Without proper negotiations it could result in a conflict."

I want to remain optimistic and say that due to increasingly advanced technology, all three sides on this issue can find a way to compromise and have their biggest concerns answered. The leaders have already agreed to multiple actions in meeting their one month deadline, such as annul state leadership meetings between the three countries and setting up a fund to link the three countries via railway. I overall remain quite optimistic of the developments on this issue."

Rather than the meeting between the three nations to discuss technical issues related to the dam, Egypt and Sudan conducted a bilateral meet between their foreign ministers and high level intelligence officials to speak about international and regional issues of mutual concern. The dam belongs to Ethiopia and they were excluded from the meeting. Egypt and Sudan will have their major water source, the Nile river, compromised when the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is completed. No opening day for the dam has been announced and it is estimated to be about 60% complete. Egypt and Sudan will likely do whatever they can to make sure the dam never opens or the completion is slowed as much as possible. Treaties and promises are well meaning in that area of the world, but water is in short supply for all three countries.
