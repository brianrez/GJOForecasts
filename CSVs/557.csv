(How many times this happened last year? or on the average over the last decade?)” This question made me do some research, but unfortunately I still don't know the exact answer. First of all, I think there is reason to expect that those numbers will not have been made public, as independent investigations have shown that several 100 people died in police custody in 2015 without it being official (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/13/200-people-died-in-russian-police-custody-in-2015-says-website). Linking to this, it is clear that we don't know the full picture, however according to the data that I was able to find about fatalities connected to demonstrations there actually appeared to be none. I found some articles from different demonstrations over the last decade, and none of them seem to have reported fatalities in spite of 1000s of arrests and many injured. 2011-2013 protests - https://web.archive.org/web/20131224121337/https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/07/russia-update-1-tv-pix-idUSL5E7N73K320111207 and https://www.rferl.org/a/russia_rallies_arrests_opposition_protests/24413923.html 2017-2018 protests - https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/05/russian-police-arrest-more-than-200-anti-putin-protesters-siberia"

Authoritarian states in my experience are skilled in avoiding situations that escalate inadvertently to extreme violence resulting in protestor deaths. I observed a bread riot in Havana in the 1990s and marveled at the ruthless, impersonal yet controlled ferocity of the public order police, who had been trained by Soviet advisors. Their training and planning allowed them to inflict terrible beatings while not killing anyone as they systematically locked down the block where the riot was happening. I would assume that same institutional knowledge remains a part of the Russian anti-riot police protocols for today’s protests. The comment by @yagudin about arresting key leaders before protests and warning potential protest leaders to stay home also rang true in my experience. That Navalny and his inner circle are calling for non-violence further reinforces my estimate of a low probability."

Current protests seem to be of a similar scale to previous protests, but with much greater violence and the number of injuries and arrests per protestor (almost an order of magnitude higher). This seems to imply a higher likelihood of deaths during protests. Similar protests over the summer in the United States and during the certification of the election results in 2020 and 2021 led to approximately 30 deaths for reference. The current set of protests is also focused at the government's failure to allow parties unaligned with Putin to stand in elections, as opposed to requests for better social conditions as in 2018. Thus, the higher propensity for violence coupled with the more existential nature of the threat to the Putin Regime and the United Russia party implies a much greater likelihood for casualties and deaths."

The older the demographic, the more likely the support for the incumbent and popular support is still strong.

The older generation remember previous days and hardships and are appreciative of better living conditions today. The police have been aggressive in their reaction to the demonstrations with graphic beatings and jailing of people but there have been no reported deaths connected with this. This question is fraught with potentially wrong assumptions. How would the deaths be reported and confirmed? Does cardiac arrest or death by trauma count? Did any of the demonstrators have the Covid-19 virus? My suggested answer is that there will be no fatalities attributed to anti-government protests."

If fatalities mean any death of anyone connected to the protests, which cannot clearly be explained by health or age, then I think we have reason to suspect at least five casulties. To identify these deaths as well as their cause data independent of Russia would need to be used though. First of all there is reason to expect that the Russian state would try to poison prominent voices within the anti-governement movement, as there is already reason to believe that they tried with Navalny ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/23/here-are-ten-critics-of-vladimir-putin-who-died-violently-or-in-suspicious-ways/ ).
