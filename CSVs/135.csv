Fed intervention in raising rates may be too late, too much. Consumer debt is already reaching record highs. Employment numbers are good, as revealed April report, but looks like most investors are weary about second quarter numbers. I'd expect no only for hiring to slow down but also lay offs. If that happens, it's possible that interest hikes will slow down as well."
