Spain has sought to have him extradited three times over the past two years to no avail. It seems many assessments on whether Puigdemont would return was based on the arrest warrant. However, the big update to Puigdemont was him being accredited as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) on 20 Dec '19 after the European Court of Justice ruled that he was allowed to take his role as MEP. Puigdemont has publicly stated that he would consider going back to Spain if he is assured that he is immune from arrest due to his status as an MEP. According to AP News (https://apnews.com/a2b5e8b21987146c97addd5f3b4d8889), Puigdemont is expecting a ruling from the European Parliament “within weeks” on whether he can visit Spain without being arrested. Given the 18 Apr '20 deadline for this question, it is still unlikely that Puigdemont will return to Spain by Apr, but in my opinion, the possibility is increased from the 2% crowd forecast based on recent updates in the past couple of weeks."

He is quite confortable in Belgium, as he himself said to the press. Some days ago he even visited willingly the belgian judicial authority on the case, and he was set free of charges. Spain has demanded his extradition in two previous ocassions (to Belgium in 2017, to Germany in 2018) and both times the demands were rejected. Also, Belgium has refused extradition to spain historically, even in cases of ETA terrorist members. And even in the case being that Belgium is willing to hand him over to spanish authorities, he would try to escape (we are talking about a man who fled his own country hidden in a car trunk in order to cross the spanish-french border without being arrested, i think that detail is pretty enlightning). 3-.
