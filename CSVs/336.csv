On the other hand, some signals are worth mentioning--North Korea's behaviors, China, Iran, and other threats to US interests. In my recent engagement with the Dehli Policy Group (Indian think-tank) and the below links confirming the same, India specifically is worried the US will lose focus on progress made in the Indo-Pacific. The Quad specifically is a fragile organization as the world watches whether or not it will actually produce action or fall into a mere ""all talk"" organization like is smaller brother ASEAN. This has been a long narrative to say, I am bumping the probability a couple of percentages higher that China will misbehave on the border with India. There is a higher probability China could use the US distraction with Ukraine to poke India."

Perhaps because due to a disputed border with an ever increasing aggressive and more powerful country flexing its muscles. Reports suggest that 50,000 and associated weaponry has been collected around the LAC and the current talks have failed where the Chinese have accused the Indian side of unreasonable and unrealistic demands whereas the Indians accused the Chinese of not providing any forward-looking proposals. Troops are in close proximity in a 3500 km long border. The Chinese will not move back from their position in April 2020 per the Indian demands with giving the Indians, in their view having no option to manning the hostile border with a continuous situation. India is the only country with a disputed land border with China which makes diplomatic efforts complicated and possibly India left to its own devices, internationally. China and India have continued to build up military infrastructure along the border with observation towers and forward troop bases. The result being a congested area competing for strategic territorial advantage that increases the potential of military escalation. Given the growth of Chinese economic and by extension military power (possibly wanting to divert from the Taiwan issues with the US) and the Indians weakened by the economic debilitating effect of Covid, this potential flashpoint is a perennial (or at least semi-annual).
