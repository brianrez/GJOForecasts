There will be a Division Champion, so another outcome is not an option. Both the Bengals and the Ravens are mathematically eliminated from winning the division so they are also forecasted at 0. The Steelers remain the frontrunner by a game. If the Steelers win one of their last two games, they win the Division. It could come as early as this weekend when the Steelers host the Colts, a game they are actually an underdog in at home. The Browns travel to play the hapless New York Jets, a game they are favored in by 9.5. If the Steelers lose and the Browns win, they are tied on record and head into a winner-take-all showdown in Week 17 in Cleveland for the Division title. A win or a tie by the Steelers there would give them the Division; only a win by the Browns (pending the Week 16 outcomes) would give the Browns a division title. The Steelers have lost their last three games, two to opponents under .500. They are in a terrible run of form, the offense has been anemic, and their defense has been plagued by injuries. However, they have one of the top coaches in the NFL in Mike Tomlin, so if there is a presence that can get them refocused to win one of the last two games, it would be him. The Browns are playing some exciting football and have won 5 of their last 6 games (with their lone loss coming at a last second FG to the Ravens). They are in fantastic form and are hungry for their first playoff birth in years. At this point, I cannot see the Steelers beating the Colts. The Browns should take care of the New York Jets, setting up a week 17 showdown. At this point, the Browns would have to be the favorite. However, the Steelers hold ""more outs"" than the singular path that the Browns have so I have to give the Steelers a higher forecast at this point than the Browns. If it does turn into a Week 17 matchup for the AFC North, the tide will turn significantly in the favor of the Browns."

Similarly, while the Steelers haven't lost, they have 4 wins against teams with a total of 3 wins to this point.
