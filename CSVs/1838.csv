Polls have been off by quite a bit in the past mostly due to the difficulty in polling and predicting turnout for the large hispanic population there. I wouldn't be surprised to see the Democrats (both Clinton and Cortez Masto) outperform again this year. That said, it's also a bad idea to completely ignore the polls there, and they've been pretty consistent for Heck, so I'll give him the edge at this point."
