100608,2021-06-19T20:49:50Z,1,[45.0],[45.0],There's a similar price of oil question launching this weekend - this one has only a month to run. Should be easier to forecast I guess! Demand will be driven by Covid recovery. Supply by the OPEC increasing production during July. For now I'm forcasting that price will go down overall (it's down a dollar in 2 days) but it wil be so volatile. Last year the answer would been YES

14027,2021-06-19T20:16:05Z,1,[53.0],[53.0],"If you want to be in the winner circle at the end of this question you have to go all in now, at either 0% or 100%. If you want to minimize your overall brier score you have to be more circumspect. Having been humbled a couple of times after going all in, I'll stay closer to the crowd. Referring to the Bloomberg source that will decide the answer, and looking over a one-year period, the oil price has increased almost without interruption since October 30, 2020. Having increased in 6 of the past 7 months I'll bet that it will do so one more time, but with a probability of only 53%."

In the coming months, we expect that global oil production will increase to match rising levels of global oil consumption. "" ""We expect rising production will end the persistent global oil inventory draws that have occurred for much of the past year and lead to relatively balanced global oil markets in the second half of 2021"" ""We expect Brent prices will remain near current levels in 3Q21, averaging $68/b."" https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/global_oil.php"
