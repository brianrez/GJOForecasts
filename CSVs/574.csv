But, heading into spring, which will help a bit. Canada won't see 1.1M cases by April 1. Currently, about 4.3k cases/day. If cases stayed absolutely flat at this level, there would be 146.2k more cases by April 30. 965k + 146.2k = 1.11M. I don't see any way that cases will maintain an average as low as 4.3k through April, as B.1.1.7 becomes dominant and control policies are not implemented.

There is apparently a sharp drop in all provinces except from New Brunswick and Saskatchewan and a drop in particular in those provinces with the largest base of total reported cases so far (the main drivers of the pandemic in Canada), namely Alberta, Ontario and Quebec. However, it appears premature to pick a later bin than March for several reasons, the most prominent of which is an earlier observation in the source PHAC's figures: The daily differential of total cases for Canada often times exceeds the figure of daily new confirmed cases significantly (3 to 4 digits) without explanation. Consulting the daily new confirmed cases only could deliver a false impression of the trajectory of the real infection rate, caused by mismatching figures and revisions that are not announced. PHAC's figures are notoriously incomplete and unreliable. I expect Canada to count 150,000 additional cases to cross 900k cases in total over the next three weeks by 17 February 2021 (daily average 7.2k cases), which would leave six more weeks for the remaining 200,000 new cases (average of 4.8k cases per day) to reach 1.1mn cases. If 900k cases will not be reached by the end of February, then April is the most likely outcome of this question."
