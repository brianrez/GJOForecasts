While, all demonstrate degrees of bias, many right-wing media outlets to include mainstream, e.g., FOX, are promoting demonstrably false narratives. Those who live in such an info-sphere will be hard pressed to ever approve of Biden regardless of what he says and does. This results in a baked in disapproval of 38-42 percent. Also baked in is a President in crisis. Pandemic, inflation, and war are challenges a President has little or no control over. But the resultant chaos of such crises also presents opportunities for demonstration of leadership. Recent successes in unifying the West against authoritarian overreach could lead to similars efforts domestically. Centrists are likely to lean towards reality-based leadership. Finally, approval is not a gauge of support. Biden supporters can also disapprove. These factors will likely keep Biden's approval rating between 40-50 percent."

That's a lot, seems off. His SOTU was crafted with statements that poll well and times of war tend to bring the country together, jobs report today was good, and most pandemic restrictions are being lifted across the nation, but oil/gas continue to rise, and so is inflation -- both expected to continue to rise given the war in Ukraine. The 538 polling average is showing 42%.

Similar to Trump, it seems he has a floor of support somewhere around 40%. His support remained in the 50-55% range (honeymoon) until the Delta wave hit the country, then fell further during the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal. COVID (Omicron) is retreating, but it doesn't seem to show up in the numbers. Why? I have no idea. Inflation worries? War? Ukraine has been handled well, IMHO, and should be a positive.
