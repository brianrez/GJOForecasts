A shut-out of the Astros going forward seems VERY unlikely and 3 or 4 wins seem to be the overwhelmingly likely outcomes at this point."

That's 63% chance for Astros according to Laplace's rule of succession. On the other hand, the betting world has ~70% of its bets on the Phillies (which makes sense because many people bet on the underdog to make a huge profit) and only 55% of all the money is on the Astros. Further, the last 10 games' points per game metric is higher for the Phillies than for the Astros. So in a nutshell, Astros are the favorite in terms of betting and data, but not as strongly as their past history, latest history, and what this current GJO crowd consensus is saying."
