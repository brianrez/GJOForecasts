Such still requires Board approval - so this is no rush to judgment. The UAW picked GM as the target company. Contracts expire Sep 14. I get a sense of ""we have to show them"" from the union for all the plant closures - which could argue for a hasty reaction by the UAW should nothing substantive show up by, say, Oct.1 Union leadership is weakened by the corruption allegations - and they may over-correct and strike b/c ""it can"" - and thus project power. But none of that makes a dent in the the trends in a globalized auto production environment. No matter how successful the UAW in this round, things bode poorly for domestic UAW production longer-term as the job-replacing threats come from automation and from the global supply chain. These conditions are now inherent to the industry, and I do not see Mary Barra standing aside and ignoring these conditions. Given what she's done to GM during her tenure as CEO - she looks at things hard, and completely. At a time of general auto market slowdown, her top-line would be impacted anyway - so what's the difference if GM sell less units, or if GM produce less units that would otherwise add to an already overcrowded inventory. GM can probably offer some types of job guarantees and delayed plant closing and some shifting of production - assuming the plants' lines can accommodate or be jiggered. Since the question's outer boundary is Oct 31 - I hold to my de minimus outlook. Nov 1 or beyond is another story - b/c of the apparent frustrations with matters global and local by the rank and file, leading to an overreach."

Considering the forecasts of the economy heading into recession and the decline of auto sales I can see executives at GM considering this future in their negotiations with the UAW. The executives will want to be more conservative with their offerings to be better prepared for the recession. I can envision younger workers, particularly millennials (people most affected by the last recession), will desire more out the contract negotiations to better prepare themselves for tough tidings. That coupled with the turmoil within the upper echelons of UAW makes it less likely for the union to have a unified voice. This will make it more likely for factions within the union to form. I am not so confident that the strike will be approved or led by the UAW International Executive Board but I am confident that resentment amongst the workers are high and that some sort of strike will form."

GM has kept jobs in the US - but not as many as the UAW wanted. GM is a global player. U.S. and global auto sales seem to be stalling. Either 4 or 5 GM plants have been closed. Likely further overseas manufacturing operations are contemplated. Job security or some re-investment in US plants/no-closure promise will be core for the UAW - since I don;t see them reversing global trends for more highly automated manufacturing and outsourcing of various sub-assemblies - such reversal bringing back jobs the way they used to be done. This negotiation is for the next 4 years. A preemptive strike vote is called for the week of Aug 26th. Assessments are that, if implemented, this would be a rolling strike, not a national strike - thus easier for the UAW membership to support , as the burden would be shared from around the plants. But weekly strike benefits are only $250/week - $1,000 per month? - hardly seems like something workers can really support unless they're pushed to the wall --- and that they would be losing their jobs anyway under a wayward GM proposal. Tier 1 workers seem to make straight-time wages of $28/hr and Tier 2 $16/hr - meaning from $40,000 to $60,000 annually Negotiators, so authorized by the membership, could call for a strike anytime during the remaining negotiations, set to expire on Sept 14. I suppose that includes extensions. Though to actually go out on strike, rolling or otherwise, the UAW board needs to vote it into being. So it is possible that the membership votes for a strike, negotiations to go into extra innings, and yet the Board never authorizes an actual strike. I think the Christmas and Thanksgiving holidays would play a role in tamping down the possibility of even a rolling strike."

Assuming that such negotiations happen every four years, this would push up the base rate to something closer to 20% which seems intuitively more accurate."

The UAW does not have a strong history of leading strikes with the big 3 in the 21st century and its influence continues to diminish, so the base case has narrow odds to begin with. Furthermore, there is a tight job market and GM's growth has been steady with the SP 500. GM worker benefits seem in line with industry standard. Thus, the only strong point of contention in the years negotiations in GMs recent plant closures and talks of potentially unallocating 4 additional plants in 2020.
