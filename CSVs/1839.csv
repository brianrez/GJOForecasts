ZANU - PF, the current military apparatus, essentially ZANU - PF dominant, and the alignment with Mnangagwa, essentially keeps the instruments of an autocratic state in place. Mnangagwa, a close ally of Mugabe and the ‘liberation movement structures’ in Southern Africa (and the SADC aligned states), maintain domestic and regional power. Mnangagwa, responsible with Mugabe and ZANU -PF for the slaughter of 100,000s of Ndebele opposition, resistance and civilians, is no different from Mugabe’s autocratic coercion and dictatorial governance. While the current population are elated at recent events, it is necessary to ask whether there is mass illusion, acquiesce, or irrationality at a national and a domestic level. Even though Mnangagwa is currently head of ZANU - PF, will he simply be installed as state president by party rule? Will the ruling party simply bypass the constitutional requirements of electoral processes? Will the military (a coup claimed as a non coup) rule, in the interim to appease international and domestic actors and investors who require stability? The ideological nature of the Zimbabwean population, the state, party ( essentially identical in nature) continues to rest on the Leninist/Stalinist authoritarian paradigm, supported by a majority of SADC states (dressed in democratic policies, but essentially derive from the same ideological roots in the alliances, with the exception of Botswana and perhaps 1 other) will not change its political nature by a ‘non coup event’. The dynamics of authoritarian - relative democratic transition is complex in nature, and requires rebalancing an entire social structure through dynamic ‘revolution’. What does does this portend for violent/ peaceful change? Military structures do not refrain from rule after its taste of power. The empirics of its politics and how it comport with reality belies a reliance on the current mass delusion of democratic change. This leaves the question of whether Zimbabwe will have a president and maintenance of its political structure before 2018? I suspect that it will not occur prior to 2018 without the tightening of international constraints by economic and political actors who seek to democratize the region and Zimbabwe in particular. The vacuum of military rule until president is lawfully I stalled will take some time."

General SB Moyo alluded to some sort of threat to the judiciary. Anyone aware of anybody in Zimbabwe going after the judiciary recently and any interest the military might have in such a situation? Also signaled to the legislature wants them to have funds. Called on veterans to maintain order and cancelled all leave for active duty military; said report to barracks. Political leadership are to encourage their people to be non-violent. He encouraged people to remain indoors unless they have jobs in which case they should go to work. i don't think the phrase ""keep calm and carry on"" was said all it once, but maybe all those words were used."

Zimbabwe media relies more on opinion than information and the international press is no better informed. Some of this is due to partisanship, but it's also clear that there is a dearth of reliable information to draw from. What isn't clear is whether this is a result of deliberate obfuscation from those near to Mugabe, or whether it's because no-one actually has a clue what's going on. 2. There's plenty of scuttlebutt suggesting Grace is next in line, but this would surely be a disastrous decision. Would it be seen as a dynastic succession? If so, it's more likely to galvanize opponents than unite the party and the nation. The problem, however, is that no-one from the inner circle may be able to bring all the factions together. The threat of a coup will be real for some time. 3. Mugabe may be quite mad. At the very least, he is blind to the needs of his people. As he currently spends more time abroad than at home it is hard to know if he is much more than president in-name-only. With this in mind, I don't think it's too silly to wonder if the line about Mugabe being ""president for life"" is more than just talk. If old Bob completely loses his marbles or falls into a coma, will he still officially be president? How might GJO score this question if a) someone is appointed acting president or b) the new president is overthrown within a few weeks?"

He just made a 180 degree turn around, recognizing the failure of his strategic plan for the US. As predicted several years before the US organized the coup in Ukraine, when for me it became clear that US administration is confronting Russia, I have warned my friends in APAC that cornering Russia may endanger the safety of Israel, but surely will dramatically weaken the influence of the USA in the world. Now we see that happening, not because the oligarchs in Washington have overestimated the might of USA, but because they have underestimated the might of Russia. Obama said that Russia is just a regional power. He erred, as in many other things. I would formulate it differently: USA is a superpower, but only if it respects Russia's national interests. Mugabe threatens that the African nations will leave the UN and found a new organization with China an Russia if the West won't move to allow the African nations to have more say in the UN."
