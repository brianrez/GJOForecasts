He also predicts a rise in the spring of more troops and more casualties. The length and depth of these articles leads me to believe he is spending little time updating minor details and focusing on more impactful, significant ones. A change in 5-10k troops when the exact numbers are unknown will go unreported or unverified. As such, I do not expect the estimate to arrive at 200,000 until March, the earliest time that would be considered Spring.

Putin has also changed military leadership of the special military operation {Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff}. New leadership doesn't immediately change numbers. Another item that stands out is Russia losses about 10K soldiers per month (https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3143381/russian-efforts-to-raise-numbers-of-troops-unlikely-to-succeed-us-official-says/). Overall, I put this as unlikely that they will achieve some huge build up and reach 200K."
109237,2023-01-23T01:37:20Z,1,[67.0],[67.0],Russia recently announced expanding pool of men subject to the draft. These men will likely not be available for at least a few months for deployment. But the winter months may be a good time to consolidate and reinforce troops. A spring offensive is a likely scenario.
