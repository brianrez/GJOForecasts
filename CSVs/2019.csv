That plant is about 30 months away from criticality. Easy way to rebuke Erdogan. Despite Putin annoucement almost 3 months ago that the work would not be suspended and that the project would be governed solely by economics, Erdogan-Putin conflict has intensified See http://www.dailysabah.com/energy/2015/12/17/russia-not-to-halt-akkuyu-nuclear-power-plant-in-turkey-putin-says Putin says. Russia needs money. Is Turkey continuing payments? Is it worth a billion in hard currency to Russia? Will Turkey which is subject to extreme economic downturn and calling for NATO to invade Syria, continue payments is key if Putin is to be believed. Looking for ""construction contract"" and ""progress payment"" schedules. That would set a date above and beyond the Russia/Turkey confrontation."

Turkey pounded PYD/YPG targets near Syria's Azaz on Thursday with T-155 Fırtına howitzers, in retaliation for the terrorist organization's cross-border fire into southern border town Kilis. Previously, the military shelled YPG targets near the town of Azaz in northern Syria on Feb. 13, under the rules of engagement and in response to two separate attacks carried out by YPG and Assad forces on a Turkish military base and a police station. http://www.dailysabah.com/politics/2016/02/19/turkey-hits-ypgpyd-targets-with-artillery-rockets"

Broadly, projects get canceled more frequently and at a higher rate than I thought. When looking at the Akkuyu nuclear power plant I looked at both Russia and Turkey interests. Russia is facing financial troubles (list below). There are also recent examples (Bulgaria in 2012) and (Ukraine 2015) of canceled projects of Russian nuclear power projects. Taking into consideration that plants close, Russian plants have closed, Russia debt downgraded, Rubble in trouble, military conflict with Turkey, scientist training suspended… it looks like this plant could close. Now when will it close? We have 12 months for this to happen. I also acknowledge I’m having trouble figuring out a timeline. But since we are in a new year we should expect 2-4 plants close up shop Akkuyu could be one."

Their safety in the event of an attack or malfunction could be compromised. I'm guessing they will try to absorb the financial penalty and look elsewhere for a partner. 55% chance of Turkey canceling.

Relations seem bad at this point in time between the two, and could certainly get to a point where this project could be cancelled or suspended. However, there would be heavy costs for Russia and Turkey if this falls through. Assuming that Putin wants the project to continue for economic reasons and maybe even as a tool that can serve both as a carrot and stick (by delaying work), and that the Turks do not want to delay their projected timeline and incur in possible contract financial sanctions, then I think we are more on the no side. Also, I assume that existing tensions would not escalate to a point of a break in diplomatic ties. Here we go."

In either case, the sunk cost is the same. From the Russian perspective, delay doesn't cost much. All big projects have delays. From the Turkish perspective, no electricity gets produced until the plant is built. Since the plant is Russian BOO (build, own, operate), it's almost a gift to the Turks. Once the plant begins to operate, the Turks have to pay their utility bills, but until then they hardly pay anything. If Turkey wants the plant without the Russians, it will need to find someone else to build it. Good luck with that. It would probably cost twice as much and the economic proposition would be completely different. Even setting aside Russian pressure on tourism and Turkish agricultural exports and the not-so-subtle threat to restrict natural gas shipments, Turkey is not in a good negotiating position here. Once the Russians accept the notion of sunk cost, their BATNA is clearly superior. Collisions can happen. Suspension/cancellation stays on the table. But I'm lowering my forecast."

I'm thinking that there are a lot of things countries will do in terms of both postures and actions that are still short of total cessation of relations. This Akkuyu is perhaps an interesting example of balancing the benefits of co-operation against the benefits of conflict. No doubt, should the relationship deteriorate, the borders will be closed and the project will be suspended or cancelled. (I'm not sure what ""officially"" means here, exactly.) In any case, I'm looking at this as a measure of relational extremis between these two countries, and I do not see it yet; although as @clinton has commented, something goes ""bang"" and it's a whole new situation."

Visa free travel between Russia and Turkey has now come to an end. Russian travel agencies have been warned not to package new offerings. Imports of Turkish agricultural products have been prohibited. Such measures will hurt Turkey more than they will hurt Russia. What about the Akkuyu project? It's big and it has an unusual BOO structure (buy-own-operate). It will be 100% Russian. Turks trained in Russia will work there as employees. The project cost is 20 billion. Three billion have been spent. Here's the problem: the Russians will own something expensive, but it's in another country. If the relationship turns hostile, Akkuyu could turn into a complete loss. Then what? Do you invade a NATO country and try to send out utility bills to the population? This is a classic ""sunk cost"" problem. The best idea is to put the project on hold. Write off the 3 billion (at least for the moment). Save the other 17. Stall on paying any penalties. Wait and see what happens. Oh, and one other thing. Don't forget to remind Turkey how much of its natural gas comes from Russia."

12680,2015-12-09T03:18:28Z,1,[55.0],[55.0],It depends on Russia actually. Looks like Turkey is trying to keep the relation but Russia (Putin actually) takes more serious steps and make the Turkish business man and more importantly Turkish people move out of country by speculative and manipulative pressures in the country. If this continue actually Turkey will take some other steps too and the rope keeping the relation will be more and more tin. Akkuyu is more beneficial to Russian companies then Turkey.
734,2015-12-09T02:19:43Z,1,[55.0],[55.0],"Initial forecast. Would have to grade this at better than even odds given the current issues that arise more from domestic political needs and overinflated egos (on both parts) rather than arising from strategic interests. With the current oil environment (I had forecasted the return of $20 oil not so long ago to a friend) it will be interesting to see how long before the combination of low commodity prices and depleting foreign reserves will curb Putin's enthusiasm for funding this particular project, and for that matter other arenas where he has interjected himself recently."
