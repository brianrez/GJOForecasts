According to an article by Hailemariam Desalegn, the former prime minister of Ethiopia, TPLF officials were concerned these moves were going to threaten their political and economic position in the country. Thus TPLF officials started defying the orders from the federal government and made overt and covert actions to undermine and delegitimize the Ethiopian parliament, defense forces, and the federal government. + There was attemp on his life 2018 involving dissident police officers. + Ethiopia's dispute with Egypt on Renaissance Dam; Egypt has a motive to weaken Ahmed's regime and position."

93350,2021-07-31T08:48:32Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"The fate of Abiy Ahmed lies in the challenges of ruling a country comprising of some 84 ethnic groups where ethnic based federalism is the only way to ‘eliminate entrenched inequalities between ethnic groups inherited from past regimes’ where ethnicity has become an unavoidable feature of politics. This has reportedly fuelled ethnic conflict rather than concentrating on democracy, development, justice and human rights. Due to the diversity, there has been a rise of sub-state nationalism between Oromo, Tigrayan, Somali, and Sidama, the region of Amhara. The Oromo and Amhara constitute 60% of the population where Abiy is Oromo with a Muslim father and a Christian mother who should, on paper be ideal to negotiate his way through the religious diversities and the plurality of the Ethiopians. The recent elections declared a victory in the recent election it has been considered flawed by the EU and the US where only held in 400 0f the 550 districts in the country, especially in Tigray. Tigray appears to be Abiy Ahmed’ s Achilles’s heel in dealing with the ethnic based federalism but is a symptom rather than the cause of civil war. The other major challenge is that of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) that is creating instability in the region and potential conflict with Egypt and the Sudan. The diverse nature of the Ethiopian country is too entrenched to be encased in a federal system of government and given the popularity of sub-state nationalism does give doubt to the rise of another leader to oppose and be a threat to Abiy Ahmed as Prime Minister. There does not appear (reported) to be any threat form the National armed forces to forge a coup. Abiy Ahmed does appear to have an impossible task but given the lack of any other credible leadership, I will suggest that he remains in power for the foreseeable future."
