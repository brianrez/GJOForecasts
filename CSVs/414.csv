AWS uses the retail side as way to test products before launch, and solicit features to build. Retail gets discounted services, and a large org that will make tools for them. It is a very symbiotic relationship. There is no ""harm"" to them staying together, except the political risk - which is small since its a fringe discussion from a political party that is likely losing influence across 2022. Based on this, Amazon has no strong urgency to consider this path in the near future. There is no rumors or claims from amazon about a spin-off being seriously considered, and that is a major task for a company that size, so Iis unlikely that any formal announcement is near (even if it does occur one day due to changing politics)."

This profit is used to enable aggressive discounting in e-commerce (Amazon's products on amazon.com) and brick and mortar stores (WholeFoods), driving revenue growth in these areas. - If we measure public perception of Amazon via its stock price, this has been at an all-time high since August 2020.

It is doubtful that such a move could create value for shareholders as Amazon.com runs on AWS and it is clear from the history of the company that AWS is tightly integrated with the rest of the company. Since AWS constitutes much of the underlying infrastructure of the rest of the company it makes no sense to split it off. Amazon uses funds from AWS to research and enter new industries and it has an excellent record of innovative success. Spinning off AWS would significantly disrupt this model of growth. Not sure how regulators could make a case that Amazon with AWS is a monopoly and spinning it off would fix it.
