I may also have been downplaying the credibility of Stoltenberg/NATO leadership, and statements from the US which state there are no countries opposed to accession. While I still would prefer statements from each nation's leadership, I am increasingly thinking NATO/US statements of no opposition are a reasonable proxy for other country's NATO representatives.

[2] Government report due by April, ruling SDP will meet in 2 April, Basic Finns in 30 April, Greens in 21-22 May, Left in 10-12 May, Center in 10-12 June (though position will be resolved through the spring). The decision to join NATO will ultimately come down to parliament and thus these parties, but President Niinisto and PM Marin have a good deal of influence if they choose to speak up. Current status on the party positions [3]: Center and Swedish People's Party were long supporters of NATO. Greens and Finns party are quickly becoming in favour. Ruling SDP is divided, with PM Marin's actions hinting at a pro-NATO view but divisions in her party which would make it difficult. The Center party is split and going through debate. Based on the current Finnish parliament [4], NATO support would need around 50 members to switch sides towards yes. Splits in the Greens, Finns, and Center would be enough for a weak majority. Ideally it would be a strong majority though, so the majority in the Greens, Finns, and Center, along with some SDP. In my opinion, for Finland to support NATO requires 1) the government report / Niinisto to suggest NATO membership has more benefits than drawbacks, 2) split or majority votes in the currently deciding parties, 3) for the vote to happen in autumn or early winter which it seems on track for, and 4) for the government to continue its work in the background meeting with western partners to gauge security promises, which has been ongoing."
