"Before 1 January 2018, will the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration grant a waiver allowing Amazon to test its unmanned aerial vehicles?",2017-01-06T18:00:14Z,2018-01-01T07:59:14Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Technology'],1434,654,414,237,"Amazon completed its first drone delivery in the U.K., the debut of its unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) shipping service (The Guardian). U.S. commercial drone rules were finalized at the end of August 2016 (FAA). Among other things, they require operators to maintain visual line of site with the drones (FAA, Fortune). Since passing the regulation, U.S. regulators have been granting waivers for companies to test drone delivery (FAA). 7-Eleven, which became the first major company to use drones for deliveries in the U.S.,did so without a waiver because its drone operators maintained line of site for short range delivery (CNBC).

The advice they take regarding cyberpolicy is all coming from the tech giants who do, and will continue to rule a corporate owned internet. Cluelessness at the highest level was demonstrated by Jeff Sessions at Senate Committee hearings, proving that, arguably, the White House's top ""performer"" knows nothing. That means our whole government is putting our security, therefore our national security in the hands of these tech giants. From an old hacker's perspective, my own, I'd interpret Russia's actions, including all election tampering, as an exercise and a dare. It is a dare to see if the Americans are still taking the world seriously. And, the Russians encourage hacking rather than prosecuting people for dissent just for speaking about it. And hacking is a very broad field, a science of reverse engineering. In Russia, they know the difference between hacking and social engineering. It is absolutely vital for all Americans to understand this difference moving forward."

Upon OMB approval of its Emergency clearance request, FAA will follow the normal clearance procedures for the information collection associated with LAANC” (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/10/11/2017-21878/request-for-emergency-processing-of-collection-of-information-by-the-office-of-management-and-budget) The LAANC will improve the safety of drones flying in controlled airspace, however I don’t think that this implementation will have an impact on Amazon’s UAV testing by the end of the year.

On May 31st at a Drone Conference, Elaine Chow (Secretary of Transportation) preached the need for Sillicon Valley firms to share with the public their understanding of their own products, as well as the safety and privacy concerns regarding drones. She also spoke about how the FAA is currently undertaking studies in order to determine the parameters for safe drone flight over people, and admitted that it has been a labor intensive and occasionally frustrating process. Couple this concern over safety/privacy, the fact that the regulation is still squarely in the ""research and study"" phase, and the relative paralysis of the entire government due to so much political capital being wrapped up in healthcare and the growing Russia scandal, I give a 20% likelihood that Amazon will receive a waiver before January 1st 2018.

Rules such as: §107.35: Operation of multiple small unmanned aircraft systems, requires the applicant to ""Provide a method to resolve failure of single and multiple aircraft or systems simultaneously."" At their test site in Cambridge, UK, only one drone was operated autonomously, it is possible that they've tested multiple drones simultaneously at their private sites. Legislation passed by a House Panel approved Rep. Bill Shuster's legislation that would set rules for drone delivery, beyond -line-of-sight operations, and agreeing on a unified air traffic management system. The bill calls for: • ""The secretary of transportation to decide within 120 days whether or not air traffic management systems are a viable choice for the problem at hand."" • ""The FAA to allow flights farther than the pilot can see within six months at six testing regions nationwide."""

Additionally, Amazon has fulfillment centers in Illinois, Southern California, Dallas, etc. which are all homes to heavy air traffic. If Amazon plans on deploying drones to delivery to their main customer base (out of each fulfillment center), it will not get cleared by the FAA to operate in the vicinity of airports. 25% chance as it currently stands.

To be exact there have been 318 waivers granted for FAR 107. Only 7 waivers have had multiple FAR 107 waiver requests. Only 2.2% of FAR 107 waivers have had multiple FAR 107 line item waivers. The waiver for BNSF Railway is the closest multi-point waiver that could be compared to a Amazon waiver. But we must consider BNSF is not asking to operate over people, at night, and higher weight limits etc etc. Considering this outside view of 2.2% I should have a much lower forecast for this GJO question right?

The FAA is behind granting waivers to anyone for any reason because of the extremely rapid growth in requests; even search and rescue operations are waiting 90 days. The technology is advancing so rapidly, any ruling on how to manage automation will already be inadequate in a year. Plus, it may take a year of study to make a ruling on waivers for automated drones. The Europeans have already developed and tested automated drone delivery; we know this works, but to do this on a commercial scale is hugely complex and costly."

I found two documents that broadly discuss Amazon Prime Airs' vision for UAS operations. Both documents seem to reflect long-term sustainable UAS operations much like Blue Origin.

They are working with NASA to develop & test a drone traffic monitoring system but this is not due for completion until 2019. Trump has expressed an interest in privatising air traffic management and replacing the FAA. The new entity might move quicker on such issues but it would still take some time to set up the new organisation(s) and look at waivers/rule changes. additionally, while ultimately drone technology is likely to be used increasingly for commercial purposes, it is still in its infancy. Amazon will be pressing the FAA and government to act sooner on the issue but I think for the time being they are likely to be quite happy undertaking their testing and refining the technology in the UK and other countries."
