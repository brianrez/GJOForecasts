Kramp-Karrenbauer could just be confirmed and/or re-elected, which in the possible answers would be the ""someone else"" answer: the pressure on her party CDU has somewhat lifted, since the SARS-CoV-2 response and its success has been solely assigned to Mrs. Merkel and her CDU. She just repeatedly stressed, that under no circumstance will she once more apply for a seat in parliament nor being elected chancellor. The need for a re-orientation after 15+ years under Merkel's leadership will remain, more so as general elections are scheduled for 2021. However, discussions and eventualities brought forward now concerning the future personnel could harm the current impression of unity within CDU/CSU, and a constructive quietude. Unless she makes bigger mistakes as the party leader or will leave more negative impressions of her work as minister of defence, A. Kramp-Karrenbauer will be confirmed in her position for the sake of peace within the party. It seems the congress had been ""cancelled"" for that date in December in the meantime (or rather put on stand by, I would say), but that @pstamp does not exclude for the next weeks and months, that the same special congress will be re-scheduled to e.g. September when large gatherings with 1,000 participants or more are likely to be admitted again. Circumstances due to the pandemic change fast this year, and it looks as if political processes have started rolling again now. I would rather read the last answer as ""No successor will be selected at the special party congress or there will be no special party congress before 1 Jan 2021 happening"". Therefore, no early resolution possible before 31 Dec 2020."

The background is similar to my post on 21 April: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/1018969 It´s not the first part of that (you´re right about that contradicting opening football) but the second. As a result of very popular crisis management Söder (CSU) will most probably be the candidate of CDU and CSU together for German chancellor after Merkel. 1) The job of party leader of the CDU is only attractive for the candidates, if they have a chance to get chancellor. The candidates with best chances to get elected (Laschet and Merz) would have nothing to gain from ""just being party leader"" without a perspective for more. Much work, little income, little real power. They could only loose. 2) Current leader Kramp-Karrenbauer is in a much better position now than she was a few months ago, so there is no urgent need to replace her. 3) As AKK and others announced, the population would not understand a public power struggle in times of crisis. That´s very true. The mainly left-wing german media would hang them for that."

The congress will be held by delegates, not ordinary party members. They will decide on a basis that helps them keep their personal power. Under Merkel the CDU for several reasons in many aspects turned towards left-wing/green politics (they strategically had to, to be precise). Many of the parties voters consider that good, others don´t (I don´t!). Merz would lead the party back to a more conservative track. That might get some voters back from AfD, but more could be lost to SPD or the green Party, so in the end it could be bad for overall results in elections. That´s a relevant strategic point, and even I would consider it more valid than having my personal favourite candidate Merz as the new party leader. A good compromise from a delegate´s point of view will be the team of Laschet (moderate boss) and Spahn (conservative deputy). As said before: I´m not neutral in this question, but you won´t get deeper insight on it elsewhere."

Some things to consider: the congress is postponed to ""as soon as the epidemic allows"". That could be in a few weeks, but definitely will take place long before 1 Jan 21, and it won´t be cancelled, because the party needs a new leader after Kramp-Karrenbauer gave up. About the candidates: Merz is my favourite, and for most in the CDU too. He´s a selfmade-millionaire top lawyer and manager for Blackrock and an old enemy of Merkel (a rival she got rid of long ago, so he just decided to make lots of money in between). The party leadership and most likely most of the delegates in the congress prefer Laschet, because with him cooperation with the left-wing green party would be much easier (and cooperation with them is necessary for several relevant reasons). Röttgen is brilliant and would be a great choice, but he is the ""outsider"" here, without any real backing by relevant groups. Much more important is ""someone else"": Health Minister Spahn could decide to go for it himself instead of just backing up Laschet. He is conservative but not the green partie´s ""declared enemy"" like Merz and ist just gaining lots of reputation for his cool management of the corona crisis. I don´t think, that he will do it now, because he is young and can wait for a better chance. As ""wingman"" of Laschet their chances together are higher than those of Merz alone."

I also think it is unlikely that there will be more candidates in the race, as the current persons embody the two political trends in the CDU. Also they are already endorsed by the two big strongholds of the CDU in Germany, NRW and BW, so even if there is another candidate, he is unlikely to win. I expect a close race between Merz and Laschet with a slight higher probability for Merz. I consider him more competent (can be important as the leader of the CDU is a likely candidate for competing as Bundeskanzler) and most of the CDU members favour him (attention has to be paid to the mechansim for the election: the leader is voted by delegates, not by ordinary members)."

However, we can look at the possibilities of ignoring the cancellation. I believe Armin Laschet is the most likely to succeed Angela Merkel because he takes the moderate tone of Merkel. This comes down to an issue of whether the CDU wants to take a more conservative or more moderate tone. The move to ally with the AfD showed huge repercussions and it would be hard to see a conservative candidate be able to establish a majority in German politics. Laschet would be most likely because he takes a moderate tone in the face of the growing appeal of the green party."
