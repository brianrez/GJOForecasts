You must be a registered Republican to participate, but you can register at your caucus location with proof of address and a valid ID. And, as Ivanka Trump points out in her how-to-caucus video, Republicans will be casting a secret ballot-- once. No need to plan your evening around convincing the neighbors you don't know that well to stand in your candidate's group, and no need to worry about those same folks remembering who you supported if your allegiance might be termed impetuous. This argues for a strong Trump showing, particularly if social media gets cranked up (""Print your cell bill and go! #Showing up for Trump""). Lines of people bearing utility bills aren't likely to be Cruz supporters; his campaign touts a strong [traditional] ground game. With this said, the weather will be a factor locally.

In my opinion Trump is less of a candidate than the media and polls makes him out to be but his chances of winning are still above 20%. Putting him at 25%.

When a little old lady in Jersey refused his enormous offers for her property, and imminent domain was denied (she had a homestead) he built his parking lot completely around her home and encased it with fencing which was her view of the world till she died. J.B Hunt lost more money in the 87 stock crash than Trump has ever had, He isn't that big, except in the Middle East and Turkey where he has many joint property ventures.

The only thing which will change outcome are three factors. 1. Weather: This may be the most critical factor. In prior Iowa caucus events, horrid weather directly change numbers of attendees. 2. Bloviation vs dedication: This could still be a factor. I have a perspective that Trump supporters are high on bloviation, but not necessarily on carry through.

But likely caucusgoers' opinions of the ultraconservative Texas U.S. senator remain sky high (76 percent view him favorably). ... In third place with likely GOP caucusgoers is Marco Rubio, with 12 percent, and Ben Carson is huddled close behind at 11 percent. Those are precarious perches, because a majority of their supporters say they could still be persuaded to support someone else, said Iowa Poll pollster J. Ann Selzer. ... A majority of likely caucusgoers, 56 percent, could change their minds about their first-place choice or still do not have a first choice, the poll finds. ... The Iowa Poll of 500 likely Republican caucusgoers was conducted Jan. 7-10 by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. ... While Cruz's lead of 10 percentage points on Trump in early December has whittled to 3 points, underlying data show Cruz to be well-positioned. The constitutional lawyer is the second-choice pick for more voters than any other candidate. And he attracts almost half the electorate when percentages of first- and second-choice preferences are combined, Selzer noted. ... Cruz may be boxed in tactically when it comes to attacks: 75 percent of likely caucusgoers view his decision generally to avoid criticizing Trump as a favorable trait."""

It is spending considerable amount of money for advertising through various media outlets. Recent media reports indicate that their is also a trend rejecting media advertising by racist/white supremacist organizations. Its ability to ride and influence the Trump 'wave' in Iowa might move Trump over the victory line in caucusing in the state. Cruz however is advantaged by a strong organization on the ground in Iowa. How the recent debates about his eligibility for president as a 'natural born' citizen affects supporters and potential independent voters in the state is not estimable at this stage. Professor Tribe at Harvard (both teacher and mentor for Obama and Cruz) has indicated that the Supreme Court has not taken this question up and that their is considerable murkiness with regard to the legal interpretation of this question. Media reports indicates willingness among democrats to seek a ruling through the judicial system were Cruz to be selected as the nominee for the Republican Party. Tribe has indicated, contra Cruz, that his status (as a potential president) is not as clear as Cruz claims. These two dynamics could have considerable influence on the outcomes of primary in Iowa."

The Register's campaign tracker listed 25 Huckabee events between January 2 and now, second only to the 28 Sen. Cruz planned between January 4 and 9. Clearly, both men consider Iowa vital to their future success. But will either be able to quickly lock up a room come caucus night? Evangelical participants-- the target audience for both-- have several self-identified candidates from which to choose, and will see them regularly in the next two weeks: Cruz, Huckabee, Dr. Carson (13 events listed between January 6 and 11) and Sen. Santorum (11 events listed between January 7 and 12). Supporters may work long and hard to come to a consensus on February 1st."

It definitely is not surprising given the fact that Cruz appears to be the favorite and Trump resorts to these types of tactics approximately always. Despite the circus that will likely continue, according to polls and just thinking rationally from a strategic standpoint for the Republican party, it appears Cruz has more allies and is a frontrunner more so now than he has been. Trump will still be a contender, naturally, and will continue to pursue extreme tactics that can certainly swing the needle."

The second thing is the lack of political savvy. I have worked with these guys, and have had them as neighbors. We have engaged in political discussion. The one thing I have noticed is that even though they are registered to vote, they don't. (That last statement is based upon some post election polling, and also checking on the voter rolls. When getting out the vote, I have checked to see when the last time neighbors have voted, and am amazed how many do not.) And this is in the general elections -- caucuses are a higher bar. First, precincts are not necessarily the normal polling place. If new to the process, it is best to have someone tell you when and where to show up. And if you are late, the doors are closed and you don't get in. Once you are in, you have to stick around for awhile for the vote.

I still do not know if he can sustain it into the New Year — but after the Paris attacks, his stance on illegal immigration and unverified people coming into our nation has real impact.” But his hold on Iowa and Nevada is more tenuous, according to insiders who note those states’ caucuses require significant organizational muscle to produce a win. GOP insiders now have Cruz nudging Trump out of the lead in Iowa. That prediction came even before a Quinnipiac University poll this week showed the Texan running neck and neck with Trump. Neurosurgeon Ben Carson was the only other candidate to register significantly on this question. It’s the first time Cruz has led on this measure — after months of Trump and, briefly, Carson in front. “I remain skeptical that Donald Trump's organization could turn out enough supporters today to win, and Ben Carson is fading on growing concerns that he's simply not up for the job,” said an Iowa Republican. “Cruz has been building — and continues to build — a solid organization.

Marco Rubio is hanging back right now, and his more centrist policies may not sell in the corn belt, although I would pick him the likely Republican Candidate still standing after the Primary's and Jeb Bush has all ready started conserving funds and reducing staff (which was heavy to begin with) and lacks the fire and authenticity this election will require of the winner."

Trump has recently hired some experienced campaigners to work for his team on the ground in that state in the coming days. The key reason for Trump having a small but realistic chance in my opinion there is time and potential for the current front runner Ben Carson to make a series of gaffes and/or strategic mistakes between now and February that cause his electorate to find other candidates to vote for in the republican field. Also, with the lead, he will come under greater scrutiny from other candidates and the media.

I would love to have a President (Republican or Democrat) who has run a successful business and truly cares for the American People not their personal agenda. But I'm a dreamer.

Once conservatives start calling him out on policy, he may wind up tongue-tied, shrill, and incoherent. He's taken quite a few positions that conservative voters don't like, and it won't be easy for him to square that with them."

3841,2015-10-05T15:40:35Z,1,[17.0],[17.0],"I welcome any comments on how I arrived at this conclusion and on how it could be improved. 1) Polls are a prediction of an event if it were held today. The problem is that this event is four months away. I had a bit of trouble in finding old polls, but I did find: 2012 Santorum won - but in Oct 2011 he was at 3% in Iowa. 2008 Huckabee won - in Oct 2007 he was tied for second at 13%. I believe that Bush was leading at this stage in 2000 and went on to win, but I think that his lead was larger than Trump's. 2) I also looked at the Democrats to see what had happened - Obama won Iowa in 2008 and was at 22% on October 2007. Kerry won in 2004 and he was at 9% at this stage. (I am simply using it to see how indicative presidential polls are at this stage.) 3) Santorum with just 3% at this stage in 2012 has gone on to win Iowa. So in looking at the RCP polls averages, I'll eliminate Pataki, Graham, Santorum, Christie, Gilmore, and Kasich as they are all polling below 3%. 4) That leaves nine - Trump, Carson, Fiorina, Cruz, Rubio, Bush, Huckabee, Jindal, and Paul. All things being equal 100 divided by 9 is an 11% chance. Leads do mean something historically so Trump has a better chance than someone polling much lower. I think there is also a chance that someone (Paul?) will drop out of the race by then and/or fall further in the polls. So I will give Trump 1 out of 8 based on someone dropping out/falling further and a bump to 1 out of 6 based on his lead."
1850,2015-10-05T15:10:39Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"Trump has peaked already and is starting to do nothing but fall.
