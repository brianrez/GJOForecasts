They have agreed to try to hold another referendum by the end of 2023. They will need to allow at least a year to negotiate with the Westminster government and/or drag it through the courts, and to allow 3 months prior to a referendum. They will want the public to either have had the referendum in late 2023, or have been disappointed by Westminster around that time, as that will give both parties an axe to grind during the May 2024 general election campaign. And the longer the Tories stay in power, the better for the chance of a vote for independence. All of these factors push a referendum date to late 2023, which means the section 30 request has go in in late 2022 or early 2023.

It has been quite time consuming and I do have other interests such as coming to terms with the Russian Language, writing and learning the mouth organ (blues based) I did read that to be any good at forecasting one had to be proficient at puzzles and board games; I like neither. I do have an opinion that sports forecasts should be left to the bookmakers and punters. Anyway, my response to the question is the SNP are wasting their time and should be concentrating on educating their children and sorting out their drug problem. Thanks for you time and goodbye."

However, timing is important. There's four and a half years left in this parliament, and in the abstract it's not obvious why 2022 - likely still very much dominated by the pandemic - would be the 'right time' to start the timer on Indyref 2. There has been discussion in the press about Sturgeon stepping down - it all seems to be speculation rather than sourced, so I wouldn't put any serious weight on it, but if there's any chance of this then it would push the referendum further into the future.

The next election will be held on or before May 2025. The SNP’s limited coalition has been formed to give the SNP a majority in Holyrood which has also allowed to Green MSPs into government. This might create issues in the future given the comments made by the Spectator magazine as describing the Scottish Greens as ‘ unhinged, eccentric and outside the mainstream’. (to say the least). Sturgeon in her election declarations stated that she wanted a referendum in the the first half of her Parliamentary term which would suggest some time in 2023. Assuming at least a 12-month period to prepare such a large-scale referendum, the discussions (if allowed) would have to be completed by the beginning of 2023, which suggest Sturgeon’s program to commence talks in 2022. The UK Government Scottish Secretary, Alister Jack has suggested that could be agreement to an independence referendum if sustained opinion polling shows a 60% support for holding it is achieved. This has been dismissed by Sturgeon probably due to the current +/- 44% support. She has agreed that the Covid pandemic must be fought through prior to her pushing for the UK Government to accede to negotiations (doubtful at this stage) which precludes 2021, then a formal request to commence the talks would on her plan begin in 2022. Given her up and coming legal issues with claims of fraudulent activities in the SNP financial accounts, the out-of-control drug deaths in Scotland and now the precarious nature of her Green based majority, Sturgeon would need the distraction of an IndyRef2 as soon as possible."

It was only ever going to have a tiny impact on our economy and the Covid thing has obscured to what extent it will be anyway. Sooner is best for independence chances I reckon."

The UK government will therefore not be minded to open discussions concerning Article 30 order. The SNP and Scottish Greens have fundamental differences in policies but a limited coalition has added 7 seats to the SNP’s 64, that has now provided a majority in Parliament to request independence discussions with the UK government. The SNP’s raison d’etre with Sturgeon at its head is to achieve Independence for Scotland, as is the Greens. It is conceivable that a Supreme Court opinion, to circumvent an article 30 order, will find against the Scottish Parliament as it would be a political issue rather than a point of law. The UK government can disassociate itself from this by letting a private citizen in Scotland, take the lead and challenge the bill in the Court of Session and deny Sturgeon any headlines. Problems are mounting for Sturgeon in that the SNP auditors ‘have included an unprecedented statement about fraud in the party’s new accounts as police investigate potential criminality around the Indyref2 fundraising’. This will hurt both Sturgeon and her husband, Peter Murrell who is the chief executive of SNP. This has been admitted and stated that an equivalent sum will be added to the funds. This does suggest irregularities. Scotland has more drug deaths than any other country in Europe (3 times than that of England and Wales. Given the demands from her party to hold a referendum and pressure from the opposition over the out-of-control drug deaths together with potential fraud issues, Sturgeon requires a distraction and her majority in the Scottish Parliament (with the Greens) will provide one in the form of a request for Article 30 discussions to commence. Another indication is that the SNP have increased the number of press officers (spin doctors) by 42% over the last years that suggests a ramping up of a PR program with one aim in mind – IndyRef2. I suggest she therefore proceed sooner rather than later before she overwhelmed by problems."
