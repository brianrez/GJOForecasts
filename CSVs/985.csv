There are two reasons. First, Iowans take seriously their participation in the country’s first contest. Both Selzer and Monmouth find around 40% have firmly made up their minds, but 45% in the Selzer poll say they “could be persuaded” and 13% haven’t made a choice. The comparable Monmouth numbers are 52% still “open” and 5% with no choice yet. Second, Iowa Democratic Party rules say that if a caucus participant’s preferred candidate doesn’t receive 15% of the vote in the attendee’s precinct, then he must chose another candidate or head home to await final results. Selzer finds 32% undecided or supporting candidates with less than 15% total support; Monmouth has around 26%. These voters’ second-choice preferences are likely to be especially important. The two recent polls provide conflicting guidance as to where these people will break when their candidates lose. Selzer says Ms. Warren gets 16% as a second choice, Mr. Buttigieg 15% and Messrs. Biden and Sanders 12% each. Monmouth finds that 23% pick Ms. Warren as their second choice, vaulting her to first place. Fifteen percent say Mr. Buttigieg is their second choice, 14% pick Mr. Sanders and only 10% choose Mr. Biden, the same percentage who would turn to Ms. Klobuchar. How this plays out depends on which candidates lack 15% in which of the state’s 1,681 precincts and what the field above them looks like in each meeting place. No candidate’s support will be consistent across the state. Iowa used to punch the tickets of three candidates to proceed. This year, winners and losers in Iowa will be judged more by how they meet expectations than by vote percentage. The most likely outcome is that Ms. Warren and Messrs. Biden, Sanders and Buttigieg split Iowa’s 41 delegates roughly equally, with Ms. Klobuchar perhaps grabbing a couple. The Democratic presidential race is as up for grabs at this point as any in modern U.S. electoral history. That means buckle up: There are lots of surprises and plenty of turmoil ahead.“ https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-four-way-race-for-iowa-11579133565"

My intuition is based primarily on the jaw-dropping bias of the moderator last night, who rejected Sanders' denial that he had said that a woman couldn't get elected. I think this feeds into the - somewhat justified - perception by Sanders' supporters that he can't get a fair shake from the press or the Democratic Party. So I think the whole controversy subtracts Warren voters and adds them to Sanders' total."

Recent Iowa polls give him an edge [1] and I think there is more 'energy' surrounding his campaign than Biden per say. I think the large outstanding question I'm personally interested in is how much strategic voting plays a roll. In caucus's it's easier to vote strategically. Sanders and Warren seem to have very similar bases, and so if Warren supporters see that Warren will not win here, will they shift their support to Sanders? It seems like a definite possibility."
