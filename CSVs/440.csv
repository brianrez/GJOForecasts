Whew!There are arguably emerging signs (1) the headline number peaked with last month's 8.6% figure. And the latest inflation numbers from Germany and Spain appeared to defy consensus in some ways, even though the former number was lower than expected (2) and the latter was higher (3). Regardless, even my most extreme guess would not be below 5% for this month (I'm thinking above 8% again, but perhaps more like 8.1%).

Notably, such a rate of decline happened during the start of recessions or sharp economic slowdowns. Assume a base rate of only 4% chance of this happening. The current inflationary situation closely resembles the year 2008 where a sharp increase in inflation rate of 5% quickly collapses to low single digit rate. Oil prices shot to a very high price then due to oil supply shocks from the Kuwait war, which is similar to the current year situation where the Ukrainian war unfolds. Therefore, a high chance of inflation quickly collapses due to a sudden recession following an economic bubble and supply shock is highly likely in the current year as in 2008. Nevertheless, in 2008, such a rapid decline happen very quickly over the span of 4 months, with a decline sharper than 43% only in 1 month time. Usually, the rate of inflation will show signs of slowing down before a rapid descent, which is no where what has transpired in the last few months of 2022. Even if a recession that leads to a sharper decline in inflation rate by 48% will occur this year, using the 2008 crisis as a reference, there could be 8.33% (1/12) chance of it happening this year, which is higher than the base rate. But the caveat earlier about the inflation rate should slow down before it happens, the probability should be even lower. However, I will also point out that such high inflation digit of 8.6% in May, is 3 percent higher than the peak in 2008. Such a high inflation would mean the drastic decline below 5% is also even more likely, which is not even low compared the peak in 2008 of 5.6% and far higher than any month in the last 20 years. Not to mention, although there isn't a slowdown in inflation rate, the inflation rate has plateaued for 3 months since March, which indicates inflation rate is poised to slow down."

Noting that the March 2022 inflation rate was 8.5 and April 2022 was 8.3 it seems that inflation is tapering. The mistake here is to confuse the relative change (Mar 21 to Mar 22 vs Apr 21 to Apr 22) with the absolute increase.

While raw material prices are likely to drop due to economic concerns and Chinese shutdowns, that will take a long time to make much of an impact to consumer prices. Most other categories will remain high due to staffing shortages and supply chain problems that are going to re-accelerate due to strict lockdowns in China.

Substitution theory keeps the CPI relatively stable due to this adjustment. Real inflation however in energy costs supply chain challenges and the perceived scarcity of products has made consumers willing to pay more for staple items which potentially offsets substitution. I would expect to see a rise in the CPI however financial market sensitivity to showing CPI rising to quickly will put pressure on CPI analysts to find ways to bias the CPI report towards a stable increase between 0-2% to control perception and create stability even if real inflation is occurring. At some point real inflation may overcome the variables that can be manipulated at their disposal and will have to accept real inflation and the CPI headline will increase above 2%.

Too many dollars chasing too few goods is going to cause a rise in price levels. At this point, the Fed probably can't raise interest rates quickly enough to fight inflation without inflicting massive economic damage. There's still a chance that supply chain issues will get worked out more quickly than I anticipate and inflation will subside, but, at this point, I think the feared ""wage-price spiral"" is almost independent of supply costs and isn't likely to subside until the next economic slowdown."

Here are not seasonally adjusted numbers: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCNS Jan 2022: 281.148 June 2021: 271.696 My analysis this month remains very similar to my analysis last month. 7 months into the year ending June 2022, inflation is already at 3.5%. Prices would need to fall for the CPI to be in any of the first 3 bins, and I just can't picture that happening by June. Prices would have to increase by no more than 0.52% vs. now over the next entire 5 months for the forecast to stay in bin 4; by comparison, prices rose 0.6% just from Dec to Jan. It's quite possible that increases could slow, but they would have to slow a lot even for the CPI to end up in bin 5. For the % change to stay under 5.0%, the CPI would need to be <285.281, which would require < (285.281/281.148 - 1) * 100% = 1.470% increase over the 5 months from Jan 22 to Jun 22. Given that the CPI has increased 3.5% in the past 7 months, this would represent a slowing of price increases by ~41% over the coming 5 months. I do expect inflation to return to close to the long-term trend at some point, but I just can't picture that happening in the next 5 months, especially as fertilizer prices are up, China is working to end small Delta and Omicron outbreaks repeatedly, shipping is still strained, supply chains are still strained in general, and Russia is about to invade Ukraine (which some are expecting to cause oil prices to go up a lot, among other things). If prices increase as much in the next 5 months as they have in the past 7 months, inflation will be solidly in bin 6. Watch and wait."

I.e. it typically changes by around 0.5% month-to-month, often by much less than that, and only rarely more than 1% in the last decade. I think inflation in 2021 was caused by a rebound in the global economy post-Covid which is likely to continue this year especially with the return of tourism in the US - likely to push travel, accommodation, insurance and dining costs back up. It was also caused by supply chain problems, which are likely to resolve over the next 6 months, especially at the US end of the supply chains. A big drop in demand from China, which is facing multiple internal crises, is likely to dampen prices in commodities and China's purchases from the US. I therefore expect inflation overall to drop, but not much. You also have to factor in that the last 6 months of data show inflation averaging 6-7%, so inflation would have to drop dramatically to pull down that average below 5%."

Interest rates were at a short-term nadir in Jan 1977 (4.6%), then peaking in May 1981 at 19.3%. It wasn't until 1983 that we see CPI drop below the Jan 1977 level.

The average from 2011-2021 has been 2.000%. In the 2011-2021 period, the standard deviation in the annual inflation rate has been 1.308. With zero economics background, upon searching what can cause a high CPI, I found low unemployment and high wages to be one of the main factors. While unemployment rose from 3.7% to 8.1% during the pandemic, the annual CPI growth rose from 1.3% in December of 2019 to 7.123% in December of 2020. This disagrees with the CPI to employment relation outlined. There must be other factors affecting the CPI. After surveying other factors, it seems like the pandemic likely inhibited production of goods in numerous industries, causing a low supply. When I plotted the annual growth rate with the number of COVID cases in the world, I saw no correlation between the waves of the virus and the growth rate. Even during the months where the cases were minimum, the consumer confidence remained high. The growth rate has been on a constant rise ever since the pandemic, regardless of the number of cases. A linear regression on the growth rates from April-2021 to December-2021 revealed a slope of 0.010723, which predicts an annual growth rate of 7.581 in June of 2022 with a standard deviation of 0.9 in growth rates from April-2021 to December-2021. I wasn't sure how to convert this to probabilities for each of the ranges, but it seemed likely that the growth rates will stay above 5% unless the pandemic ends in the next 6 months. Possible factors I can think of that could cause it to drop may be effective vaccinations allowing workers to go back, or unemployment becoming a larger factor in consumption as compared to high-demand-low-supply. Since the growth rate didn't drop even when the cases were at a low and safety seemed to be less of a concern, I felt that this was an unlikely scenario. Demand suddenly dropping also seemed unlikely unless a high number of people were to lose their jobs."

Prices would need to fall for the CPI to be in any of the first 3 bins, and I just can't picture that happening by June. Prices would have to increase by no more than 0.581% vs. now over the next entire 6 months for the forecast to stay in bin 4. It's quite possible that increases could slow, but they would have to slow a lot even for the CPI to end up in bin 5. The CPI is at 280.192 for Dec 21 and was at 270.981 for Jun 21. For the % change to stay under 5.0%, the CPI would need to be <284.530, which would require < (284.530/280.192 - 1) * 100% = 1.55% increase for Dec 21 to Jun 22. Given that the CPI has increased 3.4% in the past 6 months, this would represent a slowing of price increases by 46% over the coming 6 months. I do expect inflation to return to lower levels at some point, but I just can't picture that happening in the next 6 months, especially as fertilizer prices are up, China is working to end small Delta and Omicron outbreaks repeatedly, shipping is still strained, and supply chains are still strained in general. If prices increase as much in the next 6 months as they have in the past 6 months, inflation will be solidly in bin 6. Watch and wait."

That's just for 4 months. And I don't see prices going down in the time scale of this forecast, as we continue to deal with supply chain issues, including shipping constraints and repercussions of the energy situation in China. I do think it's likely that some underlying causes of inflation will start to improve by June (e.g., shipping, the chip shortage, energy demand in China after winter passes), but I don't see how inflation will be <4.0%, and I think >5.0% is most likely. I will be very surprised if we're not at at least 4.0% by February 2022, if not more (i.e., from June 2021 to Feb 2022), and I suspect that we'll add at least another 1.0% increase in the 4 remaining months after that. The only way I think the CPI could end up <4.0% is if there were a new, unanticipated, giant shock to the economy, as in April and May 2020."

The pandemic will still be raging around the world, as the world's population gradually gets vaccinated. The Delta variant is likely to cause as much of a wave in the US this fall and winter as ancestral strains did last fall and winter, because of the combined effects of a large unvaccinated population and the increased infectivity of this strain. New, even more infectious variants could always come up, too. But will states or regions impose restrictions, given that anyone who wants a vaccine can get one? They may still need to, to prevent healthcare systems from collapsing. In summary, I'm not sure the pandemic's economic dislocations are over in the US, and I'm sure they're not over in the world as a whole. If the world gets Covid under control by a year from now, or if the economy adjusts, then prices could fall. But I'm betting that we won't quite be there by next June. Nonetheless, I think we will have seen the worst of inflation due to the pandemic before then, so I think lower rates are likely, as the economy edges back closer to long‐term trends."
