Wording doesn’t imply that large estimate changes will be made in subsequent release. A quote in the paper “To date, Congress has never allowed the HI trust fund to become depleted.” - With this being known + Medicare expansion is on the White House agenda. There should be time for the next report to continue to estimate after 2025(2026) if legislation is passed. Might need to track hire & salary rates to see any increases, it could provide a brighter outlook."

Life expectancy has been ratcheting down and obesity continues unabated. There is considerable overlap across these groups, of course. But the overall effect may be to slow down Medicare increases. Some minor tinkering with policy changes on both the revenue and spending sides could also contribute."
