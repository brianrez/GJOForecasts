"Between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018, will an armed group from Nigeria engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Nigeria?",2017-03-31T17:00:53Z,2017-07-01T06:59:53Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],323,654,98,237,"The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (Early Warning Project). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 30 June 2017 and will be resolved in April 2018 after EWP assesses the situation in Nigeria from April 2017 to March 2018. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilians fatalities occur in one or more campaigns. See (Early Warning Project) for examples. See (GJ Open) for GJ’s FAQ on forecasting questions like this. Confused?

Since Boko Haram showed up on the radar as a legitimate terrorist organization, it has yet to carry out the systematic killing of 1,000 or more people in one incident. The Nigerian Army and the UN are having military success against Boko Haram, as well. I predict no armed group will systematically kill 1,000 or more people in Nigeria between April 1, 2017 - March 31, 2018. Boko Haram seems to be following the ISIS abroad tactic of small scale terrorist attacks as their main means of combat. The major risk area I see is the borderlands and the presence of Boko Haram in other countries leaking into less secure regions of Nigeria."

The functions of the commission shall be to engage in conflict monitoring and mitigation activities, including organising regular joint interactive meetings in communities, designing and implementing peace advocacy programmes in the mass media, as well as carrying out peace advocacy work in schools, public places and worship centres” (http://allafrica.com/stories/201704270276.html) This will involve the Nigerian government working with international organisations and agencies involved in peace mediation in order to help the commission carry out its work.
