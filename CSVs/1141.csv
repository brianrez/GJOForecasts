I pulled SPTSX Index from Bloomberg and retrieved monthly returns since the year 2000 (which captures 2 market cycles). Here we are estimating 1 month future price, so we need a sample of monthly returns going back many years. I then used the probability distribution of 1 month returns to estimate the future distribution of the SPTSX Index. Momentum is one of the few factors that persist in the market and so I adjusted my estimates upward. Though there is a wide-spread belief there will be a recession in the next 12 months, I doubt it occurs in the next 1 month, so I revised upward."
