I personally think the argument against its constitutionality is very unconvincing. If it was legal as a tax, the idea that lowering the penalty to zero makes it more coercive and more of a command and that it's unconstitutional because it no longer raises revenue and therefore can't be considered a tax seems absurd. But court conservatives could be more open to that argument than me, though there did seem to be some skepticism in the questioning. But my main reason for dropping the likelihood is because most of the questions focused on standing and much less on the other issues. So I think there's a good chance the other questions aren't reached because the court rules the plaintiffs don't have standing."

The circuit court latches on to one line in Roberts' opinion: ""This process yields the essential feature of any tax: it produces at least some revenue for the Government."" Using that line they argue that a penalty of $0 no longer satisfies that component and therefore it's no longer a tax and is unconstitutional."

However, it most certainly changes the ability of the system to sustain itself financially and provide healthcare for millions without access to it. Doing away with the Individual mandate to purchase basic healthcare has skyrocketed monthly and out of pocket care costs for those who could afford to purchase it prior to the penalty amount changing to zero. (I can cite multiple examples of people paying $500 monthly for ACA marketplace plans before penalty of $0 whose monthly payments jumped to $1500 after penalty changed to $0 and then had to give up needed healthcare). This is not to discount the argument that people are being forced to sign up for services that they don’t want or need. However, I have seen firsthand dozens of individuals who were unhappy to have to purchase insurance only to be pleased with the overall outcome (being able to get a basic physical, labs, and health screenings w/o insurmountable fees and then having access to quality care near home for chronic conditions - in those who could not afford to adequately address health concerns before). During a worldwide pandemic, the multiple problems with our healthcare system have been well highlighted. No system is perfect, but I am currently banking on the fact that overall, no one wants to disrupt the system further at the present time when it is already highly chaotic and unorganized. And no alternative plan in place or even far along in the planning process for healthcare. But there remains a chance given the ages of some current sitting Supreme Court Justices and the possibility of another strict conservative justice being appointed before a decision is made. (Hang in there RBG!!!)"

53391,2020-09-08T19:17:36Z,1,[90.0],[90.0],"The question is the constitutionality of the individual mandate. This question arose once Congress set the penalty to $0 in 2017. Recall that in NFIB vs Sebillus scotus said the mandate was a tax b/c it raised revenue, and it was not coercive b/c it was a small amount (said the CJ with a six figured salary and a really big house). So if the mandate-tax is now not revenue producing is it still a tax? Maybe it is an ineffective attempt at coercion but still a coercive (and corrosive) attempt to force a consumer to enter a market which is unconstitutional. It is red meat to the conservative justices. They can declare the mandate is no longer a tax and stand on principle and effect nothing. I do not think stare decisis will stay the hand of the conservative justices."
