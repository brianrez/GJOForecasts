Cook rates this district as D+1. There is some variance both in the polls and in the expert opinions. 538 sees this one 77-23 for Williams (R) over Conole (D). Cook, Inside Elections, and Sabato all see this as a toss-up. Averaging these out seems to give Williams a 55%-60% chance of winning, but I'm inclined to go higher. The House GOP's super PAC, the Congressional Leadership Fund, didn't have much love for Williams early on, but now they've committed to ads worth twice Williams' current campaign bankroll. Given that Williams slightly ahead before their support, I see this as a final push over the finish line. 65-35, Williams."
