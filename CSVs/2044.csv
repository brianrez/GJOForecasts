However, Russia will still be active in Syria for the time being no matter what, and will not be tailoring its actions to accommodate western preferences and interests in any case. So the nose-thumbing to Russia is still relevant. Since the Turkish shoot-down NATO solidarity is also a consideration.

From what I infer, opinion among the NATO countries is split, with some calling for the invitation to show Russia that NATO isn't intimidated, and others considering an invitation to be provocative. I think it can go either way, and that the talk about Montenegro not having made adequate progress is a way of providing an excuse if the invitation does not materialize. That is, if NATO decides to make a point by voting for the invitation, Montenegro's lack of progress will be ignored, if it decides not to invite, the lack of progress will be cited as the reason. I think the whole matter has much more to do with the internal politics of NATO sending a message than it actually has to do with Montenegro's institutional progress or the wishes of its population."

That is, the west could signal that its committed to NATO expansion by inviting a tiny country non-contiguous to Russia, that Putin is unable to threaten, even he it had the inclination to do so.

Attached link indicates the Montenegrin parliament pased a resolution (only symbolic) approving NATO membership. Given that public polling indicates the general population is against current NATO membership, it seems unlikely that the Parliaments intitiative will carry much weight with NATO. Opposition parties are calling for a referendum on the topic. Parliaments choice of action seems to indicate the result of a referendum may not be positive. An invitation to join by NATO, and an acceptance by Parliament could lead to a change in government and a reversal of the decision. Suspect that not enough has been done to pass the Biden test. https://www.rt.com/news/315985-montenegro-resolution-nato-membership/"
