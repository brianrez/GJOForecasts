However, Russia will still be active in Syria for the time being no matter what, and will not be tailoring its actions to accommodate western preferences and interests in any case. So the nose-thumbing to Russia is still relevant. Since the Turkish shoot-down NATO solidarity is also a consideration.

The US has signaled its support for the accession of the former Yugoslav republic, and Montenegrin Foreign Minister Igor Lukšić said he believes the conditions exist for NATO's 28 members to decide, perhaps as soon as December, to invite Montenegro to join. “The government is determined to do everything that is needed in order to receive an invitation for NATO by the end 2015,” the Prime Minister, Milo Djukanovic, said in November. Some analysts claimed that weaknesses in the intelligence agency were a key reason for Montenegro not receiving an invitation to join NATO at its summit in Wales in September 2014. The Sudden resignation of the chief of the intelligence service, Boro Vucinic, in December 2014, came as a surprise. The exact reasons for his withdrawal were not known even by some of the highest state officials. In a brief statement forwarded by the media, Vucinic explained that he submitted his resignation after discussion and agreement with the Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic. One Brussels-based diplomat said Montenegro's accession would send a message to Moscow that it ""cannot halt NATO's expansion."""

From what I infer, opinion among the NATO countries is split, with some calling for the invitation to show Russia that NATO isn't intimidated, and others considering an invitation to be provocative. I think it can go either way, and that the talk about Montenegro not having made adequate progress is a way of providing an excuse if the invitation does not materialize. That is, if NATO decides to make a point by voting for the invitation, Montenegro's lack of progress will be ignored, if it decides not to invite, the lack of progress will be cited as the reason. I think the whole matter has much more to do with the internal politics of NATO sending a message than it actually has to do with Montenegro's institutional progress or the wishes of its population."

Some of that could have to do with concerns about the risks of “elephantiasis,” or “too biggism” – indeed, it can be argued that NATO is already several countries “too large” in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and what little some of the members bring to the core alliance tasks. But more likely it is concern that taking in any new country right now would complicate efforts to deal with Mr. Putin’s activities, the need to shore up alliance solidarity, and the hope for a way out of the current crisis that can offer at least some promise of returning to President George H.W. Bush’s vision of a “Europe whole and free” and at peace. In this view, Montenegro’s appeal to join NATO is at least ill-timed if not also unwelcome. (The United States might have a different view and will support Montenegro’s accession to NATO. The decision has to be unanimous, however, and, at the moment, U.S. interest in Europe is not taken for granted by many of the allies and thus its influence on this matter is less than it would have been at any other time in the past.

Opposition parties are calling for a referendum on the topic. Parliaments choice of action seems to indicate the result of a referendum may not be positive. An invitation to join by NATO, and an acceptance by Parliament could lead to a change in government and a reversal of the decision.
