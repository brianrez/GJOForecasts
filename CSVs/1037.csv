Barring an asteroid striking Brussels, MEPs will pass the deal, and Britain will formally leave on Friday. But all that means is that Europe’s attention can turn to the next stage: deciding Britain’s future relationship with the bloc. The European Commission has spent the past week outlining its negotiating positions on topics from fish to financial services. The end-of-year deadline for negotiations is impossibly tight, yet the British government has repeatedly ruled out any extension. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has already fallen back on his favourite catchphrase that the “clock is ticking”. If the topics sound familiar, that is because they are. Nearly four years after the Brexit vote there is still no clear picture of what the relationship between the EU and Britain will look like."

The ratification of the deal will probably take two to three months. In a best-case scenario, that leaves March to September – seven months – to strike an agreement. It’s an understatement to suggest this might not be long enough … The challenge Johnson is setting himself is immense. The risk of a no-deal cliff edge at the end of the year will remain a key concern. Second, many at the top of the government see diverging from EU rules as the big prize of Brexit. While legislation enshrining existing EU standards in the areas of workers’ rights and the environment is likely, it’s doubtful this government will agree to follow EU rules in the future."

As such, there would be a chance that the bill may not pass by the 31st deadline. Finally, if I understand the terminology of Article 50 correctly, revoking the invocation of Article 50 presumes that the UK would remain a member of the EU.

Since Boris Johnson’s Tories now have an 80-seat Commons majority, it should pass swiftly without significant amendment. This means Britain will formally leave the EU on January 31st, when Mr Johnson will insist Brexit is “done”. He even plans to stop using the B-word. Yet in reality Britain will move into an 11-month transition period when it remains subject to all EU rules. It must also negotiate a big free-trade deal with the bloc. Few trade experts believe this can be done in the time, but Mr Johnson rules out extending the transition. The likeliest outcome is a bare-bones deal for goods, with nothing for services (some 80% of the British economy). Even for this the EU will demand extensive regulatory alignment, which Mr Johnson rejects. The risk of a no-trade-deal Brexit at the end of 2020 is thus serious.”"

If the Conservatives win a majority (which I judge to be 55% likelihood), then leaving with a withdrawal agreement is highly likely as all Conservative candidates have pledged to vote for the deal. If the Conservatives are only the largest party (but no majority) or Labour win a majority/largest party then a further extension, i.e. no without the UK revoking, becomes most likely since the chances of a referendum increase and Labour have pledged that this would take place beyond January 31st 2020. The UK leaving on January 31st without a deal is only likely if the Brexit party puts in a strong showing - polls suggest this is not likely - or the EU decides not to grant another extension. The UK leaving before January 31st having revoked its invocation of Article 50 relies on another referendum with a remain vote having taken place before January 31st which is highly unlikely."
