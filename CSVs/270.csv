Per the CDC tracker site (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total), the current number of people vaccinated with 2 shots (or 1 for J&J) is 214 Million or close to 65% of the population. The initial vaccine shots have been available for over a year now. So, optimistically assuming that 1 year after the booster shot became available (September 2021 per FDA website) 65% of the people will be boostered, translates to 65% of 178.2M (total number of people eligible for booster per CDC tracker site) or 115.8 million people, well below the 165 million target for the question."

I'm reworking uptake relative to Omicron wave and tapering below pre-Omicron level from 2 weeks after the peak, allowing for 2nd dose pace from August/September and expecting 20% drop off. I now expect end of Jan: 86M, end Feb: 97M, end Mar: 106M... this isn't going to happen. Beyond this a new variant could still change things, but not by much unless vaccine efficacy was maintained. And from a social behaviour perspective, people will very likely be losing interest in taking any vaccines at all by May if they haven't already had them. Still keeping options open as recent Omicron-related questions have been unpredictable... I should allow a little more for any new booster mandating to come in, as they may well do during February, but I’m not convinced this will impact the outcome."

Finally, I aggregated with selected peers to arrive at the rough numbers above. So far the booster dosing appears to be slowing down. If there is a mandate to do this to be employed (etc), then I could see acceleration of the current pattern but if not, I think the effort may lose steam. Hopefully I'm wrong. I see that some other respected colleagues (@belikewater, @jleibowich, and @cdob63) also participating so I will be interested to see if they have a different view of things."

Also, once the Omicron/winter wave has passed, a lot of the urgency people feel now will not be felt to the same extent. In the past week, 3.771M people received their booster shot.

At there current pace of injections they will not be complete until April but the pace is likely to increase as more people become eligible and people may be holding off for the Christmas holidays.
