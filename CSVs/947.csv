There are pockets of dry area's and no doubt some Covid lockdowns in places will slow down planting temporarily but it is not universal. Last years crop was down so many farmers will be hoping for higher yields in 2020. The corn that was left over from 2019 is reportably sub standard so I would assume removed by now in order for new crops. As many forecasters point out the planted % long term average is typically 90%+ by May 31. There are no price or weather indicators that seem to be making farmers hesitate from planting at present. I did not look at the weather situation for all 18 states individually so a general comment. There was a valid comment in relation to less ethanol demand but I could not find any anecdotal comments that it was making farmers pause planting."
