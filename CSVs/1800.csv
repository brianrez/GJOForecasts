If most European countries get the warning labels roll out, then that would make it widespread. Maybe the US government has a different attitude to what Fake News is (I believe that has to be decided personally by the US President at the moment, but maybe that will change), but even if Facebook does not introduce fake news labels in the US and China and Russia and North Korea, there are enough countries in Europe to count as widespread."

In October, Mr. Maas suggested the company could be held criminally liable for users’ illegal hate speech postings if it does not swiftly remove them. https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/technology/facebook-germany-hate-speech-fake-news.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 ______________________ COMMENT: Zuckerberg rightfully so denies that US election could be affected by the fake news, but whether or not, the story is out there now, I believe that FB needs to act seriously, in Germany and all EU first as the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) (formally the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms) is an international treaty to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in Europe, will side with Germany. In Germany, Volksverhetzung (""incitement of popular hatred"") is a punishable offense under Section 130 of the Strafgesetzbuch (Germany's criminal code) and can lead to up to five years imprisonment. Section 130 makes it a crime to publicly incite hatred against parts of the population or to call for violent or arbitrary measures against them or to insult, maliciously slur or defame them in a manner violating their (constitutionally protected) human dignity. Thus for instance it is illegal to publicly call certain ethnic groups ""maggots"" or ""freeloaders"". Volksverhetzung is punishable in Germany even if committed abroad and even if committed by non-German citizens, if only the incitement of hatred takes effect within German territory, e.g., the seditious sentiment was expressed in German writing or speech and made accessible in Germany (German criminal code's Principle of Ubiquity, Section 9 §1 Alt. 3 and 4 of the Strafgesetzbuch)."
5386,2017-01-17T14:57:21Z,5,[99.0],[0.0],"I think that this question will be decided in Europe, where legislation against hate speech and lies ('fake news' in newspeak) makes Facebook (and other platforms) responsible for allowing such content. Fines of up to 500k per case are possible and German authorities have opened an investigation against Mark Zuckerberg personally for aiding & abetting hate speech.* Also, hate speech i.e. 'Volksverhetzung' is very unpopular in Europe. By allowing such content, Facebook & Co. would risk damaging their brands."

If Facebook tried to water their current ideas down too much they would likely run into political flak. Some countries may be more tolerant of fake news than others, but now that Facebook has come up with something that sounds like a workable compromise, they will not be able to go backward. It would be difficult (and probably unworkable) if Facebook did little or nothing about fake news in some countries, but took the action that it will need to take to avoid big fines in others. (I am sure the EU would be willing to pass the laws to send a multi-billion dollar bill to Facebook if they don't take appropriate action, and with the EU Parliament, the EU Commission, France, Germany and Italy all on the bandwagon, and with the need to have a cause that the whole EU can agree on, Facebook will need to deliver). NB. Governments will decide who is responsible for fake news as they decide who is responsible for lots of other things that are deemed harmful. I fully agree that marking the news items as probably untrue will not put a lot of people of reading them, but I think it is smart thinking for Facebook to get other organizations to do the fact checking to avoid the claim that Facebook is censoring what its users can read. I think the fake news debate will run and run and will merge into the libel laws. They will need to learn from the newspapers how to keep to the literal truth, while appearing to be suggestion something else.

Today the company’s flagship social network claims 1.8bn active monthly users. Facebook has attracted these hordes by engineering features that are highly addictive and relevant to their lives, so people keep coming back for more hits. Throw in the other apps it owns, such as WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger, and Facebook accounts for 30% of Americans’ mobile browsing time, compared with 11% for Google and YouTube combined. Collecting data on users has helped Facebook become the world’s second-largest advertising company on mobile devices. But Mark Zuckerberg wants to turn it into an even bigger part of the mobile ecosystem—hence the plans to develop Messenger and other messaging services into portals through which people can order taxis, communicate with businesses and so on. Being as useful as it is addictive could win Facebook even more friends Source: The Economist Espresso __________________________________ COMMENTS: If Mark Zuckerberg wants to keep his addictive FB platform still relevant and move it forward to new heights he needs to do something about it.
