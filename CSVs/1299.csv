If the WH backs off and the country gets a reprieve from the trade war, it's less likely that the Dems would benefit from the issue."

As we get closer to the election the final result will be determined by which party can mobilize the highest number of the party voters. The outside chance that the mobilization will be mainly Democrats is the reason to recognize the possibility of losses over 15 seats. I actually believe that both parties will do a good job of mobilizing their votes to the extent that they will be offsetting with less turnover of seats than generally predicted.
