On top of that, prospects of increasing demand for cooling as the weather turns hotter in the United States should drive prices higher and limit last week's inventory buildup. Meanwhile, analyst surveys point to an 87 bcf increase in stockpiles, less than the 5-year average build of 97 bcf, due to higher cooling demand in several parts of the US."""

Nonetheless, since 2011, when oi prices are above 80 the average number of rigs has been 467, and this is clos to the level seen in 2019 before the pandemic. (At oil prices below 80 the rig count is c317 - close to the current count of 317). It does take some time for new rigs to be ordered and available etc..but an increase seems likely and is consistent with an operator forecast (link below). This far out it seems hard to commit to a narrow range or single bucket and I have weighted toward the upper end of the operator forecast consistent with the historic averages at higher oil prices."
