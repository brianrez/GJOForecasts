In the history of supreme court rulings, it has overruled ~300 of its own (~25,000) [6] rulings making it a 0.5% base rate chance of the supreme court overturning Roe V wade. The % of cases overturned after 50 years (which roe v wade will be in 2023) is approximately 2.5% but those 40-49yrs averages 7%. This means I would increase the base rate to account for its current longevity to 3% accounting for the fact that it is just into the 50yr base category. In the past 30yrs 15 justices of all political backgrounds have supported abortion up to the point of fetal viability, only four had objected [14]. This makes 1 in 5 and with a majority of 5 needed this makes a 1 in 25 chance = 4%. This is roughly in line with my base rate but given the conservative leaning majority 3 of whom were elected by trump, renowned for his anti-abortion rhetoric and being the first president to attend an anti-abortion rally, I will retain my 3% base rate."

The justices will quite reasonably believe that returning the issue to the democratic process will not destroy the court's reputation like defenders of Roe would like them to believe"

Especially considering that other members of the court may not agree that viability was defined in Casey, they may think the origin of the viability standard came from Roe.
