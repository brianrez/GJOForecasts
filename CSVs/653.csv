I wish him well and a good health, but - if I got it right - the Palestinian territories have reported more than 80,000 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases so far, at a total population of 4mn or less. This means that 4 to 5% of Palestinians have been infected already, considering those unreported infections that may remain unreported due to strains in the local health supply, the percentage may well be much higher, at 10 to 30% easily. Before the Palestinian territories will have vaccination available, they may be one of the regions of the world where herd immunity comes into play first. All that said, this increases the likelihood of politicians in general to get infected (as this is a highly ""social"" job where complete physical distancing is almost impossible), and given his age Mahmud Abbas has an increased risk of passing, if infected. One in three, for the time being."
