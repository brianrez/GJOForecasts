This is particularly notable compared to the 1 month prior when everyone was out and about. I feel that in a few weeks time, the number of states above Rt1 will remain fairly consistent. I add more consideration to less than 36 as multiple states have been hovering just above Rt1 and could easily swing in a small positive direction. I put additional weight (albeit very small) in the less than 30 bin - as the recent push by WH to wear a mask and take seriously may, possibly, have some effect at furthering precautions taken by the public. This could push the number of states under Rt1 significantly downward (see 2 mos ago for comparison). I feel it is more likely that the number of states with Rt >/= 1 will increase to above 43 over decreasing to under 30. Overall, I still predict it will remain fairly stable - say between 35-40."

All of this is likely to push the rate of new infections to grow.

This could happen before or after the end of August and could happen repeatedly, as it already has.

The R naught is not something that is widely tracked (compared to new cases or deaths in absolute numbers). But given the existing state of 38 states higher than 1, layered against (i) rising case numbers nationally and rising hospitalizations says the virus is still spreading, (ii) despite the rising case numbers, states are trending towards reopening. Pause orders are not effective because it simply maintains the status quo- which in a rising COVID environment, does nothing to reduce the R naught, absent any additional countermeasures and (iii) mask orders are not yet widely in place with states with the biggest spread. If we are not staying home, increased mask use is the only thing we can layer on to effectively bring the R naught down. There is good science behind it (I'm not debating whether the mask protects the user or the people around them- it is simply true that there is a strong correlation between increased mask use and reduction of any infectious spread). Even a mandate at this point may not work given the politization of use. Now back to the buckets. 24 of fewer is a zero possibility. In 6 weeks it is impossible to imagine 14 states with R naughts above 1 to bring down the spread. More infections are happening today which means numbers for the next 3-4 weeks will only go up. Immediate action will only bring the numbers down in 4-6 weeks. And that depends on widespread adoption (of masks) because there are no other countermeasures available. Then I just looked at the remaining buckets to rank them among each other. Given the trends, I think it's likely that more states will experience increased spread. But that the same time, states are trying to limit spread as much as possible so, hopefully it won't be rampant. So I placed the greatest weight to 2 buckets- making sure to allocate more than 50% because that is what I think is the likely scenario. Then I just allocated between the two, again on a relative basis. I think it is more likely that with the summer and the continued to desire to re-open until it becomes painfully obvious that we cant, that the number of states with an increased R naught will grow. Lastly, weighing the trend today against the remaining 2 buckets, I allocated the remainder on a relative basis."

Into the mix many schools opening Aug 21 and later in August. Have to wonder if the rt is based on contact tracing. In some places they say with the numbers being infected it is impossible to do and they also do not have enough people/resources to do this. What a mess. Upshot: maybe school reopening will not show-up much by Aug. 31. Off the top it seems like 4-10 states are often getting worse, maybe that many going down in numbers and the rest in a steady but not good status. That guess puts it in the 30s realm.
