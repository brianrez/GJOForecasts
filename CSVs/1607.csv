Although the political climate is ripe for violence between the two groups, the threshold of 125 casualties has been unmet since October of last year.

ICG restricts the domain of actors to those killed and confirmed fatalities. It excludes cases from its count that are unconfirmed. This further restricts the domain of the two actors in conflict interactions: the Turkish state, its officers, police and other officials along with PKK insurgents and its proxies. Turkey views the PKK as a terror group, while the PKK is engaged in a political and military struggle for independence. Since the cessation of a relatively short period of conflict and an unsuccessful coup against the state, the two sets of actors have intensified their asymmetric non-zero-sum game of terror and counterterror. Given this dynamic we should expect the counts to move above the threshold, however, restrictions on the range for counts in 4 groups will be reduced. Depending on the military tactics employed by the PKK, and the constrained definitions in counting methods, this should reduce the total number of casualties counted by ICG. Additional data sources would indicate support for crossing the threshold but the constraint explanation reasonably accounts for variances in actual versus the constrained casualties counted."
