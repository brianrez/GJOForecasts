If anything, I think that Trump not tweeting when Haley announced lends credence to the idea that if he is going to come back to Twitter he will do so in a planned way at a planned time. Given that it's February (when no major political news tends to happen for presidential candidates their other then the incumbent) I don't think it makes sense for that planned time to be before the 26th. Additionally, given that there hasn't been any news about Trump finding away around his contract with Truth Social I'm not sure there is a way Trump could legal tweet. He might have been willing to violate his contract usually but the on going government investigations surrounding him make me think he is unlikely to want to add a contract violation case to his legal issues."

As we continue to face crises at home and abroad, that the former President certainly has his opinions on, his Twitter account remains inactive. This fact, coupled with his financial obligation to Truth Social, support the notion that he will NOT Tweet by 26 February 2023. We're also in the beginning stages of investigating data that suggests Trump favorability decreasing in correlation with how often he Tweeted, yet another reason in support of his aversion to Twitter now."

109276,2023-02-10T21:46:55Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"Because Donald Trump is contractually obligated to post exclusively on his own social media platform, Truth Social, it is highly unlikely that he will post on Twitter before 26 February 2023. Inside sources indicate that Trump is actively banned from posting on any media outlets or social media platforms besides Truth Social until July of 2023. Another important aspect to consider is Trump's announcement for his campaign in the 2024 presidential elections. This would typically indicate a reason for activity and promotion on as many social media platforms as possible, and the more time that progresses since his initial announcement, the less likely he is to begin posting on Twitter again."

Since Elon became the owner of twitter, he has reinstaed a number of contoversial accounts on the platoform such as Andrew Tate. However, he also recnetly revoked Kanye West's account after posting an antisemtic symbol over the star of David. If Musk had not revoked West's account, I would have said Trump's likelyhood of tweeting would be much closer to 100%, but now that there is evidence that Musk will subscribe to censorship on the basis that a person crosses an undetermined line, I believe Trump will wait. I also believe there is a high chance Trump will wait to post for the formal annoucment of when his social media site, Truth Social, will be avalible to the public."

109325,2023-02-10T04:17:15Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"For starters, the most likely reason is the contract that Trump signed that requires him to first post any form of social media post to Truth Social, and then is only allowed to post 6 hours after on any other platform. This is compounded by the fact that he has a financial interest of corralling his followers on the platform, as well as a strained relationship with Twitter. Even though Twitter was bought by Elon Musk, Trump and Musk have had a relatively public strained relationship recently, with Trump not seeming interested in returning to Twitter despite his reinstated account."

So, I'll keep his initial chances of posting at 5%. But he has 88 Mn followers on Twitter and 4 Mn on Truth Social. Staying with Truth Social sounds like a bad deal. Every passing day, Trump must be feeling a small nudge away from Truth Social towards Twitter. Let the nudge be small like 1% of his original likelihood. Over time, it compounds. So, we'll apply compound interest formula to literally calculate how his interest compounds over 88 days. 5% (initial likelihood) * (1 + .01) ^ 88 ~ 13% chance. (If you've survived this, congrats)I know the math is ludicrous. Based absolutely on no evidence. Still it's a model. I won't take the figures but I feel it's pointing towards right direction. I'll lessen the chances of him tweeting by a bit."

The simple Truth (see what I did there?) is that on twitter Trump currently has some 87 million followers, however on Truth Social he has 4.57 million (https://www.reuters.com/technology/musks-twitter-poll-showing-narrow-majority-want-trump-reinstated-2022-11-20/), so its a simple numbers game.

The biggest 'risk' of this happening will be after key events relating to Trump (and maybe Twitter!). They are generally unpredictable of course, but the time period that Trump is likely to have more media coverage is probably in the next month (as he is investigated over tax affairs and before the Republicans take control of the House in January) and then in the presidential primaries (out of scope for this question)."
