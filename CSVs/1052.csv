I tried to think about using historical data, but from looking at the National Book Awards website, the judges seem to change every year, which makes it a little harder to believe that past information is predictive of future outcomes. [1] In addition, some have written about how the awards are not a reward for success, which makes it hard to believe that using sales data or book review information is predictive of award outcomes. [2] I looked at a list of winners, and though I think I'm pretty well read, but I don't really recognize many of the more recent winners (post 2000). [3] This is suggestive that this is really not a popularity contest."
