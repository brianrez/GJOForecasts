At the moment, the crowd here is estimating roughly 3-2 odds in favor of Warnock (D). Prediction markets are estimating pretty much the same odds in the opposite direction, favoring Walker (R). The forecasters are all at 50-50, and unlike some of the other close races, 538 is right there with them. It's interesting to see the diversion here, and I have to wonder if personal partisan bias is responsible for the way that different crowd sourcing communities are essentially in arbitrage on a race that isn't exactly wanting for information or analysis. I don't know what to do with this one, so I just averaged it all out. 52-48, Walker. I'd be surprised if that didn't change."

A few of these voters will not want to vote for Walker, due to Walker's scandals. Of those voters, a certain percentage will vote for Warnock, who is running as a moderate. But a certain percentage will vote for the Libertarian candidate. If this is enough to deny Warnock 50% of the vote, this will go into runoff.
