It took less that a day for vocal skepticism and doubters to trigger a retraction by the magazine, although a clear retraction from Andresen was less forthcoming. If this alleged Satoshi, the Australian Craig Wright, wanted to silence doubters, the true Satoshi certainly could by transacting with the large bucket of coins known to date back to earliest days as would be visible in the public ledger. However White has declined to offer any further proof, leaving watchers to speculate as to his true intentions or voracity of his claims."

Seems the most accurate one is to look at transactions minus long chain ones (as those could have manipulations). The rate at which the transactions are increasing are also not strictly linear. It is flitting significantly with a delta of around 50k txns over three consecutive days. However, it seems, it stays high for two out of three days. The average, best I could locate currently, is nearly 230k at this point. So 250k seems to be a very tricky number. I think this volatility will stay unless something changes dramatically and I don't see that happening anytime soon. So I bet 250k exceeding is a tough one, say around 1 in 5 odds. Rest to the middle bracket, with a small bit to under 125k (most unlikely)."

However, occurancies of extremes was more frequent in 2015 and is event more in 2016. There have been multiple spikes, whichs background needs to be examined (even weeks with slump under 125k, but none within last 40 weeks).

Then we have another group that thinks of bitcoin as more of a settlement network (Bitcoin Core), and that end users should use sidechains, the Lightning network or other future initiatives that could appear in the future as networks for payment. So, we have on one hand a thesis for a bitcoin blockchain that would handle more transactions with low fees following a network hard fork, and on the other, a thesis for a bitcoin blockchain that can handle fewer transactions but higher amounts (and as a consequence higher fees).

The reason this question has a break at 250k per day is that there's a problem with bitcoin's ability to handle volumes in excess of about 250k. There's been a couple of proposals about how to fix this problem, but bitcoin users seem unable to agree on which fix to adopt. A few days ago, volume peaked at over 260k but so did reports of delays of up to 40 min in processing transactions. Now volumes are WAY down, in the 180k range. They need to get their act together ASAP or bitcoin will be history. Until I read reports of an agreement to a fix (called a ""hard fork"", I think), I'm reducing my forecast for 250k to 50%."

Such delays just don't work for ""retail"" consumer transactions. Look at this graph: https://blockchain.info/charts/my-wallet-n-tx ""MyWallet"" transactions have fallen from 112K to 49K in the matter of a few days.

It's this very clampdown on personal financial rights that has driven citizens to use bitcoin, because it's essentially untraceable and anonymous. The technology was invented for this very purpose. Asia based exchanges have seen growth of 280% to 847% in just one year! -In the west, BitStamp has more than doubled from October 2014 to October 2015. -Retail and service purchases in BTC are also on the rise, suggesting that people use it as a day to day currency. -BTC now accounts for $289 million in daily transactions, not that far behind PayPal's $397 million. -A large portion of $469 million of venture capital already invested this year will be used to make it more user-friendly for non techies. - BitPay allows merchants to accept BTC payments with no more hassle than a credit card, at just 1% of the transaction, which is less than credit cards. -BTC can also be automatically converted in to a traditional currency. -100,000 merchants are now taking BTC payments, which is up from last year's 65,000. -Mega corporations like Expedia and Microsoft are on board. -Retail stores, bars, cafes and restaurants are allowing payment in BTC through mobile apps."

This obviously assumes that there are no significant regulatory changes, movements to other currencies, etc. The daily transaction ranges are quite volatile, in about 2 weeks in June 2015 ranging about 80,000 transactions. So, I would estimate 170,000 transactions per day, with a very wide confidence interval. However, even adding such a wide swing of 80,000 to 170,000 just hits 250,000, so I think it is very likely that the range will be less than 250,000 per day. 125,000 is still within the confidence interval, though.

Furthermore, this estimate isn't really limited by the total number of possible bitcoin transactions per day (which is ~500,000 at a very conservative estimate). An extrapolated exponential regression of 28-day trailing median - utilized to smooth the curve - projects just over 200,000 bitcoin transactions in June. Furthermore, the next bitcoin halving is expected to occur sometime in June which will presumably lead to increased attention / publicity. Trading volume increased dramatically prior to Litecoin halving in August 2015. It is probable that trading will reside in the 125K - 250K realm, but possible that excitement will drastically increase volumes."

A temporary spike of 21.7% above this expected value would be required to exceed 250k. Excluding the December 2015 spike (which I think can be attributed directly to holiday gift-giving), there have been 14 days out of the last 530 (the period which my curve fits best) that exceeded this threshold. This suggests a 2.5% chance to exceed 250k on 6/7. My confidence is weakened by the impending reduction in the block reward, expected in August. It seems plausible that speculative trading in the lead-up to that event could cause a surge in volume, but I have no idea how large such an effect might be. If it caused a 10% increase in volume, then an 11.7% spike in the normal volume would be enough to hit 250k, and 8% of the last 530 days exhibit such a spike. I have no idea how reasonable an estimate 10% is for the effect of a possible speculation boom a month before an anticipated event. It feels a little extreme to me, but I'm not confident in that assessment, so I'll go with that 8% for 250+. On second thought, there was a smaller spike during the first week of June 2015, so I'll bump it up to 9% on the chance that that spike was due in part to some annually repeating event."

DISCLAIMER - MERS has brought me to the dark side and I could be called a Tea Party Economist. In a nutshell - the Triffen Delima is a result of abandoning the Gold System in '71-'72 and it is part of how Bretton Woods stayed in force. (It should have collapsed with out gold backing) and exists because now we have the world putting its faith in OUR WORD not our gold. According to the printing on physical bills - we in turn - place our faith in God. Yeah I know. Anyway - some links for you - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKOTQCpJGUs - this one picks on China in Particular. By ""agreeing"" to have its currency used as a reserve currency, a country pins its hands behind its back. In order to keep the global economy chugging along, it may have to inject large amounts of currency into circulation, driving up inflation at home. The more popular the reserve currency is relative to other currencies, the higher its exchange rate and the less competitive domestic exporting industries become. This causes a trade deficit for the currency-issuing country, but makes the world happy. If the reserve currency country instead decides to focus on domestic monetary policy by not issuing more currency then the world is unhappy. Becoming a reserve currency presents countries with a paradox. They want the ""interest-free"" loan generated by selling currency to foreign governments, and the ability to raise capital quickly, because of high demand for reserve currency-denominated bonds. At the same time they want to be able to use capital and monetary policy to ensure that domestic industries are competitive in the world market, and to make sure that the domestic economy is healthy and not running large trade deficits. Unfortunately, both of these ideas – cheap sources of capital and positive trade balances – can't really happen at the same time."
