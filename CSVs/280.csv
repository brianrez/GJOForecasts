I'd estimated up to 38k on 5th September including a tranche of Teslas (their Model 3 added approx 6.9k on it's own) which are bulk registered on entry to the UK. September is historically the most active month with a new plate, hence the higher figures than previous few months. Also of note is the market share for September at 16.9%, and YtD 14.5%, which confirms to me that the annual share should be no more than 15.5% given there is 1Qt to go, Tesla increased the share for September, other macro factors are only changing slowly (other than inflationary), and pent-up demand should lessen any reduction in sales caused by inflation and other rising costs of living. Overall volume was up 4.6%, but YtD down 8.2%. On that basis I'd expect total volume circa 91-94% of 2021 and ~15.5% market share = 225-240k. Combining this view with an anticipated volume of 40-60K for the final Qt using a forecast trend in comparison with last year, I get a total 215-235k, and a consensus at around 225-235k. Forecast unchanged."

But at 27.5% and 15% growth respectively there is clearly a lot of volatility based on continuing issues with supply-chains and chip shortages, while the BEV share increased to 17.7% of market. Overall demand should stay strong relative to production, so I am still in line with original forecast with overall sales up on 2021 and BEV increasing market share. The harder part is how much ground will the BEV market take this year and whether global tensions will impact sales. Approx 15-20% growth overall still looks very achievable, and the BEV market share looks fairly locked in at 13-14%, with potential up to perhaps 18% due to buyers 'future proofing' after a long wait, along with manufacturers prioritising BEVs (partly due top margins and industry shift) and steady shift in marketing and media attention towards sustainability, climate issues etc. So as a base level: 1.647M vehicles last year * 1.15/1.20 = 1.894/1.976M total BEV share 14-18% gives a low range of 265-340k and a more likely upper range of 276-355k so far."

Given this data I think a suitable modelling approach would be: - Estimate the total number of car registrations in 2022 - Estimate the % of car registrations that are AFV (alternative fuel vehicles) - Estimate the % of AFV vehicles that are BEV (battery electric vehicles) -- this assumes that people choosing alternative fuel vehicles choose between the range of options."

For example two plausible scenarios 1.8 new reg and 25% BEV = 450. A stronger recovery back to 2.3 but a lower BEV share of 15% = 345.
