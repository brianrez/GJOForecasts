This seems to be having the effect of flattening the usual pattern we have always seen, of much higher travel numbers on Th, F, Su, Mon and much lower numbers on Tu, Sa, and to a lesser extent Wed. Tu, Wed and Sa numbers are increasing, while Th, F, Su and Mon numbers seem to have maxed out. I think this might make it much more likely that a Wed-Fri grouping could happen in bin 4. The high days of the week are now regularly over 2.3M, so we just need to pull up another day. In 2019, the biggest travel days in bin 4 were after the 4th of July weekend, so I think the most likely dates for this question to resolve to yes are the Tu 7/5-Th 7/7 or Wed 7/6-Fri 7/8 groupings after the holiday. Other Wed-Fri groupings in July are also possible.@CJH"

This data showed that June and July are the busiest months historically which helped to guide my early thinking. I then ran a monte carlo simulation using Python and the last 3 months worth of 2022 numbers as a percentage of 2019. I then made the assumption that the 2019 to 2022 ratio is likely to be in line with the last 3 months if not increase as trips booked at the start of the year when the covid situation was less certain begin to kick in. This simulation suggested a 65% probability that the TSA will record 3 consecutive days of 2.3 or more before the 30th of July. It's also worth noting that fathers day falls on the last weekend of June in the US which will likely result in a short lived boost to numbers which have hit 2.3 on 2 consecutive days a number of times recently. Economic difficulties, continued anxiety around covid and possibly even recent gun violence in the US could work against my forecast, pushing the date of 2.3m in 3 consecutive days back into July or later. I also think there's an argument that we won't see this happen until July as major countries that fly to US airports (US, Canada, Mexico and the UK) have school summer holidays."

In 2019, July 4 was on a Thursday, so people made a long weekend out of it, and flights were high from Sunday, July 7 through Friday, July 11 (corresponding to July 4-8, 2021 in the TSA data). This year, July 4 is on a Monday, so when will people be flying? I'm going to guess that flights will be high July 5-8 this year. So if the question doesn't resolve in June, I think it might just resolve in the days after July 4. I think it will mostly depend on how much airlines can bring up capacity."

If we assume a normalization of travel numbers in 2021 (which is a tough assumption given the new Omnicron variant), there is a 2% probability that you'd get a 3 days in a row with 2.3M.
