The most sensitive period of time for fail is around April, when the water levels in the reservoir behind the dam are highest and put the greatest amount of pressure on the structure. However, this time period has already passed for this year."

From my recollection of that earlier story it appears the situation now is as expected then i.e. the problems were well known the Italian engineers are at work, the US army is monitoring the dam, its badly located, the risk is highest in the Spring. My view is that with Mosul being a place that is the news for other reasons and the risk of the dam failing being so well known, then the risk of it failing in 2017 is lower that in was in 2014, 2015 and 2016 (when obviously it did not fail) many outside actors have a strong interest in ensuring the dam does not fail when the world is watching so closely. The example of the Teton dam in Idaho (see New Yorker article) does show the risk of building dams on unstable rock, but it failed within months of opening, the Mosul dam has survived for over 30 years."

The coalition against ISIS should make moves to retake Mosul after the January of 2017. Here the chance occurs that ISIS moves to cause collapse of the damn if Mosul begins to fall. The likelihood of Mosul falling is very good within the next year, but most likely not until after the US election cycle. I feel that the US election cycle, current state of Iraqi Army units, and the conflicts in Syria and Turkey are preventing a move into Mosul until early 2017 at the earliest. Should this time table move up, US supported efforts, combined with the current Italian ones, should keep the dam intact until after 2018. However, ISIS is the factor which leads me to state if it is going to collapse, it will do so next year. Will take more looks at this as the news develops."

This is a mighty effort; undertaken by a company--Trevi--that already had extensive expertise in such works in the middle east, has also the know-how to perform it. 2. Their contract is to repair the dam, but they are surely looking to have the contract to rebuild the dam once the situation stabilizes 3. They are receiving a lot of help from the US, Iraq, and the Kurds (both militarily and with engineering expertise) **This makes me think also that Mosul will soon be retaken by the Anti-ISIS forces."

The US Army Corps of Engineers has been intimately involved, as well. A semi-confidential report issued earlier this year that was partially leaked through the Iraqi Parliament, gave the findings of a very bleak Corps assessment of the dam’s condition. The findings of that report were largely responsible for sounding the alarm on urgent maintenance needs.
