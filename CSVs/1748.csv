Next to that there are the production issues with the new model. And I cannot imagine the cheaper model has less issues than the more expensive one. So, no, not before 2018, probably not even before 2019, but in 2018 it will become widely known Tesla is just not good enough technically and that is basically end of story."

Furthermore, the Tesla model of making one large bet which will capture a lot of market once it grows sufficiently is really similar to Uber. Whoever is backing Tesla has a similar mindset as the backers of Uber (take your time, burn a lot of money and get the technology up to speed, but hopefully capture an enormous market share). Also it is worth mentioning that Tesla is a strong disruptor of traditional car companies. A restructure whoever is a more possible scenario."
