368,2017-07-29T16:59:40Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"Levels of contestation between the government and the opposition is close to its optimum value; this implies that at the threshold, either repression will subdue opposition activity resulting in international condemnation, or, international pressure from the OAS, the United States and other Latin American countries will push the economic and political threshold into the realm of dictatorship, collapse or civil war. With the results of constitutional assembly election due soon, absent an opposition in the process it will hold ground through non participation and ongoing protests and riots; with resistance and rebellion intensifying its effect on economic and political in(stability) will exponentially increase the role of international agencies such as rating agencies, IMF, WB and states who trade with Venezuela; volatity will rise as people rebel. The key measure to look for is the number of resistance and opposition deaths between tomorrow and the next two weeks that follow. The inaccurate and wrongly attributed statement to Marie Antoinette during the first French Revolution, ""let them eat cake,"" could become a palpable taste (no pun intended) in the mounts of resisters and official opposition to Madura and the repressive, fascist socialist revolution of the Chavistas"

According to http://www.caraotadigital.net/nacionales/las-106-muertes-violentas-en-117-dias-de-protestas-contra-regimen-de-maduro/ the observed maximum is 14 deaths the 20th of April, but end of July is bloody: 6 deaths the 20th, 3 the 26th and 4 the 27th. As long as Maduro's side will continue with harsh (even harsher) enforcement and concentrate the power in its hands (Supreme Court bypass, threat on private property, ...) there is little chance the protests stop or even decrease their strength. But 25 is quite a high number if we look at the history of these protests, so even it's possible (~50%) it's rather a ""low"" probability => ~40-45%"

12943,2017-07-28T03:10:55Z,1,[2.0],[2.0],25 deaths is a big number. Rarely do political protests anywhere result in that many deaths. Even very major events like the Tiananmen Square in 1989 resulted in perhaps some hundreds of deaths. 25 in Venezuela in a single day in the next few weeks is not that likely.

Most despots have some understanding that civilian fatalities are bad for business, especially when you don't have the backing of a major power. Equally as unlikely is 25+ police casualties, as that would likely result in a full-scale eruption of hostilities. But as @Anneinak noted, this can happen without warning."
