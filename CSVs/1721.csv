"Between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018, will an armed group from Yemen engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Yemen?",2017-03-31T17:00:03Z,2017-07-01T06:59:03Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],146,654,64,237,"The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (Early Warning Project). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 30 June 2017 and will be resolved in April 2018 after EWP assesses the situation in Yemen from April 2017 to March 2018. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilians fatalities occur in one or more campaigns. See (Early Warning Project) for examples. See (GJ Open) for GJâ€™s FAQ on forecasting questions like this. Confused?

No single entity in Yemen (Houthis/ISIS/AQAP/UAE/SA) has made a coordinated push to significantly engage in a campaign that has killed that many civilians since the Houthis rolled (relatively unopposed) into Sana'a from their stronghold in the north. Heavy civilian casualties will not favor any entity in trying to establish their government or have it recognized by the international community.

If the port suffers damage or fighting takes place near the port, food deliveries will be disrupted - leading the thousands of deaths.

Al Qaeda has already claimed and lost and reclaimed towns in Yemen ad nauseam. Lack of an effective central government, drug addiction, a poor economy and conservative religious beliefs often leads to genocide aka systematic killings. There are examples throughout Africa and the middle east. The country that Yemen seems to parallel the most is Liberia, which had mass genocide in the near past.
