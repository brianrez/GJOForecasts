Afganistan and Pakistan, however, continue to have infected each year. Their infected rate has been (since 2011) 278, 95, 107, 334, 74 (ending 2015). Thru June 28th of 2016, there have been 18 confirmed wild cases in Afganistan and Pakistan, compared to 29 the prior year during the same time period. Although the level of infected in the neighboring region is low and the region Africa has been without infection for 22 months (Aug '14 - Jun '16), there is still risk of infection, in my opinion. I do not know of a way to quantify the risk, so I'll think in terms of 10% of risk. I think it is less than a 50% chance they get infected, probably less than 20%, but more than 10%. So i'll split the difference."

Yet, despite the very mixed political stability of African regimes, this issue does not seem to be as much of a barrier. If the continent were more stable, I'd give its chances of remaining free of polio a higher rating. However, polio has a variable incubation period (with a case report as long as 12 years!) and does not cause symptoms in the majority of people who are infected. The human infected pool could still be significant in Africa, and any of those people could, in theory, begin to display symptoms if their immune systems were to be compromised, as with HIV, for example."

Since 2014 cases of wild polio were not registered in Africa. Real and acting wild source of poliovirus are Afganistan and Pakistan, people from those countries usually travel in other continents. Also, the fight against polio continues worldwide, but odds for poliovirus in Africa is existing, as the population is large and there is good condition for an infection spread."

In 1988, the Global Polio Eradication initiative was created in response to the astonishingly high rate of polio in the world. This gained a lot of attention, and many people have been committed to the cause. Although Polio was a major problem in Africa in the 2000’s, the problem has been slowly brought under control. August 11 of 2015 marked the first time in history when there was not a single recorded case in the entire continent of Africa. This means that Africa has been polio-free for over a year and a half. Although other diseases caused by viruses may bring the attention away from polio, this is unlikely, as many organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) have stressed the importance of completely eradicating the Wild Poliovirus."

August 11, marked a year without polio, and there have only been 2 countries who have not stopped the poliovirus ever and those two countries are not in Africa. I give this an 8% chance of happening because disease can spread and ebola recently spread throughout Africa recently, however due to all the new organizations, vaccinations, and the protocols in place I give this a small chance of this happening"

I spoke with an African guy yesterday who tried to sell me a pile of cast copper bronze items from the Dogon culture. This may seem to be an irrelevant experience, but bear with me. The items were representational human figures of various types. He told me they came from Niger and Mali. You can check examples of Dogon artifacts displayed in major museums. Another source, the Saturday edition of the WSJ, tells the sad tale of what you could call the new evangelical form of Islam that is creating mahem in these countries. The small story effect is that fearful people are packing up bundles of representational sculpture and selling them for scrap because they don't want to get caught with anti-Islamic items that depict the human form. The big story effect is chaos across the mid-section of the continent. If you sweep these disparate pieces together, you come back around to the main concern for this question. War and civil disorder can mess up the great work being done by public health authorities. There are so many places in Africa where social disintegration reigns, and in many of these places media attention is sparse. There is a lot of population movement.

You mentioned your Merck manual, are you a nurse? I am a BSN-RN PHN, but a very green new grad, with absolutely no experience yet, still looking for my first job. The only thing I have to inform me on this question are the most basic 101 classes in microbiology and pathophysiology, an overview of the public health model and what I learned in those classes makes me want to keep my forecast very low, and be very pessimistic. On the other hand, I look at the wonderful progress that has been made world wide since the eradication programs started in 1988, and in Africa, I see that there has been no diagnosed WPV for 2015 and I wonder if it’s possible that they have pulled off an incredible achievement that was targeted for 2019. If not, they are sooooo close. They are approaching the finish line. I guess that’s why the powers-that-be at GJ picked this topic for a question, curse you GJ powers! (shakes fist in air). Still, at the end of it all, the final success of polio eradication in Africa depends on how well the following countries (identified as “states no longer infected by wild poliovirus, but which remain vulnerable to international spread” Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Somalia. http://www.polioeradication.org/Keycountries/PolioEmergency.aspx) have complied with the plans and recommendations given over the last couple of years, and this necessitates a knowledge of their recent history of political and social conditions, and the state of their public health programs. Also, I should think the amount of concern, and public funds dedicated to the cause by governments plays a big part. I stand by my statements previously about the precarious and tenuous state of the whole campaign at this twilight moment before polio sets like the sun on the world horizon. Any disengagement by authorities, gaps in meeting quotas, slip ups, health care personnel problems, non-conforming to the action plans could easily manifest as individual or small outbreaks of polio somewhere. The sense of concern and warning about this is very noticeable in the October Global Eradication Initiative report. So, more research digging around in google is called for, I have decided to go back up to 20% and sit there while researching how well these countries have carried out their eradication programs as best I can. I may possibly adjust depending on what I find, and I will certainly share anything interesting with you! It has been fun having these exchanges, and very helpful. I’m also going to re-visit and rummage around more in these links that have been my main sources: Wiki article with helpful chart on R0 number and HIT percentages (explained in “mechanics” section of the article ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity The good ole CDC http://www.cdc.gov/polio/ The Global Polio Eradication Initiative http://www.polioeradication.org/ WHO http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/polio/en/"

53,2015-09-04T02:31:11Z,1,[45.0],[45.0],"Famulare's article (""Has the wild poliovirus been eliminated from Nigeria?"" (July 10, 2015 revision) http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.02751v2.pdf) is interesting and supports the high probabilities others are giving for this question. One issue that I have with basing my belief too much on his analysis is that his model is unable to incorporate environmental test results. (See http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Surveillance.aspx for what those are. ) I would like to find an analysis that incorporated environmental data too since it implies (I think) circulating wild type virus which is going undetected via paralysis cases."

Somalia & Nigeria are the African countries with the most recent cases. International effort to reduce Somalia-based piracy has seen significant success, but that means that Somalis have lost an important source of income. Nigeria's president is former military so we may start seeing success against Boko Haram. But we're seeing unprecedented numbers of migrants and all it would take would be for one Pakistani to go to Somalia."

48,2015-09-02T01:33:32Z,1,[80.0],[80.0],"First impression guess here, 80. There have been 13 months polio-free, but in one out of the last 14 months (the one longest ago) there was a case of polio. The time frame is 16 months to go. 100 percent /14 months = 7 percent chance a month (high) down to a zero percent chance (low) if you'd like to believe it's eradicated, no way it could spread from elsewhere, etc. 7 percent a month leaves a 93 percent chance it hasn't happened by next month to the power of 16 months leaves a 29 percent chance of Africa being polio-free after 16 months. If I split the difference between 29 and 100 percent, since I think a seven percent chance a month is too high, I get 64.5 (remarkably similar to someone else's guess). If I split the difference between 0 percent and 7 percent, and go with (1.00-.035)^16, that works out to 54.6 percent. However, what do we know about eradication of other diseases, or any other analagous cases? If the per-month chance of it coming back is really only 2 percent, then the advance probability of continued eradication by then is ""really"" closer to 72 percent. And if you figure a 2 percent chance this month, but only a one percent change 8 months from now, and only a .5 percent chance 8 months after that (probably closer to how a good actuarial model of these events might really look), then the probability of longer-term eradication only goes up from there. Some research into past cases of disease eradication might clarify what the marginal probability each month really might be, and better frame the overall chances."

35,2015-09-02T00:04:07Z,1,[64.0],[64.0],I lean to yes on this one. The problem with going with a stronger yes is there are areas where governments do not have free movement. I doubt there are too many NGOs or other personal going into areas controlled by Boko Haram for example.
