Like Putin, Erdogan believes that countries need to be ruled, not lead. So Erdogan will not meet the EU conditions for Visa free travel. The EU has many voters who feel that the last thing that the EU needs is visa free travel from a large Muslim country, so for the EU it is convenient that Turkey has not met the visa free travel conditions (72 in total). If the EU allowed Turks visa free travel without Turkey complying it would look very weak. Turkey could scrap the refugee agreement with the EU, but besides the visa free travel clause it included money from the EU. Therefore its possible that an ""adjustment"" to the deal (e.g. more money from the EU to Turkey) will compensate for the visa free travel."
