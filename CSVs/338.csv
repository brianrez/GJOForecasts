When just looking at Democrats this amplified to losing 3.3 seats Given the current Senate composition (i.e. tied, Demo tie-breaker) any loses for the Democrats would give favour to the Republicans to take control. So my base case assumes Republicans 68% of the time Democrats were in power, they lost seats 60% of the time seats were lost generally For simplicity let's split the difference and say 64% chance that seats are lost this election and this means Republicans take control I am going to extremize this given my initial news review regarding Republican efforts to win key races (I'll come back to support this) Let's put this at 72% which is oddly right in line with the crowd"

I suspect all 3 of the ones held by Republicans will continue to be Republican given the current political environment, but there is still time for things to change and something unexpected could happen. Meanwhile, the Democrats would need to defend 3 seats to keep control. The reason I suspect the Democrats have a better chance than the crowd forecast suggests is because these senate races are not probabilistically independent. I'll try to write a bit more about this later when I have time."

Taking a close look at the top ten race, it could be close, but still strongly favors Republicans taking the Senate. - Pennsylvania (open) - Democrats my be excited about the prospect of picking up outgoing Republican Toomey's seat, but they need to remember history. Toomey initially won the seat in 2010 (Obama's first mid-term) and reelection in 2016, which followed another general historical trend from the second half of the 20th Century, after eight years of a President of one party, a President of the other party follows (notable exception, George W. H. Bush following Reagan). In comparison is former Republican Senator Rick Santroum. He was first elected in the Republican wave of 1994 (Clinton's first mid-term), re-elected in 2000 (Presidency switched parties after eight years), and lost re-election in 2006 (George W. Bush's second mid-term). If following historical trends, 2022 will be more akin to 1994 and 2010. Republican hold the seat. - Georgia (incumbent seeking re-election) - Republicans certainly have a long term problems in Georgia, but the short term remains favorable towards them, especially in a mid-term. One should not forget, it was only just over twenty years ago that both Georgia Senators were Democrats. The Governor's race will also have a certainly have an impact in the Senate race. This is probably, at least at the moment, a true toss-up with the slightest of leans towards the Republicans. - Wisconsin (incumbent, unsure if he seeking re-election) - This state has ever-so-slowly been trending Republican for about two decades, but generally rebuffed by the growth of the Madison Area. Outside of Madison and Milwaukie, the state is extreme red, which was not the case twenty years ago. The question in Wisconsin is always minority turnout in Milwaukie. Johnson runs again, Republicans hold the seat, in part because of the same electoral history as Toomey. Open seat, leans Republicans depending on the parties nominees. - Arizona (incumbent, seeking re-election) - There are two factors in this race: 1) how much money does Kelley raise; and 2) who is the Republican nominee. The Republicans failure in the past two elections was mainly the result of having a horrible candidate in McSally. Despite McSally, she still narrowly lost in 2018 and significantly closer than the polls expected in 2020. There are certainly worse candidates than McSally in the Arizona. If Republican nominate the right candidate, this a hard fought Republican pickup. - Nevada (incumbent, seeking re-election) - This state has become a state where Republican only seem to be able to pick up seats in a Democratic President's midterm (Heller in 2012) or when Presidency switches parties (Ensign in 2000, who did win re-election in 2006, against a highly flawed candidate). The Republicans are putting up an extremally strong candidate this year and early polling has him slightly leading. Given the trends, this is probably a Republican pickup. - North Carolina (open) - As we move further down the list, the historical trend really kicks in. North Carolina, more so most states in recent history, follows the wave. The only mistake the Republicans could make in this state is nominating a weak candidate, but the Democrats have the same problem. Republican will be favored to hold this seat. - New Hampshire (incumbent, seeking re-election) - New Hampshire is moving away from its swing status. The right Republican candidate could win this seat, but those candidates have opted not to run. The race will probably be close, but a likely Democratic hold. - Florida (incumbent, seeking re-election) - At some point, Democrats need to realize that Florida has moved out of their reach. Yes, with the perfect candidates and in the right year, they could might win, but this is not the year, nor do the Democrats have the right candidate. The Senate and Governor races always seem close, but do not forget the size of the population in Florida. A four point victory is not close in the state. Additionally, the margin of Republican victories in the state have been fairly consistent, in not slightly growing. Florida is a Republican hold. - Ohio (open) - As an Ohioan, I can confidently confirm that Ohio is no longer a swing state. Also, having followed Congressman Tim Ryan's career, he does not have what it takes to wage a competitive race in the state, nor the ability to raise money. Even if the Republican Party nominates a weak candidate, the historical trend will ensure a Republican hold. - Missouri (open) - More so than Ohio, Missouri is no longer a swing state. Easy Republican hold. There are a couple of other states worth watching. Alaska could emerge as an opportunity for Democrats if a three-way race emerges, with Murkowski running as an independent. Colorado is becoming increasingly polarized, Denver vs. the rest of the state. Kansas has been showing a distain for extremely conservative candidates and some odd trends. Iowa, even though moving to the right, is Iowa, who knows what might happen there. However, at this moment, I predict a Senate with 52 or 53 Republicans come 2023."

Arizona will come down to a very thin margin, but Mark Kelly is a good candidate and quite well liked, so I think he may be able to hold on even with the midterm incumbency factor against him. Georgia will also be incredibly close, but I think Hershel Walker was a poor candidate to choose and many of his flaws will come out in the primaries, so I think it’s likely to stay Democratic. The key state will be Pennsylvania, with incumbent Pat Toomey retiring and the state narrowly going to Biden in 2020, it will be interesting to see if the Republicans can put forward a strong candidate, as Doctor Oz is a very poor choice especially compared to the Democratic front runner John Fetterman.

Still, the Warnock (D) win in Georgia in 2020 was close and I’m playing it conservative here and calling this at even odds for the moment."

That said, the demography of historical cycles is on the GOP's side. They could quite plausibly hold their current seats and still pickup GA, and/or AZ. The main reason I'm not giving the Rs the overwhelming advantage of historical cycles that they had in, say, 2010 is because the higher-turnout demographics (white-collar, suburban professionals) have inched ""bluer"" in recent years and a 50-50 wash implies the Senate remains in Democratic hands given a Democratic VPOTUS. Further, Trump's unpopularity with a large chunk of Indpendents as the clear continued leader of his party could be a contributing factor to modestly stronger (compared to 2010) showings for Dems."
