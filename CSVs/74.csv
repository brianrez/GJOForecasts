Supply chain issues originating in China are likely to persist well into next year, causing downstream issues/shortages, putting upward pressure PCE index. 3. Small chance of a Fed pivot, much better chance of a slowdown in Fed rate hikes. 4. Most, perhaps all, statements I've seen by Fed officials say this is going to be a long process, lasting into 2024. 5. History says more needs to be done by the Fed to push down both CPI and PCE. 6. Oil prices swinging back up now should bolster future MoM PCE increases."

I suspect folks will spend less and less in real dollars, but I don't think inflation will drop to <2% so this seems very likely to remain above 3% by Dec 2022."
49937,2022-08-07T03:55:06Z,1,[60.0],[60.0],"This one is interesting. Inflation certainly makes it seem like this will happen, but if salaries don't inflate, then expenditures eventually have to drop. It seems like a year ago we saw 5-7% increases YoY but are now seeing 1.5-2%, likely due to the decreasing disposable personal income. I suspect we will continue to have price inflation, but not wage inflation, which will cause this number to continue to decrease as people spend less (thus locking us into a recession)."

I think energy prices in particular are going to explode as the EU learns what life in the cold is like."
