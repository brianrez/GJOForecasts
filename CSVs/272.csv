The 7-day averages reported by the UKHSA for a given date are derived from data from 3 days before that date through 3 days after that date. However, GJO has just issued a clarification that they will use 7-day averages calculated normally from UKHSA daily data; i.e., GJO will consider the 7-day average for a given date to be derived from data from 6 days before that date through that date. So, in effect, the question will be determined using data through March 31 instead of April 3. As cases still seem to be growing, it seems likely that the (true) 7-day average of hospital admissions will still be growing as of March 31. However, as growth in hospital admissions seems to be slowing, it looks unlikely to me that a 7-day average of 2500 will be reached in the remainder of the forecast period."

Indeed, the Omicron peak is long past. But unfortunately, even though an enormous fraction of the UK population just had Omicron, a new, enormous fraction is now getting BA.2 (which really deserves its own letter, and frankly should have been named ""Pi"" on March 14). The BA.2 wave is sweeping through the UK more slowly than did Omicron, perhaps because of existing immunity and warming weather. ZOE Covid data supposedly suggest that UK cases are at an all-time high, while UKHSA data suggest that cases are nearing a peak in the UK that is far below, perhaps ~60% below, the Omicron peak. The growth in hospital admissions has started to slow, which also suggests that cases are somewhere near a peak. So it looks to me like both cases and hospitalizations may be nearing their peaks, and it looks most likely to me that the peak of the BA.2 hospital admissions wave may end up below that of the Omicron wave. I wonder whether UK data have reached a turning point, where such a small proportion of cases continues to be tested officially that it is difficult to tell the relative sizes of Covid waves and when or whether a peak has been reached. This is going to make a lot of things more difficult for everyone."

Growth may be close to linear for a while, and it all also depends on when case growth slows down. As there's no sign that cases are slowing down yet (in the UK or other parts of Europe), and hospital admissions lag cases by about a week, I'm hedging higher on bin 4. If cases keep growing like they are currently for a few more days, then hospital admissions will be baked in and will likely exceed a 7-day average of 2500."

I think the decline in cases will slow and spread towards older populations, and still expect a plateauing or even a slight rise over the next few weeks, but it's hard to gauge. I think two factors will help determine this; the first is that prior infections were far higher leading up to Omicron compared to Delta - perhaps 17M total cases in the preceding 5 months (5.7M recorded), compared to 5M (1.7M recorded) in the same period before Delta - so the susceptible proportion of the population is substantially reduced this time. The second is the 53%+ third dose coverage, which significantly restores immunity, and slightly reduces transmissibility. From the data supplied by @belikewater below, it looks like transmission may take 6-8 weeks to spread through children and young adults into older age groups. After 6-8 wks in the Delta wave there was a roughly 15% net increase increase in hospitalisation/case, perhaps related to this effect. Omicron will be moving into more highly vaccinated populations (the third dose uptake increases roughly 10% per decade in age), and this could result in a lower increase in daily hospitalisation this time round. I'm starting to think we'll see increasing numbers of people staying in hospital while daily intake remains slightly lower, but not with any great confidence yet."

Also, looking at the demographics of cases from 1st Jan -> 4th Jan in England it seems that cases are relatively static in the over 60s 'at risk' group. It looks like the boosters are extremely effective against Omicron. I now feel that with case numbers starting to decline ~ 10 days ago that we are firmly more likely to stay in bin 3."

As social interaction increases over New Year and people return from any travels I think testing will increase and case numbers will go up further. 7-day PCR positivity has doubled to 19.5% in the last two weeks in England. With very little in the way of additional mandated restrictions in England by the Government many will infer that the situation is ‘manageable’ given some awareness that Omicron is less severe. All of which will lead to cases rising fairly quickly through January, as any new mandates will take a week to reflect on case numbers. Staff shortages through illness are also becoming more significant in the health care industry. On the positive side, greatest Omicron spread is still within younger age groups, particularly 10-45yrs, which should lead to fewer and shorter hospital stays. Booster doses, which improve vaccine efficacy to ~70%, are at 57% in England, and could exceed 70% by mid-Jan at the current rate. So everything could happen quite quickly, and bin 2 is now looking less likely. Upper end is still ~2,700 but this could change if the Gov maintains the laissez-faire approach."

Given Omicron’s 50-70% lower virulence there is less political will to increase mandates, so England will ‘get by’ unless the NHS is desperate, but severe cases should be far less common, so the speed of spread rather than total numbers may be the critical factor, especially if hospitalisation is a brief stay for the majority. Peak totals will depend on how the listed factors combine, whether other restrictions are brought in, and how quickly cases move into older age groups, but I’m I’m expecting WFH and more cautious behaviour to slow the doubling rate and spread the curve with cases peaking near 200k/day, hospitalisation following at ~1,800 to 2,700 if pushed higher by other effects such as health care staff shortages."

London has seen a high in its 7-day average of reported cases to date at about 24k as of Dec 16, and that has resulted in 386 admissions on Dec 22, only 6 days later, before hospitalizations can be expected to have peaked from those cases. I don't think London cases have peaked, either. I can picture hospital admissions for London alone reaching a 7-day average of maybe 600/day in the near future. And UK cases are at 90k/day and rising as of Dec 16. It's hard to picture how that won't translate into a minimum of 386 admissions/24k * 100k/day = 1600 admissions/day, especially as cases gradually work through older segments of the population. And UK hospitalizations were already at 1,171/day as of Dec 20. I expect that when hospital admissions data are updated after the holidays, 1500 will already have been reached."

There may be tighter restrictions in the new year across the country and there are from today in Scotland and Wales, which would slow the rise in cases. A peak case range of 175,000-250,000 is certainly possible before restrictions kick in or Omicron falls as in South Africa. The rate of hospitalisation has fallen from a 10-12% peak a year ago before vaccines to 1.6% now and was running at 2-2.3% pre booster jabs. This data (125k @1.5%=1.9K 175k@1.5% hospitalisation=2.6k, 225k@2.25%=>5k, compared to a short lived peak of a little over 4,000 this time last year.

There are reports of 50-70% fewer hospitalizations per case than previous variants (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-59769969). So perhaps 1 in 100 to 1 in 200 cases will be hospitalized. - the hospitalizations peak is also likely to be more spread out than the cases peak. Perhaps another factor of 2 reduction in the hospital admissions peak? - unknown whether the base load of Delta (~900 admissions / day) will continue or drop, but I can't imagine it being competed out as fast as Omicron rises. - I haven't really considered beyond January. Time for further mutations or developments to occur."
