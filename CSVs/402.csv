There is no doubt that the pipeline will go into operation, but the conditions remains up in the air. Under the EU’s third energy package it is possible that Gazprom will have to give up control of half the pipeline’s capacity to someone else – but that someone could be another Russian gas producing company like Rosneft (which certainly wants this job).
