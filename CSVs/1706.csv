What will be required is compromise. Europeans have long been stuck at an impasse with the IMF over the country’s current bail-out, its third. The IMF insists it will take part only if Greece is offered some restructuring of its debts; the country’s creditors, notably Germany, are loth to offer relief, but want the IMF on board. Hope and expectation were present at last month’s meeting too, but after seven hours of talks the parties remained at loggerheads. The clock is ticking: €7bn ($8bn) in Greek debts come due in July, for which a fresh tranche of bail-out funds will be needed. If a deal is born, it will be out of hard-nosed calculation, not Mr Tspiras’s grandiose words"

This is wrong. The statement that the ESM issued jointly with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF on 2 May instead says: “This preliminary agreement will now be complemented by further discussions in the coming weeks on a credible strategy to ensure that Greece's debt is sustainable.” Whether this will lead to debt relief in the end and if so to what extent is not clear today. The 25 May 2016 statement of the euro area finance ministers continues to be the reference. According to this statement, possible medium- to long-term debt relief measures for Greece can only be decided once Greece has successfully completed its ESM programme in 2018 and the reform conditions linked to the programme, and if such debt relief measures prove to be necessary. It is important to recall the principle that nominal debt relief (“haircut”) is not possible. https://www.esm.europa.eu/interviews/letter-editor-frankfurter-allgemeine-zeitung"

Europe knows that anything beyond modest reforms will not happen in Greece no matter what party is running the government. All Europe knows that Greece never did qualify to be part of the Euro zone. But it happened and in this case the reality is there is no solution. So you just continue to muddle along while obtaining promises for change and projections that at some future date things will even out. There does not have to be a final solution to everything. Procrastination and avoidance can have a very long life indeed.
