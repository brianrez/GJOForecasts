Just few wider thoughts on the issue if somebody is interested, how I came to my estimate."

But conviently Nord Stream 2 is basically operational and all it needs is just the last rubberstamp of approval and the gas can flow like nothing has ever happened. To be honest I would be surpriced if the Russians are not trying this move. The question is now: How react the Germans? Gas is usually thought as energy source but I don't see the main problem there. I'm expecting that Germany is just firing up it's coal plants (probably using lignite, dirtiest energy source of all) in shortterm and in midterm even taking back the remaining nuclear plants into service. But the main concern is in my estimate the demand for gas in various industries to produce petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, nitrogen fertilizers just to name a very few from a very long list for which natural gas is essential. And this is one of the economical strongholds in Germany and most important above all: jobs. And jobs in Germany are the killer argument against everything. In my estimate it depends now how quickly the German government is able to tap into other sources for natural gas. At the moment Nord Stream 2 seems to me not so dead like many think or want to believe. At the moment I give it a 23% going operational this year. Please let me know where you agree and where you think I got it wrong."

Four months ago, when I made my last forecast on that question the chance of actually Nord Stream 2 pumping gas to Germany by the end of this year was still a possibility and I'm sure the Russians tried hard to persuade the Germans to start it's operation. But now the political decision has been made in favour get off Russian energy and taking a more supportive stance towards Ukraine by sending more lethal and heavy weaponry. Germany has been criticised for it's reluctance (And rightfully criticised, in my opinion) but to Germany's defence: It's not a easy turn arround for Germans after 70 years of a more peaceful and by times pacifist policy in Europe and especially towards Russia so energy and trade policy has been one aspect of it and as we know today Putin sees something like this as weakness happy to exploit it for his ( or in his view for Russia's) advantage. It's a long and hard earned and still fragile trust from countries like Poland and France. So being more assertive towarts Russia is for many contemporary Germans unsettling, but the shift in German energy and foreign policy is clear. Nord Stream 2 is dead."

I would estimate this actually to come, let's say 28% chance. On the other hand, as the Russian invasion seems not really progressing and the fact that the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Russia are negotiating, indicates to me that the war might be over in a couple of weeks and peace is (hopefully) soon restored and as a result sanctions from the West might be also lifted soon and Nord Stream 2 is going into operation. At the moment, my estimate the Russians are withdrawing from Ukraine by mid April is 56%. The biggest factor however for my estimate of 14% as answer of the actual question is that Germany will actively try to be energy independent from Russia as soon as possible, and that I see as the reason we won't see Nord Stream 2 going online at all. And as always I would appreaciate if you guys would point out my mistakes and blind spots. Thank you."

100264,2022-02-26T07:02:03Z,1,[46.0],[46.0],"We are now three into the invasion and Europeans are already crumbling when it comes to the severity of sanctions. Furthermore I'm not sure how much the public is aware of all the economic interdependance between Russia and Europe and I have to say, that doesn't look too good for Europe, unfortunetaly. And talking about Germany in specific, getting out of coal and nuclear at the same time to be replaced by Russian gas and later by renewables. That was pretty bad plan from the beginning, and now we see why. This is going to drive energy prices further Germans have already pretty much the most expensive energy. Annalena Baerbock already said, they don't want kick Russia out of SWIFT because then Germany can't pay the Russian enery bills. Probably we will also see that the nuclear power plants came back online after switching them of suposedly permanently beginning of the year. But the problem here is, they might be recoverable for short to midterm energy production until the fuel runs out. The longterm issues: Because the nuclear exit was decided after Fukushima (ten years ago). The contracts for nuclear fuel delivery were subsequently cancelled and to get fresh nuclear fuel needs many years of planning and processing until delivery. And second there might be not enough knowhow to run these things, the current nuclear engineers are now for ten years aging into retirement and there aren't young ones coming after to replace them, cause career in that field is a dead end so education of it came also to a halt. Peter Zeihan just dropped a short summary of Russian trade and economics, to be honest the prospect is looking bleak. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMd1SLkGQJM Please share your thoughs on my conclusion! What did I miss, what did I get wrong? Any constructive criticism is highly appreaciated. Thanks"
