This is an optimistic figure from media speculation, and even if they are oversubscribed, they may face activities of certain investors like the ones in facebook's IPO, when the shares were sold en masse to lower the price then repurchased at the lower price point. Therefore, I think the likelihood that it will be $40-$100 is the highest probability, with the lower side being more likely. The other 15% over $100B is a short term prediction, as I think even if they do close that high, their shares will drop significantly over the next few days."

On the other hand, Lyft's IPO ""puke fest"" (to quote ddorsey) indicates a weakness in the overall market for publicly traded stock on the ride hailing sector. On the third hand, it is April 1, but I doubt that Bloomberg would run an April Fool's joke about Lyft, given the likely illegality of such an act."

Uber has consistently invested back into new ventures so investors will be aware that they may expect to see Uber's value increase in part due to the IPO making it a profitable investment. On the flip side Uber has capable competitors with much the same offering eg Lyft and more or less nothing stopping customers from switching service. makes it possible (if not all that likely) that the main lift sharing element of Uber's business could change in value very quickly. This potential for volatility might suppress investor enthusiasm.

As of Q3 2018, Uber continues showing an increase in losses as it continues to invest in future growth areas ($527 million in losses on an EBITDA basis). As it keeps expanding its operations throughout the world, monthly active riders and number of rides delivered are expected to continue growing. On its part, Eats showed a growth over 150% year over year according to the Q3 2018 financial results. A recent valuation by Wall Street bankers came in at $120 million, which surprised investors as it appears to be quite high. Thus, the valuation between $70 billion and $100 billion appears more likely. Considering that competitor firm Lyft has also announced an IPO for 2019, it seems unlikely that Uber would not have its IPO by October.

There will be much higher quality technology companies (on a fundamentals basis) yet to IPO who may be planning for a pre-downturn listing, creating more competition and absorbing institutional investor money committed to the IPO market."

The question asks what the market cap will be at end of trading. I therefore took into account both opening price and first-day trading activity. Since this is the most anticipated IPO of 2019, it's going to have a lot of investor interest and likely will open above the IPO price and will trade on huge volumes the first day. Best Nasdaq IPO 1-day performers in 2018 averaged close to 100% above IPO price. I suspect the underwriters will want to be a little conservative so that some investors ca take first day profits on the hype. In addition, we should see lots of volume early on as investors try to get in, driving up the 1st day price. While a 100% increase over IPO prices seems unlikely, some of the best tech performers of 2018 saw 33% 1-day returns and they were no where near the hype Uber is getting. If the underwriters price the stock at $100 billion, it doesn't seem unreasonable for 1st-day close to be at 50% above that ($150 billion). I'm not talking about sustainable prices, I'm just talking about 1st day hype and valuation at the close. Given the current uncertainties in the overall market and signs of softening, investors might see it as a particularly appetizing IPO (irrational but not unexpected) and drive price up. This seems the most likely scenario. Given the broad valuation range, I'll stick with $100 billion for now and assume a 50% pop as most likely (60%), with 35% at $100-$130, assuming a more tepid response. There is a possibility that investors won't like Uber's performance to date and, if the market sags substantially, they could decide to wait, but given the hype I see this is only a slightly non-trivial probability (5%)."

It looks like valuations run ~$70 billion and that has been pretty consistent. I think there will be some IPO excitement, but there are a lot of problems with the company's balance sheet. So, I think it won't get near the optimistic $120 billion figure being floated. Typically, there are 50% discounts in this kind of scenario and given suggested evaluations by real investments being made, best guess is somewhere around the $70-$100 billion range. I'm going to take a slightly higher than default for the next bucket, and then slightly hedge from there."
