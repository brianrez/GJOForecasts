If the vote occurs before the election, I would guess there's a 70% chance that all Republican senators support ACB. If the vote occurs after the election, I would estimate it's a 95% chance, as Collins, etc., will no longer have a political rationale to distance themselves from Trump, either because they've already won reelection or because they're lame ducks. Given the current COVID outbreak, it seems to be about 50-50 whether the vote will occur before or after the election. Given all that, I estimate about a 7.5% chance that there's a vote in which some Republican senators defect. There being exactly 3 defections to set up a tiebreaker (or a net of 3 with some abstentions or Democrat defections) is relatively unlikely. Overall, I'd give it a 2% chance."

If the GOP were to need them to vote Yes, they would almost definitely do it, especially if it is after the election. The Senate also continues to push aggressively for Barrett to be confirmed before the election, citing precedent that allows them to use proxies and distance procedures to move forward even with multiple members currently positive with COVID. For a tie to occur, we would need three dissenters, six no votes, or some combination of the two. At this moment, neither scenario seems feasible given the makeup and determination of the Senate."

53391,2020-10-02T19:11:59Z,1,[2.0],[2.0],If Collins and Murkowski do not vote (abstain) then that means 98 senators are voting and Amy need 49+1 = 50 Yes. There are 53 republican (incl collins) so with two abstentions there are 51 yes votes assuming party line vote (which is a safe assumption). Mcconnel expects the nomination out of committee on oct 22. But instead of going to 0 on the forecast i am leaving 2% for the possibility a republican senator contracts covid and must isolate and can not be on the floor to vote. And it happens in such a way that mcconnell decides to go ahead with vote and rely on VP tie breaker. The question closes jan 5 but it will be over by end of october.

But the Republicans have a 53 to 47 majority. Even with flake flipping sides, it should sail through. The CBS news link talks about a recent judicial nominee that was appointed by a tiebreaking vote from pence but I don't think that applies because the bar association said that judge was not qualified and it was a more controversial appointment."
