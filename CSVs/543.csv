Steady improvement in employment rate, dropping 0.15%/month on avg over last 6 months. Continuing this rate would put employment rate near 5.0%, well below the 5.4% target by September, though rate is likely to slow as we reach 'full employment'. JOLTS index suggests plenty of available jobs (near 5yr highs). Unemployment benefits are extended until September, meaning there will be a small increase in jobs after benefits expire but the timing is unlikely to impact the release in Sept numbers. This timing could cause the number of people searching for jobs to increase, artificially raising the unemployment rate. Currently 4M are not in the labor force due to Pandemic and declining, with a steady 2M marginally attached and .5M discouraged - these numbers are probably not large enough to impact the employment rate denominator if conditions rapidly improved."

The article I linked below gets into it. My understanding is the survey response rates are down due to the pandemic and so it may not be as accurate as normal, among other reasons. Jason Furman estimates in the linked article that the ""realistic"" unemployment, meaning his estimation of what the employment number would be if the pandemic wasn't screwing up the measurement, is 8.3%. But many of these lost jobs are also temporary and could come back very quickly once the economy opens more. His estimate of the ""full recall unemployment rate"" is 6.9%. The big question is whether the trend in U3 unemployment reported by the BLS continues and underlying issues with the measure remain the same, or whether these issues resolve and the number better reflects the ""realistic"" measure. Additionally, if the economy reopens it could reflect the ""full recall"" number. And of course, all of these numbers are likely to decrease over time."
