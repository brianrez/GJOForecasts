There’s a bit of turmoil at the moment, and while indications are more that elections will keep coming there is a possibility that they parliamentary ones don’t. Local elections are due in April. If there is more unheaval then it may lead to some change, but we’ll see https://thediplomat.com/2021/02/pay-attention-to-kyrgyzstans-local-elections/ https://www.rferl.org/a/kyrgyzstan-japarov-parliamentary-elections-autumn/31127455.html https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2021/03/11/647060/Kyrgyzstan-parliament-approves-referendum-on-new-constitution"
