From a practical point of view giving a date 18 years in the future is painless, who will remember what Mazda said in 2017 in 18 years time. Will Mazda exist by then? Personally I doubt that new hybrid cars will be around in 2035 as they only provide a small improvement over ICE only cars. But if Mazda thinks it worth making announcements about what it plans to produce in 15 or 20 years time then I have to admit that other makers might feel its pretty safe to do the same, after all any executive over 50 years old will have retired before we find out if the announcement was just hot air. I had previously been assuming that an ""announcement"" would mean that there was actually a commitment to a plan to do something within the next model cycle (5 to 7 years) as per the Volvo announcement, but the question does not seem to rule out announcing what will take place in 15, 20 or 200 years time.

There is a lot of difference between announcing, as Volvo has, a date after which new models will be electric or hybrid and announcing a date after which you will only sell electric or hybrid cars. Volvo has given itself the option of continuing to sell non-electric or hybrid cars for 5 or 10 or 20 years after 2019. All it has to say is that the petrol or diesel only cars are continuations of existing models. How long did VW produce the Beetle or the Gulf? There is no hard definition of a ""new"" model. It would be very risky for a car manufacturer to announce it was stopping selling pure ICE cars, because there could be technical or commercial problems if it did so. For example there will almost certainty be parts of the world that have no charging points for electric cars by 2020, and although Volvo is a premium brand there will be countries and people who will not want to pay for a hybrid. It would be far safer to continue with the ICE cars until demand drops. Certainly there will be countries and people who will want to only pay for a basic ICE non-premium branded car until well after 2020."

What was announced was that all new models after 2019 would be electric or hybrid, presumably it will continue to sell as new models introduced before 2019 for a significant number of years after 2019. 2. The question refers to ""vehicles"", Many of the ""brands"" in the infographic (including the Volvo brand) are used on vehicles other than cars (e.g. Trucks, Construction vehicles, agricultural vehicles etc. It is likely that non-electric versions of these will continue for longer. The question refers to vehicles the infographic refers to cars. 3. The recent announcements that France and the UK would phase out petrol and diesel powered cars includes hybrids, but excludes other types of internal combustion engines (e.g. hydrogen, LPG. So assuming that in some markets hybrids are seen as part of the problem but in other markets hybrids are seen as being part of the solution it could be that the US would want hybrids and Europe would ban them. Petrol could be out but hydrogen could be in. It is possible that a small brand belonging to a big company could go all electric e.g. the DS brand of the PSA Group."
