I am revising my estimate downward to approximately 28 percent in line with two recent reductions in legislative oversight of the fossil fuel industies (coal, oil, natural gas) with many more to come. These included deregulating oversight regulations for preventing coal mining, oil and natural gas dumping and contaminating streams and river, and the repeal of a regulation that would have required energy companies to disclose their payments to foreign governments. The latter repeals a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule written under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law meant to fight corruption in resource-rich countries by mandating that companies on United States stock exchanges disclose the royalties and other payments that oil, natural gas, coal and mineral companies make to governments. Paradoxically, this trend pretty much negates a need to withdraw from the UN Framework as compliance is voluntary and Trump's actions eliminates the need for him to formally withdraw. I believe that the current activity rate on other issues, such as moving ahead on infrastructure programs and ongoing immigration issues would tend to relegate abandoning the framework to well beyond the first hundred days. I would go lower to 20 percent if I were as sure of the President's predictability as I am of the rationale for not withdrawing. Revise prediction: 25%"

32376,2017-01-11T02:32:08Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],I am making this forecast because I believe that they can't change climate change drastically and Trump believe it to be a hoax which is not true from scientific proof.
32372,2017-01-11T02:23:45Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],Yes because he will want to use that money on something else more important for problems happening right now.

He and his ""yes men"" are not only uneducated on this topic, but they are in great denial of climate change's existence. He will want the U.S to withdraw from the UNs framework convention on climate change because maybe he is scared of the truth which he is sweeping under the rug about the earth's future."

32371,2017-01-11T02:14:10Z,1,[65.0],[65.0],yes because Trump has said he is worried about other problems and I think he would rather use the money for something else.
32284,2017-01-11T02:12:08Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],Yes because Trump views the amount of money we give that cause too much considering the nation's debt.
32369,2017-01-11T02:02:43Z,1,[20.0],[20.0],I think they will because they want to make sure they are making the right choices on letting things go out with the navy and things like that for the climate change.

32367,2017-01-11T01:38:39Z,1,[65.0],[65.0],Yes. Trump is not a very big fan of regulated climate control. He previously said he was in favor of drilling and installing pipeline across the ocean or in our coastal waters.

Pursuant to Article 28 of the Paris Agreement, a party may give notice to withdraw three years after the date the agreement entered force and that withdraw will be effective one year later. Therefore Donald Trump will not be able to give notice until 2020."
32360,2017-01-11T01:07:31Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],The us wont pull out of the UNFCCC because climate change effects all of us and with global warming rising temps and changing seasons that have different outcomes every year.
32175,2017-01-11T01:06:44Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],"Trump does not seem to worry about the issue of climate change, not necessarily because there are more pressing problems he devotes all his attention to, but because he simply doesn't care.

32361,2017-01-11T01:05:05Z,1,[65.0],[65.0],Trump may want to do this but I feel as if the people will not want to support this.

32357,2017-01-11T00:53:35Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],I don't think the U.S will withdraw because Trump will be working on other things more important to him then withdrawing from a climate change convention

32331,2017-01-10T23:51:24Z,1,[25.0],[25.0],This issue-if carried out- will be highly unpopular with the general public and with many members of Congress. Trump may seek to cut some ties with UN and not be as willing to work with them as Obama was but he most likely wont make any major statements against efforts to halt climate change.
32354,2017-01-10T23:47:58Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],I don't think this is very likely to happen if at all. Trump took a side on climate change just to gain votes i don't think he actually feels very strongly on the matter especially enough to do on the large scale of United Nations
32352,2017-01-10T23:38:10Z,1,[65.0],[65.0],Trump does not believe in Climate Change to begin with. He will not want to waste money on it and being an industrialist he will not want to invest in something he does not think exists.
32349,2017-01-10T23:30:57Z,2,[60.0],[0.0],i think this will most likely happen because the US has recently committed to the signed Paris Agreement on climate change to reduce Green house gas emissions. If the us follows through with it it could cause problems and they may not give notice. it was cause less economic growth
32351,2017-01-10T23:29:40Z,1,[20.0],[20.0],"The incoming administration questions climate change, the possibility of this happening is likely to happen within the term,not in the first 100 days."
32259,2017-01-10T23:28:02Z,1,[56.0],[56.0],I think Trump possibly would withdraw from the UNFCCC. He doesn't have much of a primary focus on the environment and global warming. I don't think too many people will be happy with his decision if he decides to withdraw.

32346,2017-01-10T22:38:05Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],I believe that Donald trump will want to withdraw from the UNFCCC. In my opinion he does not care about he environment at all and will do what he believes is right and not what is right for the country. I believe that his only worry in the world is immigration

As well, this question is about the 1994 framework treaty and not the Paris Treaty, which I think is more likely for Trump to announce a withdrawal from. That said, I think this is very unlikely to happen for a few reasons. First, Trump has focused entirely on the Paris agreement in his public comments and has shown no interest in looking further back. Second, he will have senior advisers (ie Tillerson and Ivanka) who believe in climate change and will be advising Trump to stick with existing agreements. Finally, it is far easier to simply not honor the convention instead of dealing with the public backlash against a formal withdrawal."

However, this has symbolic value, so it's quite possible Trump will withdraw from Paris, but there are avenues besides withdrawing from the parent treaty.

26855,2017-01-08T19:31:21Z,1,[35.0],[35.0],"President-Elect Trump subscribes to the view, as do I, that the United Nations (UN) is a voluntary association of member nation-states. Member nation-states in the UN do NOT give up their national sovereignty except insofar as they voluntarily sign and ratify treaties with other sovereign nation-states. The UN is NOT any kind of ""world government"" and does not have any authority over its members except as they have allowed by signing and ratifying treaties. When the UN attempts to exert influence that is clearly biased or against our national interests, then we, the United States, are under no obligation to follow those programs. President-Elect Trump, I feel, believes that the UN is biased against the Western democracies. With respect to climate change, the United States has done more to save and restore Earth's environment than China, Russia, India, and the great majority of the other member nations of the UN. Yet the United States and the other Western democracies are supposed to take environmental measures that will cost them an enormous amount of money while China, India and Russia continue to pollute the air and water on a massive scale. And, we're also supposed to pay a hugely disproportionate share of the overall costs of the UN, which takes every chance they can to criticize and condemn the U.S. and its allies. I think President-Elect Trump shares these views in some measure, and it is therefore more likely that the new administration might withdraw from this largely political framework on so-called ""Climate Change""."

And to add a wrinkle, since Tillerson comes from the energy industry, slowing down this process might give him a chance to prove his credentials as one who is not beholden to his past interests. Maybe I am being optimistic, but for Tillerson to look the statesman might be inviting, although it will incur the wrath of the base."
