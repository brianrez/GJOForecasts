"Between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, will an armed group from Turkey engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Turkey?",2018-04-02T17:00:08Z,2018-07-01T06:59:08Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],114,654,64,237,"The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (The Early Warning Project). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 30 June 2018 and will be resolved in April 2019 after EWP assesses the situation in Turkey from April 2018 to March 2019. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilian fatalities occur in one or more campaigns. See (EWP) for examples.

State-run news reports that Kurdish shopkeepers and pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) attacked a Member of Parliament (MP).

Turkey has been accused of many human rights violations in recent years, however has not yet begun to kill civilians, and as an active member of NATO, the UN, and other international authorities, is well aware that this degree of human right violations will isolate them entirely from the majority of the international community, including key allies such as the United States. Rebel armies may be assessed differently from the government, however they do not appear to have grievances that amount to justified killings of civilians, nor would civilian casualties in any matter assist them in achieving their goals. The question does not address deaths by terrorism, which would certainly increase odds."
