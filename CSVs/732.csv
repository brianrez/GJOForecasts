96352,2020-10-11T22:01:47Z,1,[20.0],[20.0],"The Confrontation between Hezbollah and Israeli forces have gone back and forth for some time now, with various depictions released in the media. The Jerusalem Post describe how the actual war is being fought through the media and propaganda (Jerusalem Post, 2020). This fight can be seen through Al Jazeera reports that showcase false victories from official Israeli media accounts (Al Jazeera, 2020). According to Israel, they were able to thwart an attack from Hezbollah, while Hezbollah completely denied the attack and it was just a way to create propaganda. These reports not only increase tension between the groups, but it also escalates the possibility of an actual attack. Although the attack did not happen, analysts suggest that the fighting is not over, especially as Hezbollah seeks revenge (Haaretz, 2020). One of the last notable encounters between the two groups was in August when Israel hits Hezbollah compound in Lebanon after a short exchange of fire (Washington Post, 2020). As the battle between Hezbollah and Israeli forces have resulted in fatalities in the past, neither sides are a stranger to combat, however, most of the focus seems to be on fighting with propaganda.

Tensions still remain high between Israel and Hezbollah. Most recently, Hezbollah was very candid with their intensions, “and it vowed to remain committed to fighting Israel, as the country is paralyzed by its worst economic and financial crisis” (Times of Israel, 2020). Hezbollah wants to present a unified and strong front, however there are higher priorities. Covid-19 has required all nations to pay close attention and focus on the virus, “tension between Hezbollah and Israel has risen in recent weeks, at the same time that the coronavirus swept through the region. While both sides are busy combating the pandemic, they are also preparing for the expected continuation of the conflict once the crisis is over, while maintaining the existing balance of deterrence between them” (Mizrahi and Schweitzer, 2020). The conflict has not gone away, and tensions are still high. However, everything that has unfolded because of COVID-19 have caused a drastic change in direction. Both Israel and Hezbollah are working on building up their forces which acts as a means of deterrence. Hezbollah has been stockpiling missiles at a rapid rate, “most estimates puts the present number of Hezbollah missiles and rockets at over 100,000” (Iddon, 2020). Hezbollah, while fighting has been limited, has been able to still build their military force. While most tactics have been described as deterrence and proxy wars, there have been some deadly attacks, “Israel had been bracing for retaliation from Hezbollah since the killing of one of its operatives in a strike in Syria last week that was attributed to Israel” (Kershner, 2020). While both sides blame each other for the hostile actions, “no casualties were reported by either side” (Kershner, 2020). There is a lot of tension but with COVID-19, the troops have been limited. In my opinion, there is an 87% chance that there is not a lethal confrontation in Lebanon or Israel. Mizrahi, O., and Schweitzer, Y. (2020, May 6).

95394,2020-10-08T21:32:38Z,1,[56.0],[56.0],"Yes, I assess that there is a 56% chance that constant skirmishes along the border of Lebanon and Israel will result in further casualties among both military and civilian populations prior to 14 November 2020. On August 25, Israel carried out air attacks on Hezbollah observation posts in Lebanon. This came as a response to a security incident that occurred at the border. The activity was later identified as gunshots directed at IDF troops. Israel and Lebanon are still technically at war, and the United Nations force UNIFIL is tasked with monitoring the ceasefire. An incident a month earlier occurred when two drones packed with explosives targeted the group's stronghold in south Beirut. An additional confrontation unfolded when supposed Hezbollah fighters attempted to sneak across the border. On August 29th, Israeli tanks carried out strikes against Hamas posts in the Gaza Strip in response to the previous day’s launching of airborne incendiary devices into Israel, which sparked at least 23 fires in the south of the country. While not devastating, this attack against Israel was coordinated with a manifesto calling for a long-term campaign against their enemies by Hezbollah. Public relations between the two parties have also evaporated due to the UAE and Israel's announcement to normalized relations, a decision which is seen by Lebanon as a serious threat. Hezbollah later condemned Bahrain’s move to normalize Israel ties on September 12. Hezbollah is the world’s most heavily armed non-state actor per the Center for Strategic and International Studies. They possess manpower capabilities which are estimated at 30,000 fighters with a reservist corps that could draw upon another 10,000 to 20,000 combatants. In addition, they possess extensive technology such as surface to air missiles. Israel’s military stands at roughly 169,500, including 102,500 conscripts; however, they are spears across a larger area and are forced to be more defensive. Thus, Hezbollah will continue to utilize similar patterns and tactics to instigate violence along the border. Hezbollah is facing a major internal crisis in the shape of government mismanagement and years of slow growth which has saddled Lebanon with one of the world’s highest public debt burdens. Protests have erupted spending several religious and cultural backgrounds. In August 2020, when an UN-backed tribunal found Salim Jamil Ayyash, a Hezbollah affiliate, guilty of the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri. This further factor has placed Hezbollah in a position where their very survival as an organization may be dependent on regaining prestige through the use of violence. Therefore, the trend of violence will with a moderate degree of certainty result in the death of a member of one of these two sides prior to November 14th.

As someone else pointed out, one has to define ""lethal confrontation"", does that mean all-out war or invasion from either party or just a cross boarder shooting or grenade attach that kills one person? There have been several recent attacks with no casualties reported, but lethal action is not overwhelmingly likely but probable. Seems there is always some tension and form of fighting on the boarder, but no one is taking ownership of small attacks. A small lethal confrontation is likely before mid-November as both sides are assessing the other and building up for bigger attacks. The tensions will likely build into greater bloodshed. I am about 55 % convinced that some form of lethal confrontation will occur between the two armed forces.

Israel Defense Forces said “During operational activity in northern Israel last night, shots were fired from Lebanon toward IDF troops.

Hezbollah has already stated that they will avenge this death. Israel also took the strong initiative to strike Hezbollah targets after a bombing on Golem Heights was stopped. Israel is obviously not afraid to show their intolerants of any Hezbollah activity. Israel will not hesitate to launch any attack they see necessary to protect their people. On the other hand, both of these attacks were on Syrian soil. It will also be very dumb for Hezbollah to attack on Israel soil, but it has happened before. The more likely outcome is that Israel will directly cripple Hezbollah in Lebanon as a result of more violent actions toward Israely ideals. High tensions have already resulted in a skirmish on the Israely-Lebanon border when both sides exchanged fire and closed roads. Although no lives were lost on either side, this could very easily result in a bloody battle. The real question is, “Will Hezbollah make direct action to threaten Israel?” If this occurs, Israel will attempt to put down this threat immediately, which will result in casualties."

Netanyahu has stated that although both sides have political difficulties, “Israel doesn’t want a large-scale confrontation with Hezbollah at this time”. Furthermore, Israel and Hezbollah are aware of the consequences of a large lethal confrontation. Predictions reason that recent tensions could result in minor conflict, yet both sides will try to “limit” them. Blanford summarized that the consequences of a Third Lebanon War would result in “the greatest destruction and loss of life since the 1948 war, and Lebanon will be turned into a car park”. Although Hezbollah has the capability to invade Northern parts of Israel, they know the resulting war would destroy Lebanon, and likely Hezbollah with it. Because reports show that neither side is searching for Lethal conflict, I predict there is a 35% chance of such conflict occurring before 14 November."
95527,2020-09-28T01:48:25Z,1,[50.0],[50.0],"I say this prediction because Israel launched an airstrike previously and Hezbollah stated that a counterattack was coming, that attack has yet to come. So therefore I say that there is a chance that this attack will come before Nov. 14. Yet also there is the chance that Israel stops the attack prior to it actually coming in and hurting anyone."

On 20 July 2020, a Hezbollah fighter was killed by an IDF airstrike, leading Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah to vow revenge in the form of the deaths of Israeli soldiers. According to the IDF, since the 20 July airstrike, Hezbollah has attempted to cross the U.N established ""Blue Line"" border and has shot at Israeli soldiers, increasing tensions between the belligerents. Hezbollah's ""equation of deterrence"" policy makes it likely that more retaliatory attacks will occur, likely resulting in Israeli casualties. Even if deaths do not occur for Israel, they will likely respond with airstrikes. This assertion is based on how Israel has responded to recent Hezbollah incursions; shots fired at Israeli soldiers in August lead to multiple airstrikes against Hezbollah positions. Hezbollah's desire for revenge couples with Israeli responses leads me to predict a 70% of a lethal confrontation before 14 November."

By definition, this was a confrontation but not a lethal one. Since then, there have been no other incidents and surprisingly Israel is set to hold mediated talks with Lebanon over their maritime border disputes. There is no certainty that these talks will result in an agreement between the two countries, but it is a hopeful step in the right direction that for now points towards a period of peace. Given the trajectory of current events towards mediation, coupled with their lack of diplomatic relations and current state of war, the chance for a lethal confrontation to break out is about even at this time. Much of this hinges on the success of the upcoming mediated peace talks."

Khomeinist-Shiite organization's leadership, sworn to Israsel's destruction, has declared that it will retaliate for any Isreali action against its personnel. In July there was an Israeli strike in SYria that killed a Hezbollah operative which triggered retaliation by the Hezbollah. However, Hezbollah actions are constrained by its inability to withstand consequences of escalation. Israeli-Hezbollah conflict is complex and they have very different objectives. Hezbollah wants to destroy Israel and Israel wants to prevent its own destruction. Therefore I believe that there is a chance that the Hezbollah will just not care what happens to them and confront Israel, but I don't think that Israel would start anything. I also do not believe that it is likely that Hezbollah will be confident enough in themselves to actually press forward against Israel. https://www.algemeiner.com/2020/09/18/hezbollah-caught-in-the-horns-of-a-deterrence-dilemma/"

Given that this attack happened after the Good Judgement question was posted on August 14, I assigned it a 100% chance of attack. Also, on September 22, a Hezbollah stronghold in Lebanon was hit with an explosion that damaged buildings and caused widespread civilian panic. The blast coincided with “intense Israeli overflights that did not leave the area,” which gives a high probability that the blast came from Israeli forces."

Israel is far more fit to combat Lebanon. Lebanon has virtually no air strength, while Israel has some of the most technologically advanced aircraft in the Middle East region. While tension may be at a high level, Lebanon will be unable to respond on any level, unless they were aided significantly by surrounding countries. therefore if Lebanon were to attack it would be via ground or missile, and Lebanon still doesn't have the fire power to do so."

Although the two countries were in a major conflict in 2006 and there have been airstrikes conducted on both countries, there haven't been any major casualties. In closing, I believe that there will ""probably not"" be a lethal confrontation between Lebanon and Israel. It will most likely just stay political."

This rivalry started to rise when a Hezbollah soldier was apparently killed by a Israeli airstrike in Syria, which the Prime Minister said they will retaliate against Israel. There have been several airstrikes going between each country but nothing has been fatal. While tensions rise, I predict that this will not lead to a lethal confrontation. This is because there has already been a very lethal confrontation between these two adversaries in 2006 but this war effected both of the participants very negatively. Several thousand Israelis were displaced because of this war, rather it being a lethal confrontation I predict this will just be a show of might for months but then it will lead to political confrontation and discussion.

EVn though the explosion may have been an accident, Israeli political leaders are saying that its a “day of joy”. The Israeli government really wants a war in order to eradicate Hezbollah. Hezbollah tries to ignore this, due to fact that the economy of Lebanon is crashing and failing.

With this instability, border skirmishes are possible, and small mistakes by soldiers on the ground can cause large conflicts. Lebanon is one of the most corrupt governments in the world, and its people have been in protest since the blast; the Hezbollah may see this as an opportunity to wage more covert terrorist attacks against Israel and gain more control in the Lebanon Parliament in which they control thirteen seats.

Both sides have proclaimed multiple threats and have taken many threatening actions against one another. Israel has launched dozens of preemptive drone strikes on Irainian/Hezbollah targets in Syria. Then along the border of Lebanon, there is a vast amount of Israeli forces stationed in order to prevent any further attack from Hezbollah militants. Along this border Israel has deterred a number of small attacks from Hezbollah forces, but has decided to not pursue them into Lebanon. All of these actions from Israel are strictly preemptive and are based on Israel’s desire to only protect its people and interests. In all, Israel does not want to escalate the conflict with Hezbollah in order to avoid unnecessary conflict. Presently, Hezbollah has been reluctant in escalating the conflict due to their fear of inferiority to the Israeli military and their incapability to launch a large scale attack. In addition, the US has placed sanctions on Libanese forums and leaders that have ties to Hezbollah. To summarize, both sides have high tension between each other and it is very likely that a lethal confrontation will occur. Nevertheless, Israel is at somewhat of a stand still, and Hezbollah forces do not currently have the means to cause any paramount harm to the Israeli military. https://www.algemeiner.com/2020/09/18/hezbollah-caught-in-the-horns-of-a-deterrence-dilemma/ https://www.thedefensepost.com/2020/08/31/hezbollah-israel-soldiers/ https://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/14/israel.lebanon.timeline/index.html https://www.wionews.com/world/arms-depot-of-hezbollah-explodes-in-lebanon-several-injured-329556"

According to The Algemeiner, “Should Hezbollah, alone or in conjunction with Iran or other allies, attain the capability to destroy Israel, it is unlikely that punitive threats would suffice to deter an attack, as Israel’s enemies would accept extremely heavy damage as the price of success in their efforts to annihilate the Jewish State.” According to the Israel Hayom, “Barak adds that it is possible that Haniyeh was trying to reach an agreement with the Iranians about the activity of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, considered to closest to Iran of all the Palestinian terrorist organizations, after ""the escalation following the targeted killing of Baha Abu-Atta [last November] created tension between Hamas and the PIJ."" Based upon the information above and what I have learned about the tensions between these nations, I’m sticking with my prediction of there only being about a 22% chance because confrontations would lead to considerable damage and extensive losses and that there is a stronger focus on making peace than causing war. Also, according to Sherman Kent’s probability chart, that is mentioned in the book SUPERFORECASTING, my percentage probability is more towards the general area of possibility being probably not."

Hezbollah position in Lebanon is rocky. It might send some random missiles to test Israeli Iron Dome defenses. Deaths could result from that or Israeli retribution. Wider war probably not in this time frame. Coordinating with Hamas might take time and they would want rockets flowing from that direction in a war. In terms of international relations Hezbollah might want to provoke a bigger response from Israel to justify a bigger attack from Hezbollah but that is down the road. Could be wrong. How does US election enter in needs some thought.

Given that there are 365 days in one year there is a 56 percent chance of an attack in any given year. The question however, specifically mentions a confrontation between Hezbollah and Israeli military forces. Of the attacks referenced in the Stanford CISAC (which is not a comprehensive list) only 2 explicitly mention the Israeli military. If there is an attack, there is a 10 percent historical chance that it will directly involve some kind of Israeli military presence leaving us with a base rate of 5 percent approximately. [1] However, we are also above average in terms of time between attacks. The last attack occurred about 800 days ago. it is probably worth pushing this base rate up to say, for instance, 9 percent."

I suggest 30% because the basis of these informal ROEs (a) might be overstated and (b) don’t preclude inadvertent deaths. Not that we’d really be able to know the difference between an intentional and unintentional death. Also recent diplomatic recognition by UAE and possibly others following suit could increase pressure on Hezbollah to provoke ISR."

Therefore, I like to be lower than the crowd on this one until war is declared, but not by too much - the tank incident referenced in the question demonstrates that one single combatant death on either side is not just a tail risk.
