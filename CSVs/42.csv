While bitcoin’s correlation with stocks has fallen from its all-time high last month, its price is still largely driven by macro trigger points, like key economic data reports and central bank policy. Uncharacteristically, however, we have seen very low volatility in bitcoin's price over the last few months. Bitcoin has failed to make any significant moves since early June, with prices bouncing between an increasingly narrow range and continued high trading volumes. I do not expect that crypto's current bear market will significantly explode upwards - hence the combined probability of a combined price range of $16,000 to $24,000 is very high.

Where to break down within that range is more difficult, so I split largely 50-50, with a slight edge to the higher number. I think the low number goes way too low - very unlikely that Bitcoin breaks from its current price of $19,167 down into the $16,000s or $17,000s given such low volatility recently.
