So, since Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932; it will not organize a pilgrimage for the first time in 68 years. Saudi Arabia earns an average of $ 12 billion annually from pilgrimage and umrah visits. So I think, it wasn't just canceled on the word. And in addition, that's even it can be said to be a relative perspective from country to country (maybe even from person to person).

I’m not sure they can or would want to cancel the whole pilgrimage, but there is a good chance they may feel forced too. But they may keep it on but control who can attend because there is limited travel into the country, it is a desert so they can control borders and Saudi Arabia is also a country with higher levels of control on their people. So rather than cancelling they may limit numbers and control how they travel. On balance I think the second option more likely than the first - slightly."

Bearing in mind that Hajj consists of traveling widely around the Kingdom, only a domestic-only Hajj seems likely to me, and given the economic impact the pandemic is having in countries that have failed to control it, I think even that would be in doubt to a nation not culturally invested in allowing Hajj to go ahead for other reasons. As more nations suspend Hajj for 2020, I think the cultural price of allowing it to go ahead may start outweighing what Saudi currently still perceive as the benefits.

It makes the situation difficult, that therefore those who are in charge of deciding about a cancellation of the hajj have no incentive to cancel. Risks are mainly on the side of those countries awaiting SA's decision. The longer it takes, the less time there is for pilgrims to plan and think over their own travel, and the less safe the hajj as a whole will be."

More likely under reporting and like many regiemes, you stick your head in the sand long enough, the weather may pass. Outside of oil, the Saudi economy is hurting so leadership will want to see the Hajj proceed even if with severly restricted numbers.

Mecca is still under strict lockdown & a new phase of national lockdown to coincide with Eid was announced some days ago. With a spike in new cases over the last couple of days it seems likely more announcements including cancellation of the Hajj will follow. The question is therefore of political timing. While it seems unlikely that Saudi will drag out decision making as per Japan & the Olympics, there may be some advantage in allowing partially restricted business to continue as usual during Ramadan then announcing the cancellation immediately after Eid once the seasonal increase in spending is completed but in time to be seen to be protecting older generations in a culture where this is of great importance. This move would allow the government to consolidate the economic hit and potentially time the announcement of the cancellation to precede or coincide with the death spike that corresponds to the current rise in new cases, depending on the specific point of infection at which these cases are being detected. Since, as @cafebedouin has said, the pilgrimage begins in late June & resources spent preparing for it will be needlessly wasted unless it goes ahead, this factor is, again, pushing me towards anticipating a relatively early cancellation either at the end of May or the beginning of June."
