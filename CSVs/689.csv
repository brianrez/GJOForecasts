Of course the Church of the Constitution people are outraged that he's trying to do something not written in the Constitution, but then again the Church of the loyal National people believe he's doing the right thing for the country. Once again you have an opposition that's fractured amongst many parties who are taking to the airwaves and Facebook's and Twitter's to drum up support that most likely is not there, and the man in power is negotiating with the previous man in power to give the previous man a couple of breaks, like commuting his prison sentence. Overall I think we seen this play out before many times in Africa and come the start of the new year ADO will still be in power. Given the short time frame, 100 days, i am not hedging this for stuff happens."
