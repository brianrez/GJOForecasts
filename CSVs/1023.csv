Johnson stated he would keep the Chancellor of the Exchequer, therefore adding consistency to the governor selection process.

Complicating the timing however is any Christmas Parliamentary recess which in all likelihood would come into effect from wb 24th December giving the Government just one week after the election to announce to Parliament, as is the custom. That means the likelihood of a December vs January announcement is delicately poised. Any delay beyond January either implies the Tories have changed their minds on the likely choice (no suggestion of this) or that Labour forms the next Government (highly unlikely).

No matter how the 12 Dec 19 election goes, the government will be required to replace Carney quickly. This will facilitate a reasonable handover and smooth transition. My assessment is a Labour government might take some more time to select their own governor, hence the 10% probability of the decision being made in Jan 20."
