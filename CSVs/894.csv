It is well reported April was up 69%, which would be 6.59% for April. May is projected to be 8-10%, which would put the three month average between the 6-7% range. May would have to be above 10.45% for the average to go above 7%, which I find unlikely because it makes more sense for most of the unemployment claims to be in the first month of the lockdown. The lockdown started the last week of March. In the US initial jobless claims peaked the second week of the lockdown and dropped every week after that. So it is unlikely the UK May jump will be more than the UK April jump. I am giving the above 7% category a little extra credit because I don't want to underestimate the impact of the virus and because I thought we were heading into a global recession before the virus even hit."

To stay below 5, numbers for April and May would need to be much lower than any expert in the field expects, so i´m ruling that out. To get over seven we would need it to be their worst-case-scenario for both months.

Even under assumption of absolutely unprecedented severity of the current crisis there is fairly low chance that the curve will go so steep that the unemployment rate will shoot 3 % in over 3 months. It takes quite a bit of effort to apply for benefits and lag in putting all the registrations especially with government offices working at half capacity. However, the online system may speed up the whole process and the 6 higher rate would be achieved. Still while 7% unemployment rate will be certainly achieved at some point in future it is unlikely it will be reached in March - May 2020 statistical data."

The 950K surge implies at least an unemployment rate of approx 6.3%, however this is likely to be underestimating the actual unemployment rate - though not necessarily by much (the difference between claimant count and unemployment was about 0.1% in the last dataset). I am also sceptical of the forecasts made by financial institutions who seemed to underestimate the size of the crisis incoming judging by their economic forecasts from March 2020 [3]. I am aware this data will have been compiled quite a bit earlier than publication date but it should have been clear by the start of March the scale of the crisis. I expect current lockdown will continue for the duration of this question and given the economic package announced I don't expect another surge like we've seen with the initial spike. I think the crowd is underestimating the chance of a 6-7% unemployment rate as data suggests that is the current level however I accept there is the capacity for this figure to grow - even if not as much as the initial spike and this would take it over to the 7% figure. Given the post GFE baserate of unemployment being over 7% in the UK is quite high and adjusting for this extraordinary scenario I make 7% or over the most likely outcome but between 6-7% also being feasible."

Several firms estimate a 6% unemployment rate for the next period, but there is a high chance this could be a low-ball. Sunak’s proposal for furloughing workers, whose salaries can be paid at 80% on the government dime, will no doubt be helpful, but much of the damage has been done already, in a slow-burn fashion that may not yet be readily apparent. Johnson’s delay in taking drastic public health measures has given the virus more time to spread, and companies, not just politicians, have historically underestimated the economic damage that the virus can cause. The exchequer’s plan is also not without issues: The Economist noted that the furloughed workers, unable to work under the current proposal, would deflate labor supply towards those industries that are seeing an increase in demand; this in turn would prevent the labor market from operating at maximum efficiency (attached link)."
