Against: A ruling that the court has no power to void 'excessive' fines would not make good reading for those looking to a smaller State with less interference, especially in business cases. On the balance of state versus federal court rights, federal is there to provide overall guidance and i rather think they believe they can overrule states, and the matter of this case (a 'disproportionate' fine) should not affect that judgement. If there needs to be a further amendment to the Eighth Amendment, so be it, but this case I think they will vote for the the US Supreme Court's rights to stand, and for some post-fact tidying up on procedure."

Under Indiana criminal law, the maximum fine that could be imposed for that particular offense and subsequent conviction is $10,000 and his vehicle is worth 4 times that. If the Eighth amendment is understood to apply to states AND the circumstances of the confiscation are understood to be directly connected, then his claim should be upheld by the SCOTUS. The state of Indiana is arguing that the vehicle was seized under a separate act to his criminal prosecution, in a civil case. Due to TImbs admission while in custody that he routinely used the vehicle to transport heroin, there is a case to be made that the forfeiture of his vehicle was related to confiscation of a vehicle used for illegal activity."
