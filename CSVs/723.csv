As the most populous, wealthy state in the country, as well as the location for both companies' headquarters and three of the top five most popular cities for Uber, this threat seems empty to me. Whether that will get through to voters is another issue. However, if the past few months have taught us anything about the American people its that they do not like being told what to do, especially by people they see as rich elites, and it doesn't get much more rich and elite than a tech company demanding permission to exploit its workers through loopholes in workers' rights in an emerging industry. I could be wrong, since polling is very up in the air right now and most of my analysis is based more on logic than public sentiment, but I think it's more likely to fail than pass."

89039,2020-08-20T02:59:37Z,1,[63.0],[63.0],Our base rate here is debatable. An examination of ballot initiatives in California tells us that Californians have followed the money 70 percent of the time over the last decade. That is to say that the side that has spent the most campaigning for or against any particular issue has won 70 percent of November polls since 2010. That number - 30 out of 49 - feels high. Numbers have trended upward in recent years. 76 percent of ballot measures were approved in 2016 and 100 percent (out of 6) in 2014. But the median is 55 percent which I think is a more reasonable figure so that’s where I would start.
