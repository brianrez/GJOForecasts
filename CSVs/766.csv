In 2020, he's seeking a term in his own right against Democratic challenger Nicole Galloway, the state auditor. In recent elections, Missouri has shifted to the right, but Republican weakness in the suburbs has cut Trump’s margins in recent polls, and to some extent, those trends have also hurt Parson. Meanwhile, Galloway has been a strong fundraiser for a red-state Democratic challenger, enabling her to spend heavily on TV ads. Parson’s ratings for handling the coronavirus haven’t been stellar by the standards of other governors, and in late September, he announced that he and his wife had contracted the virus. If the Democrats are to win, they will need big turnout in Kansas City and St. Louis. Four polls starting in mid-August have shown Parson leading Galloway by between seven and 15 percentage points, but a late-September internal poll for Galloway’s campaign showed her trailing by just two points.
