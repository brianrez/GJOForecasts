75501,2019-06-29T20:38:29Z,1,[19.0],[19.0],"Having a hard time finding data on credit revisions, so i decided to look at Boeings financial statement. I did not like it one bit, i would not be investing that's for sure. The shareholders equity is down from 8.6 billion to below 0.5 billion in 3 years time. I saw that in 2018 they boosted operating cash flow by selling off receivables. The receivables on their balance sheet fell from 9.7 billion to an estimation of about 4 billion in 2019. Thus, we see days sales outstanding falling = they are essentially taking money away from their future self - They have a weird post called ""unbilled receivables"" that might alter my view, if i can find out what it is, it might make me reconsider. However, They do have buildups of inventory which is not great either. Inventory were about 40-46 billion the last 3-4 years but in 2018 inventory grew by about 50% to 60-70 billion. Could be related to the crashes, im not sure. Days payables is also slowly rising, because payables is rising from 10.6 billion to 12.9 billion in 2018, about 21%, but payables is already up by another 1.7 billion to 14.6 billion in the first quarter of 2019 = They are stretching payments to their suppliers. On face value they seem to do splendid with high operating cash flow to support their investment needs but it should be neglected the fact that they are stretching every method to incur additional cash flow, i do fear that they are masking a deteoriation. Even though this is happening, Moodys is giving Boeing a A2 credit rating, with the primary argument being that they have a huge backlog and a larger cash position or ""cushion"" to handle their debt situation and the expectation of free cash flow in the future. I expect that Boeing will reveal a much lower free cash flow position in the future giving they are selling receivables to boost operating income and they cannot do that forever. They have a cash position of 8.5 billion down from 13 billion and they have a debt situation of 13.7 billion, where 3 billion has to be paid this year. I think that since the primary argument for assigning the A2 rating is this form for cushion in terms of backlog of about 400-500 billion, cash position and expected free cash flow. Sudden changes has to happen that would impair these expectations. The incident with the boeing crashes could end up with mass withdrawal of orders that would result in less revenue and less free cash flow, it is a probable scenario with few withdrawals already but not that noticeable to the backlog. Given the time period from now until november, Boeing would have to experience a radical deterioation in their order inflow during the course of the next 5 months. I do expect that Boeing has a significant chance of getting their credit rating revisioned in the long-term, however, given the questionable reputation the rating agencies has, and the already very high rating is somewhat ""fishy"" to me. I expect that at some point Moody's will be highly compelled and even forced to revise their credit rating if i am right about the actual state of things but i find it unlikely to happen before november 2019. I will weight my highly subjective estimate with the current crowd estimate."
