The wind shear is low on the day of launch and it's scheduled to lift off in the morning, which is before the main diurnal thunderstorm hours. Further, afternoon thunderstorms will favor inland areas more than coastal areas due to sea breeze effect. On the other hand, this is partially an assumption that thunderstorms are not going to be part of another type of larger weather system. Further, the winds are forecast to be around 10mph which could offset everything I just said... unless these winds are taking into account the sea breeze. But the CAPE index isn't that high in some of the models, which is an indicator for strong thunderstorms.

I defined this as follows: 1) All prelaunch activities must be successful (all pre-checks, mating to rocket, fueling, etc) 2) Launch weather must be acceptable (eg, no severe thunderstorms, lightning, etc) within a safety range 3) Based on 1) and 2) a Go vs NoGo must occur, and finally 4) the Vehicle launches successfully. As I look at most of these, the weather is a concern for two reasons: a) This is the rainy season in French Guiana and the average # rain/storm days in Dec is 18 or 59% (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Guiana). A look at the long-range forecast confirms daily storms (https://www.wunderground.com/forecast/gf/cayenne/4.92000008,-52.33000183) and b) there are only 5 to 6 ""workdays"" depending on whether you count the 22nd as one. While my individual likelihoods for the JWST to complete its checks successfully and launch successfully are high (~95%), my biggest concern is whether there are enough opportunities for acceptable launch weather to justify my previous 90%+ probability of success in the given time window. Therefore, I am downgrading my probability by averaging the Logits of my prior (92%) with the results of my Fermi Probability Tree (65%) to get a final 82% value. If anyone sees a major flaw in my reasoning or something that I am missing, please point it out to me."

The fact that the telescope is underway resolves this piece. Remaining steps are transport, assembling, launch. Historical stats show high chances of success for all steps. Transport was affected by a strike (say 1%). Assembling and launch might be affected by Covid which is at peak in Fr. Guyane, but current timeline give a buffer of ~15 days. Historical stats on Ariane shows no defect in 20 years and all ground equipment is already on site; so delays are more likely to come from weather conditions. Target launch is Dec 18th, which gives another two weeks of buffer, so one month in total. Question is, in case of a problem, how many days can be lost? Lockdown, site closure are unlikely, so it's more about the usual 50-days process taking longer (30days more = 60% more time, seems a lot). All in all, there are not many major risk identified and we provide a subjective probability in the range of 70-90. Fact remains that there are unknowns, and the security/risk mgmt criteria to authorize a launch is very high, and so delays remain possible -> 10-20% easily incompressible."
