I think there will be more headlines once this issue starts to gain more of a following, but until then I don't think that this law will be repealed or amended in the next 24 hours. However, I do predict that this act will become more popular in the coming year because social media is becoming more popular and there are more new users."

And so any proposal would be filibustered and would die. If the filibuster were eliminated and/or some giant new issue emerged, that could potentially change things, although Manchin and/or Sinema would still likely block any Democratic proposal; I'll give it a 5% chance."
