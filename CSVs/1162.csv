Although, violent incidents involving armed groups elements and self-defence groups continue to fuel intercommunal tensions and remain the primary source of violence against the population. However, my estimation that an armed group would be responsible for killing from 75 to 125 civilians. The outside view: Deterrent factors to be taken into consideration: • Khartoum Peace Agreement signed with 14 armed groups o Establishment of Special Mixed Security Units o 13 Ministers represent the armed groups • MINUSCA (11,500 troops and police) • Special and International Criminal Courts • AU • CAR’s National Security Forces (NSF) The inside view: • In addition to 18 armed groups, there are a number of local militia or auto-defence groups, and regional mercenaries, which, allegedly, are all responsible for crimes committed against the population • According to INSO from January to April 2019 total 1597 security incidents recorded in CAR (source: https://www.ngosafety.org/country/central_african_republic). However, they are related to Crime with multiple perpetrators rather to an armed conflict/campaign launched by an armed group. • Peace Agreement casts doubt since similar agreements in 2014, 2015 and 2017 all broke down. • Slow implementation of DDR • MINUSCA criticised being ineffective • Special Criminal Court still not operational • Increased Russian footprint in CAR and lack of its operational transparency • Partial lifting of arms embargo by UNSC. • NSF still in reformation stage. Needs human resources, training, equipment and motivation."

Historically speaking, killings of civilians has occurred, but this is predominantly due to fighting between government and non-government forces. This does not undermine the fact that there are cases of human rights abuses occurring in the country, however, such as rape, forced displacement, and violence towards civilians. But as of the recent evidence presented, there is a very unlikely chance of a group that will commit any forms of systematic killings against civilians. https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/central-african-republic"
