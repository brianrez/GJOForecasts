To be clear, I'm thinking more of a fistfight or brawl that results in a fatality rather than an actual shoot-out, but things can escalate quickly. 3) The people on the front lines seem eager to fight. When you have that many armed people all stationed in such close proximity to each other and both of them are spoiling for a fight, they will find a way to make it happen. Maybe somebody will get drunk or high and do something that is misinterpreted. Soldiers tend to be naturally aggressive people and this can spill out in interesting ways. 4) China has been very aggressive and expansionistic in previous years and is now going through a period of unforeseen weakness, due to the combination of pandemic, trade war, and natural disasters. Other nations that lost power during China's heyday will naturally take advantage of China's weakened position to redraw the balance of power more in their favor - the only question is whether it happens in the next seven months, seventeen months, or twenty-seven months. Seven months seems like a bit of an accelerated timetable (hence my low probability estimate) but it could happen."

So we want to know (1) the likelihood of a military confrontation over the border and (2) the likelihood of fatalities in the event of such a dispute. Though I haven't been able to find hard numbers, it seems like military confrontations on the border are very common. Previous, quite similar clashes have not resulted in fatalities; it has been nearly half a century since an Indian soldier was killed. Many reports indicate that soldiers are not even armed. So- just keeping to fisticuffs on the border, I'd say there's something like a 5% chance of a fatality over the course of such an event. But then of course there's the idea that tensions are high, that both governments are nationalistic, and that China is newly militarily assertive. To me, this doesn't add much to the equation... a decision would have to be made at the highest levels of government to engage a nuclear power in overt combat. To what end? Standoffs sound reasonable, but previous such standoffs have concluded without fatalities. I agree that they could result in accidental incidents, so I add another 5%."
