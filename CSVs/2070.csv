""Fifth, even if these important measures do materialize, they are ultimately peripheral to resolving the real problem in the South China Sea. Of course, rules and norms are important to provide a common set of guidelines for all actors, and hotlines are useful when crises break out (provided, of course, that the phones are actually answered, as previous instances in the U.S.-China relationship have demonstrated). But the fundamental challenge in the South China Sea has not been the shortage of rules or the absence of crisis management mechanisms, but the rise of a bolder, more assertive China that is so committed to changing the status quo in its favor that it is willing to break existing rules and risk a crisis in the process. In that sense, hotlines or codes of conduct are of limited utility unless they are accompanied by a change in Beijing’s calculations and resulting approach."

With growing concerns about China’s extensive land reclamation activities and the further militarization of some of its facilities, some have feared that Beijing will soon impose an ADIZ in the South China Sea similar to the one it declared over the East China Sea in November 2013 (See: “How Close is China to Another South China Sea Airstrip?”). An ADIZ, which would effectively broaden Chinese airspace and impose restrictions on aircraft flying through the zone, would be the latest in a string of assertive moves that would strengthen Chinese sovereignty over the area."

Since March 2013, currencies across Asia have dropped, in some cases by double digits. 1. The obvious outcome of this cocktail is a lot of defaults. While they have picked up in the past two years, low interest rates from the U.S. to Japan have impeded a worst-case scenario.

As noted by the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, the development of new runways and air-defense capabilities appear to be part of a long-term anti-access strategy by China which “would see it establish effective control over the sea and airspace throughout the South China Sea.” Comments: After reading this, I'm somewhat mystified by the consensus that the PRC would not be able to enforce an ADIZ (contrary comments on same article from @curva_fiesole July 20 post), even a limited one. A shoot-down is only one way to enforce a zone. Defenders can force an intruder down or fire warning shots. That said, see this July 20 WSJ article on potential managing of SCS situation by Beijing: 'China Warns Off South China Sea Protests': http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2016/07/20/china-warns-off-south-china-sea-protests/ Timing of a declaration maybe in play here.

In other words, the judgement becomes a new reality in an ongoing attempt to arrive at some sort of accommodation that both allows China a greater presence, but stops it from an outright claim on the zone."

Goodness only knows how they seek to reassert their position now. There's little doubt that the game has now changed.

Accelerated military buildup on and around the Spratly Islands etc. a likely test of bargaining strength before any big announcement. For what it's worth, I think it may be in the best interests of the US to operate as though China has already announced an ADIZ in the area. Nothing too aggressive - just a ""we don't care"" approach. China needs to know what it's getting into if it proceeds with plans for another unenforceable ID zone."

In January 2013, Manila initiated legal proceedings against Beijing for violating the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), a 1994 international agreement often called the ""constitution for the oceans"" that was intended to provide predictable, mutually agreed-upon definitions and mechanisms to settle maritime conflicts. Since all of the South China Sea's major claimants (with the exception of Taiwan) are parties to the agreement, UNCLOS should, in theory, solve any disputes that take place there. The U.N. Permanent Court of Arbitration agreed to hear the Philippines' case in October 2015, and it is expected to announce its decision by the end of June."

One of the reasons for this sudden decision is the expected ruling on territorial claims in the South China Sea by the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague. The Hong Kong daily’s source affirmed that “Beijing will take action to carry out land reclamation at Huangyan Island within this year. China should regain the initiative to do so because Washington is trying to contain Beijing by establishing a permanent military presence in the region.”"

China has controlled the whole of the Paracel chain in the north of the South China Sea since 1974, when it drove out the former South Vietnamese from part of it. It has recently installed missile batteries on Woody Island there. In the Spratlys to the south it is building what look like potential air and naval bases, complete with military-grade radars. Scarborough Shoal would complete a “strategic triangle” that would allow it to dominate the sea.

Short of a crisis, the larger significance remains political and strategic. The deployment signals China's determination to consolidate its gains in the South China Sea, regardless of criticism by the United States and its allies. Beijing has firmly rejected demands by U.S. authorities to “stop” construction or militarization of its holdings in the South China Sea. China appears equally determined to demonstrate that however much countries in Asia may resent it, they are incapable of impeding Beijing's pursuit of control over the critical maritime space. It is no coincidence that China has loudly promoted the potential economic gains of its “One Belt, One Road” and other regional economic initiatives at the same time that it has pushed its coercive, but so far non-violent expansion of control over the South China Sea. U.S. efforts to build international pressure through joint patrols and promotion of arbitration through international courts represent the right way to counter China's moves. However, determining the appropriate level of international pressure to dissuade Beijing remains a worryingly elusive task."""

An ADIZ requires aircrafts to properly identify themselves to the government to whose country they are entering. China’s bond with the countries in Southeast Asia would be ruined if China declared an ADIZ in the South China Sea. Also, Beijing almost has full control over the maritime enterprises in the South China Sea and declaring an ADIZ would not show a desire for sovereignty."

This might cause it to be declared, but, based on China's inability to enforce the region, it is more likely it will not be created."
22773,2016-03-24T07:00:19Z,1,[30.0],[30.0],"While the creation of an ADIZ over the South China Sea would aggravate their allies, China did recently establish an ADIZ in the East China Sea, increasing the likelihood of another one being created. However, most likely the strategic advantages of creating an ADIZ in the South China Sea will not be enough to risk angering allies in Southeast Asia."
22771,2016-03-24T05:53:18Z,1,[40.0],[40.0],"ADIZ is an area over land or water where planes need to identify themselves or else they will be shot down. China made one over the East China Sea unexpectedly in 2013. US has been increasing naval presence in South China Sea. Communist Army has full control over China’s decision and in general has aggressive stances on political issues. On the other hand, Most analysts in China believe that East Sea ADIZ was pointless and South Sea would be pointless as well. It is now expected and will not surprise people anymore. I would say that it is a 40% chance of happening because of the precedence they have set with the ADIZ in the East China Sea."
22851,2016-03-24T02:09:42Z,1,[31.0],[31.0],"Despite China's 2013 decision to form an Air-Defense Identification Zone over the East China Sea, I see a very low probability of there being one formed above the South China Sea any time soon. Their previous decision seemed to have come in response to the AirSea Battle Doctrine (renamed the Joint Concept for Access and Maneuver in the Global Commons), where the Navy and the Air Force worked together on plans to enable the U.S. government to be able to defeat adversaries who had the capability of denying the U.S. access to a certain region of their territory. This is most certainly the case with China as the U.S. has put a lot of stock into enabling free travel within the waterways around China for sailors of all backgrounds, inherently allowing the U.S. a greater chance of navigating these regions in order to properly prepare for a conflict. However, China claims that this act was in order to create newfound sovereignty in the East China Sea, as they lacked any control over the Diaoyu Islands, a characteristic that is not shared with the South China Sea. However, they have no way that they can attribute this decision to sovereignty for the South China Sea as Beijing has nearly full control over all of the maritime enterprises in the South China Sea. In fact, instead of showing a desire for sovereignty, it would just weaken the great relations China has with the countries in Southeast Asia due to border conflicts regarding the edge of the ADIZ in relationship to the island provinces that China and its neighbors currently control. Because of how these islands lie within the South China Sea, making a fair border is quite the challenging task as many of the islands are within a very close vicinity of islands belonging to other countries. Lastly, most analysts within China agree that the formulation of an Air-Defense Identification Zone wouldn't do anything productive for China, and could just serve as a way to aggravate those countries around them."

""In times of lowered tensions or when it so wishes, Beijing could announce it is easing restrictions in its ADIZ, all in an effort to show it is pursuing a so-called “restrained” approach. Or it could offer to ease restrictions as part of a bilateral negotiation with Japan — say limiting its ADIZ to just military and not civilian aircraft. But as time passes, and as China’s military prowess increases, it can slowly (if it so chooses), enforce the zone with greater confidence — if accurate, a very smart strategy indeed. In fact, China loses nothing with declaring an ADIZ it may have difficulty enforcing and looks strong, while Japan, South Korea and the United States all scramble to react and look weak — as many perceived was as the case in late 2013."

Considering the troubles currently being dealt with in the ME, it is clear that maintaining such a large presence in the Pacific is strategically of higher significance than other 'problem areas.' Recent moves by the John C Stennis carrier group indicate that the US will not be intimidated by Chinese claims over what is now considered international waters. Officially claiming an ADIZ would force China to either demand the US to stop fly-by's or look weak by not doing so after making such a claim and not being able to anything about it (especially considering ADIZs are not regulated by any international body). The Chinese clearly have no interest in direct conflict with the US. China only needs to keep doing what she's doing in order to achieve her short term goals. I think China needs more time to position itself to where it can realistically make such a claim."

More to come...... Clip from article: 'Chinese actions suggest that its leaders are intent on providing the islands with both an anti-access umbrella and a power projection capability. Chinese features would certainly be vulnerable in a conflict, but they would provide a substantial edge over other regional claimants during a crisis and would present an additional military challenge to U.S. forces, which would already be stretched thin in a contingency. Such efforts would also help China enforce a South China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone in the months or years ahead. Thus, the tactical importance of the deployment of SAMs to Woody Island pales in comparison to the signal the deployment sends about China’s long-term strategy in the South China Sea.'"

It has resulted in a rash of embarrassing and pointed challenges by the U.S. and Japan, and I would even argue it was a galvanizing influence on Japan in their decision to ""rethink"" its use of military force."

They will line up their military bases (check), line up their weapons systems (check), and line up (pressure) their trading partners and potential coalition partners to support them... which they are doing now. Culturally they are better at playing the slow hand than we are here in the West. If the question is whether they will declare by 2020..

But some MOAs have warnings such as ""be careful of fast low flying aircraft"" or ""missile range"" or ""powerful laser"".

San Fransisco International Airport (SFO) is class B airspace. Before I fly into class B airspace I need to be ""Cleared"".

But China continues to monitor and even enforce the ADIZ with foreign civilian aircraft,who oblige. Just because China cannot enforce the ADIZ with foreign military aircraft doesn't make the ADIZ useless or a mistake. The ADIZ is acknowledged commercially now and China will be able to enforce it militarily in time as it becomes more powerful militarily and economically. China is now moving quickly to open Woody Island in S China Sea to regular commercial flights. It seems likely to me that China will use a S China Sea ADIZ to enforce civilian flights in the same manner. In time they can enforce it militarily, and in the meantime who is going to remove, blockade or otherwise prevent their island(s) buildup? China doesn't have to dominate the US and Japan militarily before the ADIZ is useful. This isn't about domination through war - China knows Japan and the US will not attack or blockade any of its disputed islands. It's about establishing a ""civilian"" foothold on the ground, in the sea and in the air that is consistent with its claim of the S China Sea as Chinese national territory. Commercial flights would acknowledge and adhere to S China Sea ADIZ, and eventually the military will enforce it also. Whether it will happen by Oct 2016 or not is less certain, but I believe there's more than a decent chance. http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/01/15/asia-pacific/china-seeks-investment-for-disputed-islands-plans-to-launch-flights/ http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/01/14/asia-pacific/shipping-unscathed-as-china-flights-raise-south-china-sea-tensions/ http://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/International-Relations/China-nearly-completes-2-more-runways-in-S.-China-Sea-U.S.-think-tank http://thediplomat.com/2015/07/a-first-china-turns-back-commercial-flight-for-violating-east-china-sea-adiz-rules/"

Just getting to grips with this, but what is interesting to me - ""the test flights ""fall totally within China's sovereignty."" "". Now this means something if taken as stated. Hong says that flying from mainland china to fiery cross in no way leaves chinese sovereignty so therefore does not contravene United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to which China is a signatory. Equally by sea, they are saying not international waters? I am sure Hong will be corrected, but this shows the smarts of the vietnamese complaint"

Had Japan sponsored this tour with less or no notice, then maybe the increase of tensions afterwards would slightly increase the likelihood of an ADIZ. This IFP exhausted me in Season 4. Based on how sudden the ECS ADIZ was established in '13 (and subsequently shallowly enforced), I had predicted (confidently) the SCS ADIZ would go up last year, obviously I was wrong; this in spite of all of the activity taking place in the SCS over the last 9 months."

China will choose to quietly consolidate it's position in the South China Sea while the U.S. is distracted by Syria, Isis and the election. However, if a clear front-runner emerges who China believes will be much more aggressive, then they may decide to push hard and fast to establish an ADIZ before the next president takes office. But even this seems unlikely, since the risk of souring a key relationship so dramatically and so early would have bad long-run consequences. Slow progressions in the status quo as an ongoing background news item, rather than creating front page crisis situations, seem like the obviously better strategy and in keeping with China's long run planning."

Obama administration was criticized widely by maritime law experts and pentagon officials after first FONOP around Subi Reef, many saying it may have actually strengthened China's claim by being conducted as basically an innocent passage through a foreign countries territorial waters (see link). The upcoming FONOP will likely include activities that are not allowed in territorial waters, thereby actually achieving the goal the US had originally sought with its first FONOP. These activities (use of sonar, aerial recon etc) will undoubtedly bring a more stern response from Beijing. Washington's fumbling of the first FONOP may better explain China's subdued reaction more than their unwillingness to further provoke US with overt militarization of its facilities in S China sea. The second FONOP may produce a different reaction. Also, Philippines arbitration case with UNCLOS should be ruled by Oct 2016. Indonesia has recently expressed interest in possibly submitting a case for arbitration as well. All adds to up to an ADIZ declaration in my view, but I'm not sure if they will do so by Oct 2016. Many experts say China's premature declaration of ADIZ in E China Sea was an embarrassment since it could not be enforced when challenged by US B-52's. That declaration also hurt relations with S Korea. I believe China will continue its current phase of conciliatory negotiations with Vietnam and Indonesia until the UNCLOS ruling on the Philippines case. If that ruling goes in the Philippines' favor and/ or Indonesia and Vietnam follow the same path then I think there's a high likelihood of an ADIZ declaration. https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2015-12-03/innocent-mistake http://thediplomat.com/2015/11/next-us-navy-south-china-sea-freedom-of-navigation-operation-mischief-reef/ http://thediplomat.com/2015/11/what-chinas-militarization-of-the-south-china-sea-would-actually-look-like/"

China has intentionally maintained ambiguity about what its exact claims in the SCS are and what the legal rationale for these claims happen to be. Its claims over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands are much clearer, and declaring an ADIZ over them was a natural next step. China will not declare an ADIZ in the SCS until it has clarified its SCS claims. I do not think this is likely until after the Hague decision, at the earliest. And even there the stakes are high--by keeping its claims ambiguous China divides the other powers in the region. China does not need to declare an ADIZ to gain de facto control of many of its claims, most of which are disputed only by one other state. Not so with an ADIZ!"

Since China has significant military and economic advantages over the other Asian nations involved in the South China Sea conflict, but does not advantages over the U.S. in terms of aerial military power, it is likely to declare an ADIZ, because it is the only option where it can display military and territorial dominance over its Asian adversaries."

They may make the SCS ADIZ more traditional by simply requiring civilian aircraft to comply, not military. This as per US and Japan ADIZ strategies (http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R43894.pdf). Then B52s can fly through it without being an embarrassment. 3. They genuinely believe that these islands are theirs. No one is convincing them otherwise.

Once China has built up enough infrastructure on its island bases there is no reason that J-11s or another type of fighter or bomber couldn’t be stationed on those islands permanently.

An ADIZ only benefits a country if others honor it, granting legitimacy to the claim. In this recent incident the USA has shown that it will not (or cannot afford to) legitimize China's territorial ambitions in the SCS.

The joint drills will last 6 days and will include live fire, different type of scenarios' implementation (natural disasters, hijacking...). These exercises point at the capacity of the Chinese fleet to control the Malacca Strait through which 80% of the crude oil imported to China pass. The other important point underlined by several researchers in the article is the presence of Malaysia, which could mean that some ASEAN countries might see the Chinese as an alternative to the U.S. protection of the region. China is showing the muscles and doesn't have to invest and waste money to enlarge the ADIZ, which was made to be a strategical surprise and response to Japan in the first place. In the end it has achieved the same result with the joint drills with Malaysia."

To become one of the first world economic powers is only a step, the first military power of the region another step and next challenging the US . Whether in the PLA, the Chinese communist party or the government, there is a shared common nationalistic feeling that China has as much a right as the US, and maybe more right, to exert their sovereignty over the region. In a naval conference this week in London reported by defensenews.com, Chinese Vice Adm. Yuan Yubai, commander of the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s northern fleet, has been reported to say that “The South China Sea, as the name indicates, is a sea area that belongs to China. And the sea from the Han dynasty a long time ago where the Chinese people have been working and producing from the sea.” China has just started to get a real control over the ADIZ, id est adequate technical and military control of the airspace, according to their goals. They have forced airlines to comply to their set of rules. But this week Japanese Prime Minister Abe succeeded in having passed the law which would allow the Japanese Army not only to be used in self-defense but also to defend Japan's allies. ""Earlier this year, Japan and the Philippines held joint military exercises for the first time,"" wrote Shannon Hayden in Vice News yesterday. As 09/18/2015, South Korea and the US joined in a common military exercise with real ammunition as a retaliation to North Korea moves, even though it might be interpreted to a warning for China, as dispute stands with South Korea over the Socotra Islands. It looks very much like the containment strategy used by President Truman in other times. PRC would probably not expand the ADIZ in the near future but the China South Sea is living off renewed tensions and military escalation in a world of global economic uncertainties and setbacks. Part of the Chinese strategy has been to stealthily prepare a road map and to act quickly against the odds. They might do it again if they sense a weakened US in the eve of a new presidential election."

From China's point of view, they have been aggressive lately in their territorial claims, but an ADIZ is a formal declaration. If it is too wide and is routinely violated, then it will mandate a battlefield response. Which is actually bad for everybody. IF the ADIZ is too narrow, then it appears to undercut the recent territorial claims. To me, it seems that they will establish an ADIZ off their direct coast and continue to lay claim and building activities to a larger swath. If they believe that greater power is achieved by a mutual South China Sea agreement (across all parties), then they are more apt to establish a reasonable ADIZ; and negotiate the final demarcation. If they think greater power is achieved by antagonism with all other parties, the ADIZ will be established wider. To continue to do nothing, seems too weak a response."

Importantly, the SCS is an even a more sensitive issue with the U.S. We would test its effectiveness immediately forcing the Chinese to decide whether it was the time and place to take on the U.S. militarily.

China is investing heavily in the island development plan and incrementally increasing it's ability to control the ocean and airspace surrounding the new island bases. At the moment the US is able to overfly and sail by the new island bases with relative impunity and thereby embarrass China. I don't believe this will remain easy or risk free for long as China deploys more capable C3&I / surveillance systems, weapons, aircraft and personnel. China will eventually prevail in this area unless the US is prepared to go to war over these enhanced Chinese islands and sovereignty claims. China will be able to sit on it's new islands with relatively low cost and physical risk compared to any threatening US air and naval forces. The only long term question is the pace of investment by China."

43,2015-09-15T18:21:23Z,2,[10.0],[0.0],"South China Sea ADIZ -- really??? Does China want to have to rush around censoring the humiliating videos the U.S. Navy will air as its fighter pilots buzz cheerfully around their sandpile ""islands"" and ships? The U.S. is being proactive in letting China know that it can't even detect U.S. aircraft in the South China Sea, much less impose an ADIZ. It's pathetic when China has to learn by watching CNN's video evidence of Navy pilot exploits over their artificial islands. It will be a long time before China would have any hope of enforcing an ADIZ. It is unlikely to subject itself to another source of incessant humiliation as has been the case with its much-abused East China Sea ADIZ."
1004,2015-09-15T17:37:27Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],"Unlikely, however I expect that there will be sufficient activity (man-made islands, air-force intercepts, etc)."

China has declared an ADIZ in the East China Sea as a hedge for disputed claims. The buildout of islands in the South China Sea is not ceasing and will provide the logistics for China to police an ADIZ. However, China may use these islands to police claimed territory and project power without actually declaring an ADIZ. In this regard, an effective claim could be made. Questions to consider: how would regional actors react to an ADIZ? How would China enforce and ADIZ? What legal claim do they have for an ADIZ?"

530,2015-09-15T14:25:27Z,1,[74.0],[74.0],This is the logical progression of China's actions in the South China Sea. China has been taking/creating islands in the area and is now constructing airstrips. Their lack of a full-scale blue water navy means their only way to exert influence over the area is through air superiority or denial of airspace. China moves slowly but deliberately. Sometimes so slowly it's hard to determine what their ultimate goal is.
212,2015-09-15T14:22:38Z,1,[65.0],[65.0],"I think its more likely that China will declare such a zone considering that it has built three airstrips in the regions now ( http://www.theage.com.au/world/south-china-sea-china-building-third-airstrip-on-disputed-islets-expert-20150914-gjml2x.html ). Combined with a policy of ""‘salami-slicing’—using small, incremental actions, none of which by itself is a casus belli"" ( http://amti.csis.org/south-china-sea-civilian-air-patrol-capability-and-the-u-s-japan-alliance/ ), China seems to be just slowly doing little things which it can get away with."

Establishment of an ADIZ would be likely as a natural result of their increased militarization of the South China Sea. Recent moves by the US in support of other nations with competing claims and interests in the region will increase China's desire to exert control over airspace in the disputed area to protect its military assets, notwithstanding activities such as the continuing US surveillance flights over its submarine base. All these tend to be aggravating factors."

64,2015-09-15T10:05:44Z,1,[25.0],[25.0],"Though the Chinese wants to dominate the South China Sea, they are probably not in a hurry to declare an ADIZ. China sees itself very differently vis-a-vis Japan than it does vis-a-vis its more southern neighbors. It does not need to posture as aggressively, but would rather look to a long term relationship where China is their paternal mentor. The wild-card is that if things go really South in China, it may be convenient to get the population to focus outward."

38,2015-09-15T03:15:31Z,1,[57.0],[57.0],I followed a question like this last year. All the analysts expected China to declare an ADIZ as soon as the runways that they were building were complete.
182,2015-09-15T02:26:03Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"With the Chinese economy in trouble it seems unlikely this will come to pass in the next year. Although relations with Vietnam and the Phillipines have been strained over this issue, the Chinese can not afford to hurt any export markets. The only reason I don't give this <1% is if the government needs to deflect attention from the economy if worse news is on the near horizon. In that event, I would look for a series of charges against neighbors that would give China ""cover"" to declare the ADIZ. On the hand, if the Chinese economy reverses its decline and picks up steam then I'll have to rethink this predicition."

Yes, they are building runways on the piles of sand they've been dredging up, but turning that into a complete system to support the fighter pilots who don't yet know how to fly well enough is going to take lots of time."
