There is no benefit to US in attacking Iran. Iran proactively attacking US will be out of question. The most likely possibility of the two military coming in to contact is at sea or at air. In the last five years Iran did not come into direct contact with US naval ship in the gulf region. The possibility of any lethal confrontation between their navies is unlikely. Since the US air force is present in the gulf region and may come into close range with Iranian air force is possible. However, in such a situation Iran will likely to back off because US air force is much superior and any attack by Iran will lead to severe retaliation by US. There is not much to gain by either side the chances of a lethal confrontation is very low. Less than 3%"

Its in the the US interest, Russian and Saudi interests to push Iran back and keep its oil out of international markets (the three oil/gas producers benefiting from the higher prices that occur if Iran's output is blocked). Russia could be going to let the US/Israel more directly attack Iranian forces in Syria (as Russia can't as its supposed to be working with Iran) or the US might have agreed to keep out of Syria completely.

Eugene Black announced that its arrival “sends a powerful signal to our partners that we are committed to maintaining peace and security in the region and everywhere that there is a threat of terrorism.” DEBKAfile’s military sources report that the strike group is sending an even more powerful signal to US adversaries: The Trump administration looks with extreme disfavor on the mounting cooperation between Russian, Iranian, Syrian and Hizballah military forces and their aggressive intent, especially with respect to the US outpost at Al Tanf which controls the point of intersection between the Syrian, Iraqi and Jordanian borders.""

From War Is Boring - a little historical contrast - As tensions escalated in the Middle East over the civil war in Syria, in April 2018 the United States deployed one of the largest naval forces to the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The carrier strike group, centered on Nimitz-class nuclear-powered supercarrier USS Harry S. Truman, seven surface combatants and two submarines departed stateside for the region on April 11. They were scheduled to join a guided-missile cruiser, three guided-missile destroyers and a nuclear-powered attack submarine already in the Mediterranean to form a 15-ship-strong naval task force. In addition, the USS Essex expeditionary strike group was slated to deploy to the area. Along with its escorts, the Essex would embark a squadron of Lockheed F-35B Lightning IIs, representing the long-awaited operational debut of the Joint Strike Fighter. While it may be the largest U.S. naval deployment to the region since the start of the Iraq war, much of the sea power involved in that conflict deployed to the Persian Gulf. Even in the 1991 Gulf War, which involved a larger force, the carriers operated from the Gulf and the Red Sea. In actuality, the largest American naval deployment to the Mediterranean occurred 36 years ago during a war that didn’t directly involve the United States. On June 6, 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon in response to an increasing number of provocations by the Palestinians. In some of the fiercest fighting of the modern era, the Israelis made quick of its adversaries, one of which was the military of Syria under the rule of Hafez Al Assad, father of current Syrian leader Bashar Al Assad. By June 14, Israel was laying siege to Beirut. As Tel Aviv continued to place maximum pressure on the Lebanese capital, concerns arose in Washington and around the world of the possibility of the eruption of a larger regional war, mainly one drawing a deeper Syrian involvement. In response, the Reagan administration bolstered its presence in the region. The nuclear-powered Nimitz-class supercarrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and her battle group, which was on-station in the Mediterranean when the war began, in early June had been joined by USS John F. Kennedy, which had entered the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal from the Indian Ocean. On June 24, Eisenhower assisted in the evacuation of American citizens in Lebanon caught up in the conflict. The next day, two more carrier battle groups, centered on USS Forrestal and USS Independence joined Kennedy and Eisenhower from the United States. The result was a 50-ship task force, with four carriers and their air wings at the core, along with a plethora of other surface combatants. This powerful juggernaut was to conduct a NATO exercise codenamed “Daily Double,” but were also ordered to prepare for additional evacuations and, possibly, rescue attempts of other Americans still in Lebanon. Though the siege of Beirut would last until August, the situation had stabilized to Washington’s satisfaction within several days. Exercise Daily Double concluded, and Forrestal and Independence relieved Kennedy and Eisenhower of duty, sending the latter two home. This “dream team” lasted for only days, but it represented one of the greatest assemblies of air and naval power in the post-Vietnam War era. It was certainly the most powerful concentration of carrier-based air power ever in the Mediterranean. By comparison, two carrier battle groups were deployed to the Mediterranean for the Iraq invasion in 2003. By 1982, the carrier and its embarked air wing had improved by leaps and bounds from just a decade earlier. Apart from Forrestal, which still carried the McDonnell Douglas F-4S Phantom II, all three carriers were equipped with the Grumman F-14A Tomcat as its primary fleet-defense fighter. By then in its second decade of service, the Tomcat had already proven to be one of the world’s deadliest dogfighters. Armed with one of the most powerful radars of its time and the long-range AIM-54 Phoenix missile, alongside shorter-range missiles and a gun, the Tomcat would prove time and again in the Middle East it was one of the region’s “top guns.” Just a year prior, two F-14s had downed two Libyan fighters over the Gulf of Sidra, an area not too far from the shores of Lebanon."

Yes al Arabia (and a couple others) reported it but I struggled with info. Certainly seems possible. Also challenged by Trump direction, redirection, nondirection, nonredirection... Smart! No Sad! I don’t know! Regardless, increasing given I suspect there may have been some Iranian deaths and if not may be cause for other attacks in next few months. Odd in case of Trump it’s left endorsing attack and right that wants to stay home - so further incident could help with mid-term (appeal to left without alienating right). Suspect they’ll keep powder dry for now. I guess another way to look at this is both Syria and USA say there were no deaths. I can’t believe they would agree about anything. For USA it’s to underline Smart! For Syria it’s loss of face - didn’t they shoot 70% of them down with Katyusha rockets run on vodka? So some wiggle room there. Also Syria has almost won the war (with a little help from their friends) and there may be some action from outside to prevent complete victory.

There is the possibility that hardliner Netanyahu will be ousted for fraud from office and a less hardline leader will come to power. If it were to happen then Israel may not take action. If they do not then the US will see it as their duty to do something to stop the proliferation. The appointment of John Bolton has increased the probability.

Recently Trump announced his intentions to pull US troops out of Syria (although this conflicts with the opinions of experts who say US troops should stay). Further, Russia, Iran, and Turkey committed to implementing a ceasefire in Syria in the near future. If both of these statements hold true, prospects of military clash between the US and Iran regarding Syria would be diminished, while opportunities to collaborate on rebuilding Syria would appear. Additionally, the question specifies that the fatality must be a member of national military forces for either side, rendering the probability low. However, lethal confrontation within this time period is still very much possible. The two countries have a history of conflict, strong ideological differences, and deeply-rooted suspicions of one-another, which strain diplomatic relations. The Trump administration remains dissatisfied with the handling of Iran's nuclear program and missile testing. These sentiments are certainly exacerbated by the recent naming of John Bolton, who is known to have a particularly hawkish attitude towards Iran, as the new US national security advisor. For these reasons, I predict that a lethal confrontation between the US and Iran in the next 9 months is unlikely but still possible, with a probability of 15%."

Although it is very clear that Iran and the US have a very turbulent relationship that is the result of large historical differences and current matters, both sides have demonstrated that they are willing to rely on negotiation to resolve issues and promote common interests. The long standing issue that has divided both countries is Iran's nuclear program, which has resulted in sweeping sanctions placed on Iran from both the US and the EU. The sanctions have had a devastating effect on the economy. Inflation reached double digit numbers, food prices increased dramatically, and there is a growing divide between rich and poor. The government has struggled under sanctions, especially with the oil embargo, and was willing to reach out to the US for talks in 2013. The long negotiations that followed led to the Iran Deal, which is still in effect today. Although the Trump administration has referred to the Iran Deal, as the ""worst deal ever,"" he has received pressure from European allies to keep the the deal alive as their is no viable alternative. Despite Trump's seemingly decisive rhetoric, has offered sanctions relief and Congress is moving to address some of his concerns about the deal. However, with John Bolton becoming Trump's national security advisor and Mike Pompeo becoming head of the State Department, the Iran Deal is in limbo. Both are fierce critics of the deal, with Bolton arguing for air strikes against Iranian nuclear infrastructure. So far, however, there has not been a major shift in official tone and should it lead to airstrikes, it is likely that the US will consult European allies. If the Iran Deal manages to break, the administration is more likely to resort to more sanctions, which has previously shown to work against the regime."

49492,2018-03-27T16:33:03Z,1,[30.0],[30.0],"First and foremost, this question is very vague as to what it constitutes as a lethal confrontation. Would a lethal confrontation be a one-on-one military engagement directly between Iran and U.S.A, or can a lethal confrontation also entail proxy warfare? This is important to distinguish because if we are to operate under the assumption that proxy conflicts can be considered a lethal confrontation, then this has already happened. For instance, while U.S troops have killed pro-Assad Russian mercenaries, a U.S and Israel coalition also targeted Hezbollah forces in Syria after Israel captured an Iranian drone. However, taking it a step further, one can also make the case that Iran was indirectly targeted in this situation as well due to Hezbollah receiving training, weapons, and financial support from Iran (in other words, it was a U.S led coalition versus and Iranian one). Despite a real possibility of a lethal confrontation occurring, I think there is only a 30% chance that it will happen due to each country being very wary of their situations in Syria. Moreover, I would put the percentage of a direct conflict any higher due to Russia's role in Syria. Russia at the moment has arguably played much more of an active role than Iran. Therefore, naturally that chances of a U.S lethal confrontation will be higher with whoever is heading the opposition. https://www.vox.com/world/2018/2/13/17008446/us-troops-syria-russia-mercenaries-killed"

His appointment makes it very likely that Trump will not extend sanctions relief to Iran, further complicating the status of the Iran nuclear deal. It is highly likely that as part of negotiations for a new Iran deal the U.S. will demand that the IRGC be completely removed from Lebanon and Syria. Iran will likely not oblige as it is engaging in a campaign of influence throughout the Arab world. The prospect of further Iranian entrenchment in Lebanon and Syria increases the likelihood of a direct confrontation between Syria/Lebanon and Israel. As the United States' closest ally, it is not inconceivable that the U.S. would at least provide air and sea support to the IDF in a confrontation."

The question asks about a lethal confrontation between Iranian national military forces and those of the US, not between Iranian proxy military forces. When focusing only the question as asked, it is clear that all of Iran's proxies in both Lebanon and Iraq would have to be first exhausted and exterminated and also Tehran must consider US presence in Syria such a big existential threat that it would commit its own forces directly (a big risky move). The first makes it unlikely simply due to the sheer number of proxies available to Iran to direct into the Syrian conflict. Combined with the second, it becomes extremely unlikely because of existing extremely lucrative technology and hydrocarbon offtake agreements with Total... if Iran were ever to enter a direct conflict against US forces in Syria, the US would immediately pressure Paris to end those offtake agreements and cancel all oil & gas technology sharing agreements... something Iran can ill afford given the sorry state of its upstream and midstream infrastructure. It is true that equipment into active war zones is currently carried out by Iran, activities likely involving logistical support from local shi'a allies to execute which makes the total probability non-zero. Overall, Iran has a great deal to lose, both strategically and economically from such an engagement and will go to great lengths to avoid it."

US is unlikely to exit deal before next review, in mid-May. An effort to force a renegotiation will likely follow, then efforts to salvage something from the wreckage. If Iran decides to restart its nuclear programs, it will take time for this to be detected, for reactions to happen, and for the US to decide on its course of action. So a confrontation on the nuclear deal seems unlikely before the end of the year."

We are not in a good position for successful diplomacy right now, and the last thing we need is another state ramping up its nuclear weapon production. If the casualty is Iranian, I find it hard to believe that we'd be able to persuade Iran to hold up its end of the Iran nuclear deal. If the casualty is American, it will offer the perfect pretext for escalation against Iran and claiming that it broke the deal first so the US is finally justified in pulling out of the deal. Either way, years of diplomacy go to waste and we end up in yet another nuclear showdown. At the same time, because the consequences could be quite dire for both our countries, I think the probability of a lethal confrontation goes down. I assume that basic risk management would lead both sides to be cautious of unsettling the other, especially while the hard-won deal is still unsettled and our relationship is so new. If our economic ties to Iran were as strong and settled as they are with other Gulf states (e.g. Saudi Arabia), we would not need to be as cautious about offending one another. But we would also be unlikely to enter into direct confrontation. Both Iran and Saudi Arabia have a troubling history of funding terrorists, but Saudi Arabia at least has security and economic agreements with the US that make it unlikely to act directly against us. Iran, like many states, would prefer to rely on its own military deterrence power, but is tempted by the riches of global economic participation and foreign investment. Iran needs to have more economic reliance on the US and other foreign investors to further reduce the risk of direct confrontation."

Although this will likely be through proxy forces, IRGC-QF forces could be embedded. Given the lack of American troops on the ground, the chances of conflict remain slim.

And Donald Trump is known to be unpredictable and he likes it that way. But he is more a talker than a doer. And Russia is getting more and more influent in the area, while they are a friend Syria/Iran (they were provided to Iran with their nuclear program). Abd Iran was helping against ISIS. Trump's advisers will certainly discourage him from starting a conflict with Iran. But Trump rarely listen advice from those with the knowledge. Trump being the poor chess player that he is, never seeing more than one or two moves ahead, could decide to start a fire there and then let the other deal with the consequences in the area. Hopefully, in that case I hope it would be a limited and short conflict..."

Even if there is a confrontation, both Iran and the United States will endeavor with significant energy to quail the drama to a quick resolution. Neither Trump nor Iran are interested in any kind of military drama between each other. On Iran's part, while they won't admit this, they prefer not to fight with a U.S. president that 'just might be crazy.' The world agrees. There are few who want the United States and Iran to have a fight. However, there is likely to be a lot of politicized struggles between Iran and the U.S. in 2018. In this, I predict that everything that can go amok likely will, with the exception of a military confrontation with the United States. My advice to Iran is that in 2018 they put less effort into empowering their nuclear military capabilities and more effort into empowering their people to live a life of quality with good paying jobs and greater freedom."

I don't think Trump wants to go to war in the Middle East ... it will force him to work harder than he already isn't on national security challenges and have very negative impact on Iraq which we have just helped to piece back together.

Iran's concern now is internal unrest with the rise of prices of fuel and other comodoties. This is driven by lack of demand and surplus of supply of world oil supplies. This can not be resolved by a conflict with US military forces. Any military conflict would either be by proxy in other parts of the world. Syria being perhaps one key area but unlikely. The instability of the middle and far east at this time is maintaining a fragile stability in the middle east now because of a potential snowballing affect of multiple contentious hot spots around the world. Nobody really want to be the first to die.
44346,2017-12-31T18:03:39Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],Very unlikely. Cooler heads like Mattis and McMaster will restrain Trump bellicosity. And the Iranians themselves may overthrow their government.

Current efforts to liberalize (albeit modestly) their society will be a counter balance to the narrative that Iran (a Shia society) is a more developed and open Muslim society (as compared to Sunni Saudi Arabia). The Sunni and Shia world view will continue to play out in proxy wars and conflicts in the region, but not through open hostilities by each other. The US will not engage Iran due to the lack of support for this action in the US, but will continue to support the Saudi's in their efforts to contain Iran. The President will not want to damage his reputation by directly attacking Iran, despite his current criticism of the Iran Nuclear Agreement."

And happen what may as a result of such a confrontation, the Iranian regime knows that if it does occur, although the Iranian people may feel patriotic and support it DURING the confrontation, sooner rather than later AFTER the confrontation they will blame the Iranian regime for such a confrontation--and there will be a good chance that the Iranian regime itself will eventually be the biggest victim of a military conflict with the U.S."
