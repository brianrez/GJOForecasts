It does not take that much public back and forth to get to the candidate if done with temperance. I have the feeling the present disarray in choosing this cabinet member has lots of black hand undertones. Why no import someone from Russia now that we are widening the pickings? Tillerson might be the import, he has been a good allied of the oily biz in Putin's Russia, so this choice seem to be a good choice, but the volatility of DJT leaves some room for someone else to be considered this week. Tillerson's confirmation hearing, if he is the one, his dealings with dictators and bribery scandals while at XOM can put some fear for XOM present board, it might be XOM who prefers that Tillerson does not take it. This one is another one with conflict of interests is written all over. So DJT gives a hoot about picking the best and draining the swamp, so far the swamp is providing good supply of swamp dwellers. Top that with a 500 million tax break that Tillerson will get if he gets confirmed, so far we are at $1,890 Million (or $1.8 billion) of tax breaks to the present cabinet so we can get to a $2.3 billion gift in tax breaks to its cabinet, that would be a record high by any measure.
