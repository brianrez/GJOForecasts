That lead will be difficult for fund managers to overcome in a short period of time. Increased volatility does give active managers (not closed indexers) a chance at beating both their benchmarks and the S&P 500. Longer historical numbers may not be relevant due to the very low volatility in many of those years. Different styles have different results historically relative to the S&P 500. I used the S&P 500, the S&P 600 and the S&P 400 as proxies for the large, small and mid-cap styles and used a weighted average of subjective estimates for each, keeping in mind the starting conditions mentioned previously. This resulted in an estimate that 68% would be outperformed. I believe the risks are skewed to a lower number, however."

The average benchmark outperformance has averaged about 68% over the last seven years. The population mean is 59%, riding right on the border of two possible answers. I've run some basic descriptive stats on the data and tried to find a correlation with benchmark outperformance and some aspect of the economy or of stock market expectations or returns. So far I've found nothing significant in any comparative analysis. Now, this is somewhat anecdotal but as the industry consolidates and so many sharp minds, CFA's and PhD's, compete globally it is harder and harder to squeeze diminishing alpha from the market. Add to that the technology available at speed to aid portfolio managers, Regulation FD, which mandates full, fair and immediate dissemination of financial data - levelling the playing field for smaller or remote asset managers and the career risk involved if a portfolio manager makes a bad bet and the net result is performance in line with the market - its harder than ever to beat the market! Add in fees and this zero-sum game becomes a negative sum game and a larger percentage of active should underperform. Before costs, the return on the average active dollar will equal the average market return. Factor in costs and it shifts to less than for the active dollar."

Recent history would indicate an Index fund winning this contest. If the economy does not tank between now and June then the passive index choice is most cases will come out on top. If we have a major economic event leading to a market retreat then the active management of the investments will make my forecast look very bad. I do believe a major market correction is coming but I expect it to start in Summer / Fall of 2019 and hope that June will still be prior to that event.
