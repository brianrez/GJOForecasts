Obviously today's BTC/USD price drop has been spectacular. Similar to what we saw from 18-22 December last year. Possible that this is the first day of the ""fire sale"" and similarly to mid-December more such down days are to follow. 2. BTC regulation related woes are continuing. France and Germany are now calling for BTC regulation, ROK is still working on how to ban crypto currency markets and China's central bank looks to tighten ban on crypto currency trade. https://euobserver.com/tickers/140555 https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-markets-bitcoin/bitcoin-other-cryptocurrencies-tumble-on-government-crackdown-worries-idUSKBN1F50UV https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-bitcoin/pboc-official-says-chinas-centralized-virtual-currency-trade-needs-to-end-source-idUSKBN1F50FZ 3. I concur with @Censusguyz point that first BTC futures positions are maturing (17th of January the deadline for the first contracts) and thus at least ""hedgers"" on both losing and winning side of these positions are trying to cut their losses. Hence the sell side of trading could in my view see another uptick in the next few days. https://www.ethnews.com/market-manipulation-101-bitcoin-futures"

While ultimately recovering and far surpassing these declines, the current peak - if we consider only the BTC historic data - has generally been followed by persistent sell-offs.

This gave a possible increase in price by 26 January 2018 ranging from c.5% to c.197% on the basis of historic performance alone and formed the baseline for the forecast. The baseline was then modified to reflect a range of analyst opinions backing outcomes from Bitcoin collapse to a surge in growth.
