"Before 1 July 2018, will Tesla announce that it will build a factory to manufacture electric vehicles in China?",2017-10-20T17:00:56Z,2018-07-01T06:59:51Z,No,"['Yes, manufacturing without a Chinese partner', 'Yes, manufacturing with a Chinese partner', 'No']","['Technology', 'Environment']",947,654,520,237,"In its quest for global growth, Tesla is looking to expand its manufacturing capacity. There is speculation that it might build a new factory in China, but China's requirements for foreign automakers partnering with Chinese companies may prove an obstacle (Bloomberg, Electrek). An announcement by Tesla regarding a factory that only manufactures component parts of an electric vehicle will not count (e.g. Electrek). Confused?

I assume he is planning on selling primarily the Model 3 in China. If he could get production on Model 3 up to pace, he could test the market in China with the lower tariffs. Of course, Musk didn't get where he is by being cautious. But does any Tesla car have what it takes to sell in large numbers in China? Seems to me the Chinese want tiny city cars.

It seems to have decided to go for increasing manufacturing in what appears to be using an expensive (and possibly unsustainable) 24/7 running of its production line. To me it looks like the aim would be to hit the production target for a few weeks (to show it can be done) and then raise more cash to enable it to upgrade the line to allow it to hit the production target permanently. I would suggest that Tesla needs to get its production up and start making a profit before every major auto maker in the world swamps Tesla's sector of the market.

Panasonic is the battery producer and has announce it's willingness to build battery factory in Shanghai or nearby cities to supply Tesla their 18650 battery. If Panasonic have decided to build factory in China. Then it must hint Tesla will do the same. That's strong link. To build a Car and sell it in China. The Chinese government mandated every company to find a local company to start joint venture with 50-50 share each. The the chance Tesla goes alone is pretty small. -5% Now the major unknowns are not whether Tesla worried about IP or technology leaking. BMW had built its most sophisticated plant in Shenyang including the engine production and many other traditional car company do the same. It is also not Tesla doesn't like Chinese auto market which is the largest market so far and growing ferociously especially in electric vehicles. Major cities has put a bidding or lottery policy to limit the total number of gasoline cars and those cars also have been limited to go on roads during certain period of rush ours. But EV car can be bought and used without such limitation. The Chinese government put developing EV car as its national strategy and many local companies have put a lot of effort on the section. Even internet giants have invest many new startups and many of those companies get a lot of inspiration from Tesla. Tencent invest Nio and Alibaba invest Xpeng. Not to mention BYD and many other power competitors already sell EV cars in large quantities. If Tesla fail to introduce their entry level car to Chinese market on time, it will miss huge opportunity. So I believe Tesla has strong incentive to get this done ASAP. Back to Tesla, the execution track record is not good. It faced a lot of problem to launch mass production cars and for Musk, he is too busy with many other ""important"" things so he might not fully involved and push the team to accomplish the target. So I gave -20% for NO. The Chinese government may want to protect local EV companies to succeed hence increase the difficulties for Tesla to build factory in China. But on the other hand, the Shanghai local government is every efficient and willing to remove barrier for global giant companies. Check the recent opened the Starbucks Wonderland in Shanghai, that show tremendous support from local government. With mixed information i'll give another -5% NO. So the overall chance to announce is pretty high within the time frame."

Tesla is heavily indebted, running negative cashflow and not profitable currently - further expansion of investments is at risk if there is any loss of confidence by the market in the stock. High risk of a negative correction with any wider macro factors. This lowers the chances of manufacturing in China. 2. Elon Musk is a promotional CEO that regularly announces exciting initiatives / deals to propagate continued interest in the stock and keep the multiple high. This increases the chance of an announcement, however may not result in the actual construction of a manufacturing site. Given the question asks for an announcement only, I'd increase the chance based on this. 3. The base rate for Chinese regulatory reform is low due to the protection of SOE's and vested interests - this lowers the chance of manufacturing without a partner. 4. Recent talk of reform mitigates point 3. above somewhat and makes it more likely. 5. The base rate for automakers producing in China currently is higher for with a partner as that is the current regulatory environment."
