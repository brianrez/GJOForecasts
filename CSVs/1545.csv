I also modelled stochastically the turnouts, separately for each bloc (assuming them to be highest for the challenger, lowest for the incumbent).

Hernandez won in 2013 with 36.89% of the vote beating liberal parties split between 3 candidates. This election has an alliance headed by Nasralla who got 13.43% in the 2013 race running with Castro (the wife of the deposed leader in 2009) who got 28.78% in the 2013 race."
