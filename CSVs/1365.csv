Using Clark County as my canary in the coalmine. In early voting comparison on returns - 2014 it was Democrat 43,310 and GOP 42,195, which is fairly even. As of today it was Dems 32,828 GOP 23,066, which is huge difference. One must be careful to draw conclusions from early voting data, as their is a sampling bias. 1) the most Partisan voters are foaming at the mouth on day 1 at 6am waiting to vote. 2) the local get-out-the-vote effort for one party may be pushing everyone to vote early while the other party just said to vote and they will cast theirs later. However, some conclusions can be safely drawn. The Dems are more engaged, and are voting. Higher turnout for Dems and greater chances of Dem candidates, it may also provide insights into the 'undeclared' voters who are unaffiliated with a party. I will posit they will lean Dem this year, as the GOP message will not resonate as strongly in areas with migrants aren't a problem. The bigger picture for NV is unclear, as there isn't enough data for safe statistical conclusions."
