That sets his base rate at a 50% chance to qualify in a given state he submits paperwork for. He has 5 pending at the moment, putting his expected value at 7.5 states. There are also still 8 states without the deadline passed. He has applied to 17 states and missed 26 deadlines so far, putting his rate at around 40% chance he qualifies to be considered on a given ballot. So we can expect he will make around 3 of the 8 remaining deadlines, putting his expected total ballots at 9. However, there are some caveats. On August 19th, Kanye had made it onto 5 ballots and withdrawn from 3, so in just three days he has been rejected on 75% of his pending petitions, a significant uptick from his 50% rate earlier. At this rate, his expected value is closer to 7 states (below 8). Moreover, it is possible his campaign could face election fraud charges given current allegations regarding their techniques, which will make future ballots harder to qualify for and will potentially make voters more wary of errant signatures."

However, issues have been raised regarding the legitimacy of his campaigns' signature collection methods. Specifically, some have suggested his petitioners are tricking voters into signing and that some of the signatures are fake. This means that, not only could his pending requests be thrown out more frequently than previously, but West himself could face fraud charges for his campaigns controversial strategies. That being said, he still has time to make it onto the last four he needs to escape the bottom rung of the question."

However, it appears that many of his petitions are being challenged and are under review since accusations have surfaced that many of the signatures are fraudulent (one source citing 'Mickey Mouse' and 'Bernie Sanders' as two supporters) and multiple affidavits have been filed saying voters were tricked into putting their names down. Even if he was balloted on every state he has submitted a petition to so far, he still would not be on the ballot in more than 8 states and time running out for future petitions.

Of those that have already passed, he has only made it onto the ballot for four (Arkansas, Oklahoma, Illinois, and Missouri), so he would have to bat nearly 100% for the remaining states to get over 24. California's deadline ends today, and if he fails to make it then it would be mathematically impossible for him to win the White House, meaning his run may end today depending on it's purpose (substance vs. statement). West also, per reports, has support from the president and various GOP operatives, who are assisting him in collecting signatures in several purple states that could play an important role in the upcoming election. They, however, care little about deep red or blue states, as those will likely not swing no matter who he pulls votes from. However, with this backing, it is entirely possible that he will meet thresholds in more than 8 states, though it remains unlikely he will get above 17 since he would need his name on over half of the remaining ballots to hit this lower limit."
