Plus since his party holds power, they have a significant advantage that comes from that. - Will turnout be lower in a re-run? Hard to quanitfy, but my guess that it will be slightly lower turnout, but probably not as big a collapse as you would see in a western democracy like France. That shouldn't affect the results dramatically. - I think Kenyatta is a massive favorite to win again, I'd guess 80% or more. - Will Odinga challenge in the Supreme Court? Tough to say. I lean No, but this could change significantly depending on how he campaigns the re-poll. I think No because he appeared to take this challenge to the court as a result of western pressure (http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-40949265), and that pressure will be there to not challenge if he loses again. I'd say 70% likely that if Odinga loses, he doesn't challenge."
