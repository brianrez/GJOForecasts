It is kind of funny that we're not learning this from any ad-hoc ir press release by Tesla Inc. but from the media reporting about E.Musk-tweets. For their models 3 and Y, Tesla reportedly plans to replace wood elements for the front seats (doors, cockpit?), probably with plastic, and increase the price tag for its Full Self Driving (FSD) device to 14,000USD without any new capabilities or features. Due to issues and demand situation, Tesla is said to be forced to ship vehicles from Shanghai to Europe and the U.S. If you're trying to get rid of your customers: that's the way you do it. Ford's F-150 Lightning may do the rest. (Reservation: Tesla customers don't always behave like rational humans but sometimes like braindead zombies)"
