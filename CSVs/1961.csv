Indeed with the focus on Boko the rest of the country seems to be spinning out of control. In summary: https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/deconstructing-nigeria corruption Even more important the historic and geographical background. While some are skeptical of Strafor this is a great summary of the background: ""The challenges facing Nigeria date back to its foundation as a state. The country is geographically diverse: Swamps and marshes that dot the southern Niger Delta gradually transition into tropical forests and savannahs farther north, only to give way to the semi-arid climate of the Sahel. But Nigeria's population — at roughly 175 million people, the largest in Africa — is even more diverse than its landscape. The country is home to hundreds of ethnic groups, three major cultural groups (Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba and Igbo) and three major religious groups (Christianity, Islam and animism). These factors only begin to describe the many divisions in Nigerian society. The country's countless groups and subgroups, predictably, have made it incredibly difficult to govern as a single entity."

Part of this must be that killings attributed to Boko Haram are considered ongoing, hence not new. However, Fulani-related fatalities could easily surpass 1000 by the end of this year if the trend continues (177 fatalities in April alone). http://www.crisis.acleddata.com/nigeria-may-2016-update/ ""Meanwhile, significant violence has been recorded in the southeastern states of Benue and Taraba between January and April , with more recent fatalities reported in late April in Enugu (Vanguard, 26 April 2016). The perpetrators of the attacks are identified as nomadic Fulani herder militias engaging in cattle raiding against the settled farming populations of those states. There have also been reports of retaliatory violence and clashes between the Fulani militias and other communal groups (France24, 1 March 2016). The most fatal of these incidents was a series of attacks targeting Agatu communities in Benue, believed to have been carried out by Fulani militias, which killed at least 200 in late February 2016 (Vanguard, 14 February 2016). Last week, attacks attributed to Fulani militias were reported in Enugu, resulting in dozens killed after at least seven villages were attacked (IBT, 26 April 2016). These incidents represent a dramatic increase in violence in this region; violence of this type has historically been associated with the northern and central regions of Nigeria (Quartz Africa, 30 April 2016)...... In April 2016, the total fatalities reported from political violence in Benue, Enugu and Taraba (177 fatalities) overtook the fatalities reported in Borno State (164 fatalities), giving credence to the prospect that this new trend could be “the biggest security threat facing Nigeria after [Boko Haram’s] insurgency” (BBC News – Africa, 28 April 2016)."""

By the IFP definition Genocide occurred in Nigeria 50 years out of last hundred. I downgraded 2 as head of Nigerian army is begging for help and on April 14 the sit rep in ChadIan Basin out of control so UN Ambassador Powers announced a trip there now on April 14, 2015. Given Ambassador Powers proven commitment to stop Genocide and promote peace, I suspect that she will be able to discuss more than Boko with Nigerian leaders. The world Media tunnel vision is on Boko. Boko is but a symptom of regime failure and lawlessness all over Nigeria. Nigeria is too big to fail. But Nigeria is a British Colonial fiction. Since independence no authentic state with a national consensus has ever existed .See Francis Fukuyama.The Origins of Political Order (2011 Farrar Strauss Giroux ) turtles framework.. Nigeria is pre feudal and the veneer of modernization barely conceals a Hobbesian war of all against all. So Nigeria has continued lack of any real political order. Genocide as defined in IFP has been ongoing for centuries. Just counting the bodies may help get a 0.0 Brier Score. Does nothing to confront reality. Nothing Samantha Power does or any nation can do will stop this in Nigeria in next year. US and France need to come up with smart power options as no amount of US or French or British military intervention can resolve ChadIan basin.Not Cote DiVoire Sierra Leone or Burundi. There are anti corruption initiatives that UN and other actors can employ and training a New Model Nigerian Army. Not a Free Syrian army. Only sustained efforts on both fronts by UN US British France will change this anarchy. Actually the British and French General Petraeus and General Mchrystal have had some significant successes at organizing troops in tribal pre feudal societies. But if Afghanistan and Iraq teach us anything, we can't Build a Nation. We can help the current military leader and numerous Nigerian soldiers consolidate a nation and engage not kill their citizens. There are great frameworks for resolving these conflicts see for e.g. www.atlanticcouncil.org/ blogs Interview with Ambassador Khamalizad. And www.atlanticcouncil.org/publications/Rebuilding Societies. and www.un.org Millions Starving in Nigeria. Little wonder that groups like the Fulani.kill 125 a month.Starvation generates genocide."

Currently think are possible sources: Shia/Zaria - eg links from @clinton, violence in the south/south-east (Niger Delta or Biafra) - simmering and threats there since the election of Buhari. Not comfortable as low as EWP given the Zaria incident, but not sure how credible reports regarding that are."
