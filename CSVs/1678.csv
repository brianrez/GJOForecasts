If McConnell makes this happen, he's working with Democrats. Then there's the issue of what gets done before the July 31 break. It could be that working with Democrats produces 2 things: the limited fix on healthcare markets and a few other things including but not limited to the Christopher Wray confirmation before they leave on vacation. One possibility is that these things get done by the end of the month and they get to leave for vacation on time. The other possibility is that they take more time showing how hard they work and don't leave till the first few days of August in order to get these things done. The third possibility is that it all falls apart and not much new gets done. I'm having difficulty assigning odds to these possibilities but leaning towards they want to leave by the end of the month."

There's still no official announcement of a new FBI director and the leading contenders are nowhere near as qualified as Comey. Robert Mueller, the previous FBI director, who also had an impeccable resume, took a month to be confirmed after his nomination. Lieberman is a controversial figure with little FBI/investigation/justice department experience, which will make his confirmation very difficult given the Russian investigations. McCabe, another contender, has political baggage that would make his nomination filled with potential filibusters. Lastly, this White House does not have a good record with nominations. Many positions are still unfilled and many nominations took a longer than usual time to pass through the Senate."
