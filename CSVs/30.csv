The CCP also has the advantage to observe the potential risks and benefits of opening up on the Western states who have already done so, and based on their examples it is reasonable to assume that China will consider the opening safe and beneficial sometime soon. It is not in the countries interest to suffocate the tourism sector which, with domestic aviation being below 8% compared to pre-COVID years (https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2022/10/16/china-s-zero-covid-policy-a-symbol-of-xi-jinping-s-rule_6000520_4.html), is not able to survive much longer.
