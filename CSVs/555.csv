He makes the point that SpaceX consistently met timelines for getting to the ISS. I would suggest however that a civilian space flight has somewhat less priority assigned to it than a mission undertaken jointly with NASA and the immense reputational costs of failing under that scenario. That's not to say there aren't strong incentives to be first in a lucrative market. Given the SpaceX stated goal of a civilian mission no earlier than the 4th Quarter of 2021 and Virgin Galactic's recent failures, it seems SpaceX is the only company with a realistic shot. I assume a high likelihood the timeline will slip, but 1 in 4 for SpaceX seems about right."

Virgin Galactic have much less of a track record so it's harder to tell, but the one attempt they had at launching crew to space failed. Also they have not yet specified a date in 2021 so if late even if they successfully prepare, it could slip into 2022 as s result of other random factors.
