We seem to be afraid Ukraine will actually win because this will force Putin into a corner and we are afraid what Putin will do. Wrong.

Russia has performed very poorly on the battlefield, necessitating new tactics. It has struggled to knock out any major urban centres or infrastructure, whereas a nuclear strike would be relatively effective. It has demonstrated extreme brutality towards Ukrainians in occupied areas and a disdain for human life. Putin likes to escalate when things aren't going his way. He may fear for his life if the war grinds on without a quick resolution in the next 4-6 weeks, as the risk of mutinies and mass protests rises. All of these factors strongly militate towards his use of nuclear weapons against the Ukrainians."

But unlike the Cold War, where the Party and generals held sway with leaders in the USSR, Russia does not currently enjoy that luxury. Aside from North Korea, no other country in the nuclear world is almost unilaterally controlled by the psychi of one man, Vladimir Putin. He is now the character in his childhood nightmare; the cornered rat. Putin's only way out is through; there is no going back. One key indicator is the rapid pace of escalation in Ukraine. Only days into the invasion, Putin quickly escalated the conflict by indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets. He's adaptied to the reality of a weaker-than-anticipated conventional force capability. The information war against NATO is full of absurd lies and propaganda and bellicose threats of nuclear (non-conventional) war on a scale never seen. These are telegraphed punches, not hollow deterrent threats. Russian nuclear doctrine provides for limited first use of nuclear weapons and those responsible for carrying out such orders are streamlined and will be carried out. Much like climate change, Putin is not deterred by the potential catastrophic consequences. He believes he is a savior and his demonstration of unrestrained brut force will likely deter the West from responding in kind and move the crisis towards deescalation. Even if the West does respond, Putin see himself as surviver, the rat. The US and NATO are frail bunnies. Rats will survive a nuclear war, bunnies will not."

So how often do crisis such as this occur? Maybe since that survey in 2008 once before with N.Korea and now. So maybe 5 more before 2100? Then saying 20% of the 30% risk is during crisis like now, distributed over these 7 events puts it at 3%?

I believe his mind may now be broken, but that members of his entourage are partly rational - setting objectives (reconstitute USSR, commence with Ukraine), - measuring action (is it working?) - taking evasive action (escalation is an expensive option).

Most modern nuclear bombs are between 475 kilotons to 1.4 megatons). The United States no longer has a useable supply of tactical nuclear weapons, whereas the Russians have a large stockpile.

Russia has plenty of conventional military strength yet untapped in the current war against Ukraine. Therefore, any use of nuclear weapons will be limited to tactical, rather than strategic use. However, the cases where I think Russia may detonate a nuclear device outside of Russia are, 1) If losing badly in Ukraine or broader war involving NATO and a demonstration effect needs to take place to turn the tide (i.e., use a tactical weapon to demonstrate a willingness to do more if the other side doesn't give in), 2) If NATO and Russia end of in a military conflict and NATO takes the fight deep in inside Russia (e.g. St. Petersburg, Moscow, or other key cities), 3) if economic warfare against Russia reaches consequences that are unacceptable to Russia and there is no other way to stop them (again as a demo effect that more will follow). Base rate of usage is very low, but not that meaningful here. All worse case scenarios may easily NOT happen by August 5, as Russia has many options to stay afloat economically and the ground war in Ukraine can easily continue until August. I expect the conventional war to continue for a long time."

Lose Lviv and Ivaniv Fransk and Putin on NATO borders and what if he threatens nuclear war Strategic or tactical unless NATO withdraws from Estonia Poland dismantle ABM site in Poland. Etc. If Putin engages in assaulting Poland Estonia Rumania then he has crossed NATO trip wire. US should restate that it refuses to rule out first use of nuclear weapons. What if Putin repeatedly deploys what left of his army on the NATO frontier like he did with his stooge thug Lukashenko. Another build up will happen whenever Putin is stopped. Right now 200000 troops not getting job done West of Dnieper. In a country as big as Texas Putin cannot occupy entire country with 200000 troops

The only western leader he speaks to is Macron and French intelligence services see a Nato/Russia conflict as more likely than not. Not totally sure what is going on in US but apparently they are concerned about implications for Taiwan if Putin gets away with this and not ruling out pre-emptive action against Russia.
