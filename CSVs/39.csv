It looks like al-Sudani is doing surprisingly well at uniting the remaining political groups. I expect a government will be formed before 21 Feb, regardless of what Sadr does from the outside. There may well be further elections soon, but my hunch is that a majority of the Council of Representatives will approve of al-Sudani's proposed cabinet before the disunity causes things to fall apart again."
