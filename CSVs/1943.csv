Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California, said the international community had to find a way to get Pyongyang to accept a missile test moratorium. “If we do nothing, this ends in a successful flight test of the Musudan-based KN-08,” Lewis said."""

Defense Minister Han Min-koo didn’t mention THAAD deployment during his speech on Saturday, but said that South Korea “undoubtedly has the intent to deploy THAAD,” during the Q&A session. One expert said THAAD is inevitably a political and diplomatic issue regardless of the military usefulness. “The U.S. wants to expand its influence in Asia and China wants to increase its presence in the Pacific Ocean. Now the conflict in the South China Sea is expanding to the Korean Peninsula,” Kim Dong-yup, professor at Seoul’s University of North Korean Studies told NK News."""

It’s destabilizing. It’s contrary to the United Nations Security Council resolutions.” It’s this missile threat that seems to have finally convinced South Korea to ask for an American THAAD battery, supplementing shorter-range Patriot missile defense systems. (Both are US Army systems, underscoring the often-overlooked role of land power in the Pacific). Carter will meet in Singapore with his South Korean counterpart, he said, and “I’m sure that topic will come up, (but) it’s not something we need to discuss much…because the plans are moving forward.” “This is an alliance decision, a decision of the United States and the Republic of Korea which is about protecting us both from North Korean missile attack,” Carter said. “It’s an alliance decision, (and) the implementation of it will be a series of decisions that we take together.” “There are a lot of technical issues to get through,” a senior defense official elaborated — a phrasing which implies the political and strategic issue of whether to deploy THAAD is settled and now it’s just a question of how. “We will have a public announcement soon, but I’m not in a position to give you exact timing.”"

My guess is that behind the scenes there is a delicate balance between exercising the THAAD deployment and waiting to see if China is carrying through on economic sanctions against DPRK. The backdrop to all this is the complexity of the South China Sea challenges. Obama has generally shown a tendency to try to compartmentalize issues that are naturally intertwined. If China fails to live up to its sanction commitments, then there is less reason to hold off on THAAD. It also could be that the US is simply trying to dial down the overall temperature of the US_China relations, knowing that the UN Arbitration ruling is coming shortly and the chance of a military casualty is rising."

(A military fighter jet will stand in for the missile.) The exercise will focus on acquiring and sharing intelligence between the three countries “because of the limitations of the information-sharing pact,” a South Korean defense official said. South Korea, Japan and the United States signed an intelligence-gathering pact in 2014 to respond to North Korea’s growing missile threat. “To hold such drills has been decided to better defend South Korea from ever-increasing nuclear and missile threats from North Korea and detailed plans have been worked out,” the South Korean defense official said. However, the South Korean defense ministry emphasized that the drill will have ”nothing to do with any country’s missile defense program.” Incremental adjustment down."

The new man was the the negotiator for the last 6 nation disarmament talk. This might indicate that NK just wants to try to add some uncertainty to its foreign relations hoping that countries will soften the application of the agreed sanctions while they find out what the new Foreign Minister has to say. In turn this may pause any moves toward THAAD in SK. Of course linked to the likelihood of a THAAD in SK are provocative acts by NK. The last missile and nuclear tests were down played by the US and SK so presumably they do not want to increase tension. The US, Japan and SK are reported to be holding joint exercises in tracking NK missiles off Hawaii in late June. Together these reduce the likelihood of a THAAD announcement about deployment in Korea before 1 July."

But North Korea has done another test. And more than South Korea wanting to place THAAD, US would want to do it. I reckon US & South Korea will watch out for some more time and in case North Korea makes another threatening test, this will happen. The only issue is when - the timeline for this question is too short, and has very few days left (just about 2 months). I assign a high probability of around 80% of this happening in next 6-8 months. However, given shorter timeline at hand, I will reduce it by more than half. So, using 40% of 80% = 32%."

1333,2016-04-16T02:01:00Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],THAAD is an interesting solution to a poorly defined problem. The threat to South Korea is in the form of Low Trajectory Missiles and short flight submarine launched ordnance. THAAD is a defense against high trajectory and intercontinental multiple re-entry vehicle weapons transiting from earth atmosphere and space. South Korea knows this. It is Japan that would most benefit from a THAAD SYSTEM DEPLOYED ON THE Korean peninsula. I think this group is well aware of the state of relations between Korea and Japan. There are classified aspects concerning the capabilities of the system that may play into this as well.

While both President Park Geun-hye and Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung are staunch supporters of holding deliberations about THAAD deployment - which they think is the “obvious” choice - they appear to have concluded that growing controversy, including a backlash in areas where the system might be deployed, will not help in the general elections. The Minjoo Party, led by Kim Jong-in, has not clearly stated whether it supports or opposes THAAD deployment. The wait-and-see attitude that Kim has taken - he has called for a “cool assessment” of the THAAD deployment - appears related to his election strategy of not focusing on security issues. While both the Saenuri Party and the Minjoo Party made no mention of THAAD deployment in their platforms, they both promised to develop a Korea Air and Missile Defense system. People‘s Party leader Ahn Cheol-soo has responded to questions about THAAD by arguing that “a popular consensus should be achieved through public discussion.” The Justice Party is the only party with seats in the National Assembly that has expressed its opposition to deploying THAAD. During the press conference at which it announced its campaign platform, the party denounced President Park’s support for THAAD as an “arbitrary hardline response.”"

But if NK really does believe the SK current exercises are a cover for the invasion of NK it might be better to delay any announcement of THAAD until the excersises have been completed (NK may take the THAAD deployment as a step in US/SK plans to invade).

The big drawback is the Chinese do not like the idea of the THAAD in the south. The Chines do not necessarily object to the systems ability to shoot down missiles as much as they object to the radars ability to conduct surveillance on Chinese systems.

I would assume that the fact that talks (US, SK) were announced a fews days after talks took place with China about them putting pressure on NK, means that the US is suggesting that either China stops NK firing missiles or THAAD will be deployed. I assume we will only know if NK has stopped if nothing happens. If NK continues with its bad behaviour I would imagine China would be annoyed with NK and step up the pressure on NK, but SK might at that point announce that it will deploy THAAD. Who knows what NK will do, but presumably its nuclear tests and missile tests are for some reason. Usually the reason is that NK is desperate and is looking for a bribe to stop. I have no idea what bribe they are asking for or who they are asking. There could be a link with the poor harvests and it known that Russia has been supplying grain. China wants to avoid chaos in NK and so maybe a bribe of food would keep NK quiet until July."
