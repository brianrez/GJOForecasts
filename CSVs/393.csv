Liberals had 184 in 2015 when Trudeau took over for Harper but shine of being Pierre Trudeau's son and a force for Canada have worn off with a few scandels (SNC Lavelin). Currently Liberals have 35% support (8.22), while Conservatives are at 30%. Election was called 2 years early and during a rise in Delta cases, meaning the Liberals must have thought this was an advantageous time. Polling data seems to indicate a disconnect with the Liberal decision of calling an election, unless they are worried about things getting even worse. Minority governments can topple easily though and most in Canada only last 2 years. Eric Grenier puts the Liberal estimate at 160 seats and 37% Majority; 338 gives Liberals 26.4% chance of Majority. Starting at 31% (more weight to 338) and a little bump to reflect Liberals potentially knowing something since they could call election at any time."

A poll held in July, suggests that only 26% of Canadians supported the prospect of a federal election in 2021 (Autumn), 37% not happy and 34% not sure. Reports suggest that there are Liberals questioning the need for an early election (two years ahead of mandated time) considering the risk of going to the polls when they do not have to. Trudeau appears to be searching for a compelling reason (‘big ideas/ Wow factor) as to why he is seeking a third mandate in the middle of a potential fourth wave of the pandemic. The Economist magazine suggests a possible reason for holding the election in 2021 is if held in 2023, it would be more difficult to win as the voters might have tired of a scandal-prone government, a vaccine dividend would have worn off, the Conservative leader Erin O’Toole would be better known, and the administration would be entering its ninth year. A factor that will probably affect the voter turnout it is projected that up to 5 million Canadians will use mail-ballots during the fourth wave of the pandemic. Elderly voters who tend to vote more than others will be deterred by a complex mail-in application process and due to Covid, may not vote. Support for mail-in is stronger amongst New Democrats and Liberals and least popular among Conservatives. 20% of left leaning voters prefer the mail-in option that could affect the outcome of a majority desired by Trudeau."
