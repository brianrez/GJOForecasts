1333,2018-06-18T21:35:05Z,30,[0.0],[-85.0],"the Supreme Court of the United States issued rulings in Gill v. Whitford and Benisek v. Lamone, two partisan gerrymandering challenges. In neither of these rulings did the court directly address whether a district map can be struck down as unconstitutional for giving one political party advantage over another. Instead, today's rulings were made on standing grounds (as in Gill) or procedural grounds (as in Benisek). Gill v. Whitford: The court ruled unanimously that the plaintiffs — 12 Wisconsin Democrats who alleged that Wisconsin's state legislative district plan had been subject to an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments — had failed to demonstrate standing to bring a complaint under Article III of the United States Constitution. Chief Justice John Roberts penned the majority opinion, in which Associate Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan joined. Kagan filed a concurrence, which was joined by Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor. Associate Justice Clarence Thomas filed an opinion, joined by Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch, that concurred in part with the majority opinion and the court's judgment. Roberts noted that the court's opinion did not address the question of whether partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable: In cases where a plaintiff fails to demonstrate Article III standing, we usually direct the dismissal of the plaintiff's claims. This is not the usual case. It concerns an unsettled kind of claim this Court has not agreed upon, the contours and justiciability of which are unresolved. ... We therefore remand the case to the District Court so that the plaintiffs may have an opportunity to prove concrete and particularized injuries using evidence—unlike the bulk of the evidence presented thus far—that would tend to demonstrate a burden on their individual voters. We express no views on the merits of the plaintiffs' case."

Indeed, the drafters had drawn other statewide maps that, their own analysis showed, would secure fewer Republican seats.409 Finally, adopting a different statewide districting map, perhaps one of those earlier maps or a map as proposed in Professor Mayer’s Demonstration Plan, would redress the constitutional violation by removing the state-imposed impediment on Democratic voters."""

Thus in Wisconsin, gerrymandering produced the following results in state elections: 2012: Republicans took 48% of the vote, received 60 out of 90 seats; 2014: republicans won 52% of the popular vote, won 63 of 99 seats.

And the SC did take this case on -- they could have passed and let it stand. The fact that the District court brought in outside matters after the trial seems like it ought to matter also, but it does not seem to. Also, Kennedy wants to try to fix this problem but did not seem to find a solution in this trial. So I think it still remains as it is. There is, of course, Stari Decisis as well. This all tends to make the question mostly ""No"". How much? The District Court said Yes -- but the SC heard the case, this says ""Maybe"" -- 50-50. Questions make it seem that the court will go to ""No"" - now 75%. Kennedy wants a fix, but did not seem to find one. No change. Stare Decisis - 80% No. But the reverse is 20% so answer is 20% on the overall question. BUT -- there is this nagging ""any part"" bit. There could easily be a split type of decision like before.

SCOTUS does not want the federal courts to in effect become the arbiters of which party in effect controls which state. It would only further turn the Judiciary into a political branch picking winners and losers in what party controls the state delegations based upon conjecture and non-proven methods and results as was the basis for the district court ruling. This is an issue best left handled by state legislatures and voters as the political branch. This should be left to state voters via referendum and/or legislatures through whatever state constitutional amending process to deal with the issue as they see fit. Given the practice dates to the time of the Founding Fathers and they saw no role for the Federal government to intervene is clear that they intended for this issue to remain within the purview of the states and their voters within. There is already a severe imbalance of power in the United States held by un-elected, robed individuals overruling the will of voters as if they were oligarchs or gods. The last thing this nation needs is the federal judiciary becoming the arbiter of elections and political processes rather than the voters. There is no republic, nor democracy when a few, select, politically appointed (un-elected) individuals and/or a tiny minority of less than 20 be-robed citizens can wrest control of the political process from their duly elected representatives. There is a political process that address this at the federal level as well. It is called Article V of the United States Constitution. It is far past time for un-elected, political appointees to stop bypassing Article V simply because they believe it to be for a good cause and too hard to pass. It was intended that way for a reason, not the least of which was to prevent tyranny - be it by a majority or a minority."

Under a non-partisan lens, partisan gerrymander violates First Amendment and dilutes votes. And Roberts held money to be speech under First A. Citizens United And there is a moderate approach. Compare: Linda Greenhouse ""I can only guess that Chief Justice Roberts, if he was tempted for a split second to view this little case as the dissent saw it, recoiled from Justice Gorsuch’s superheated language. What boundaries remain, indeed? My sense is that the chief justice reads this heavily freighted political moment as a time to avoid spending the Supreme Court’s limited capital needlessly, in contrast to his junior colleague’s evident desire to make as much noise as he can. Maybe I’m wrong about that. But there’s a cliché in journalism that it takes three to make a trend, and I’ve counted to three in just the past three weeks. If I’m right, there’s a realignment, however subtle, in progress at the court now that portends a future more hopeful, or at least more interesting, than appeared likely even a few months ago"" I am going back on all these seems balls in Roberts, Kennedy,and Brier court and there is real institutional interest in Court not appear to be partisan especially now."

But when it comes to cases involving reapportionment—challenges to how states draw lines for congressional or state legislative elections—the justices can’t be quite so choosy. Congress has chipped away at the cases subject to mandatory review by the Supreme Court, but it has kept it for redistricting cases where an election looms and time is of the essence. If skewed electoral maps may need to be redrawn, a special three-judge federal court is convened to hear the case; an appeal goes right to the Supreme Court, bypassing America’s 13 circuit courts."

It appears to have a few holes in determining the true level of ""partisan meddling"" on a district by district basis, as obviously both parties attack different districts with different intensities based on their chances of winning them.

11282,2017-12-19T22:26:39Z,1,[55.0],[55.0],"Based on the news from this case's oral briefings, it seems highly likely that the outcome of this case will come down to the vote of Justice Kennedy. In Vieth v. Jubelirer, Kennedy voted with the majority that partisan gerrymandering claims were non-justiciable because there was no discernible and manageable standard for ""adjudicating political gerrymandering claims."" He did however, acknowledge that judicially manageable standards for gerrymandering could be developed in future that would allow the court to rule on cases of political gerrymandering. The standard being argued for by the defense is what's known as the ""efficiency gap""--a recently-developed metric that counts number of votes “wasted” in each election, either because they are cast for the losing candidate or because the victorious candidate did not need them to win. Will Kennedy conclude that this metric is sufficient? It's though to say. But given that he voted for the stay during oral arguments, I am going to give a slight edge towards ""Yes."""
42566,2017-12-19T22:00:11Z,1,[70.0],[70.0],"The lower court ruled 2-1 that the plan was unconstitutional. This court is made up of 3 judges appointed by Democratic presidents. Since the gerrymandering being investigated was in favor of republicans, it is not unlikely that the lower court found the gerrymandering unconstitutional. The Supreme Court is controlled (5-4) by conservative appointees. Given the US Supreme Court make-up (if party indicates how the vote will turn out), there is still a reasonable possibility that the court would overturn the lower court. However, ""any part of Wisconsin's redistricting plan"" is broad enough that I am forecasting that the likelihood is high that some portion of the plan could be ruled unconstitutional. The oral hearing seemed to indicate agreement with the lower court. The Supreme Court is motivated to get this ""right"" to set a precedent for future elections."

Most justices seem to agree that Wisconsin's legislative districts do not accurate reflect how its population is distributed. At issue is (1) if the SCOTUS should intervene to ensure a level playing field and prevent disenfranchisement of voters, (2) is there a manageable way to apply some standard to assess when this extreme gerrymandering occurs (Justice Alito)? Justice Breyer suggested a possible, workable compromise: that such a test would only be applied when there is one-party control of the government, and that courts should act only when the redistricting creates an ""extreme outlier"" when compared to other maps. In this case, the number of opportunities would be limited - once a decade, perhaps - and only if extreme (thereby allowing the SCOTUS to avoid having to decide on the validity of social science analysis and send it back to the lower courts to decide)."

Since then a new measure called the Efficiency Gap (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/03/upshot/how-the-new-math-of-gerrymandering-works-supreme-court.html) has been put forward. Along with this such developments as Big Data, Machine Learning, and the effect of Social Media on the recent election may have made the SC more open to such algorithms, at least their predictive power if not prescriptive value. So, regardless of the SC makeup (read Gorsuch and friends), algorithmic arguments may carry more weight this time around"

So the whole question hinges on what arguments would be convincing the Kennedy. That's a lot of uncertainty. But, consider the right wing of the court's attacking of the efficiency gap standard and other metrics as subjective in their implementation. Consider too that Breyer's standard is not necessarily universally accepted by the court. It's not bad logically, but other Kennedy would have to agree with that standard to avoid the problem of 1/3 of all districts having standing to bring a case of partisan gerrymandering before the supreme court. Would Kennedy both 1) adopt the Breyer and 2) disagree that the efficiency gap (and other measures) is/are subjective? That's a high bar. Still, it assumes the internal dialogue of one person subject to all their individual differences. It's just too hard to call this one in any overly definitive way.

In fact, a state in a recent case about raced based gerrymandering (violations of the voting rights act) defended itself by saying their map had nothing to do with race despite that black and brown people were packed all into one district. No, it wasn't race, it was just partisan gerrymandering. They argued that it just so happens black and brown people tend to vote democrat. That was the state’s defense! And that’s because partisan gerrymandering) while distasteful is allowed. As technology advances, the Supreme Court cannot ignore it’s impact and throw its hands in the air, but will need to modernize its thinking. I don’t think this is lost on Kennedy who said in a case 2 years ago that gerrymandering goes against democratic principles."

First, four Justices: Roberts, Alito, Gorsuch and Thomas counter balance the other four justices: Breyer, Ginsburg, Kagan and Sotomayor. Again, justice Kennedy would be the deciding vote, as he did in Vieth case. The questions asked by justice Kennedy left me believe he will keep the same position he had in Vieth case: a concurring opinion with the plurality. The reason why it is still a 1/8th chance instead of 0: Justice Kennedy may find that it is unconstitutional based on First Amendment right, since the Court already decided that gerrymandering under Equal Protection clause is constitutional, and he may find justice Breyer's method is workable."

The ruling put the authority to gerrymander and decide on state districting maps within the realm of state lawmakers."

I also figured that's likely why he's not retiring yet. McCain and other Republicans have submitted amicus briefs along with lots of groups. I figured Kennedy wanted to be somewhat of a hero here as he gets close to retirement contemplating his legacy.

35831,2017-10-01T04:13:23Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"The Supreme Court decided to hear the case, instead of letting the lower court's decision stand. This requires 4 votes, presumably in disagreement with the lower court. Although it doesn't mean the same four justices will vote to reverse the lower court, there is good chance that the four justices will do that. The Court also put an injunction on the lower court request to redraw the map immediately, This requires 5 justices. If one has to bet, one should bet that Justice Kennedy will be the deciding vote. In prior case, Vieth v. Junelirer, Justice Kennedy agreed that there is no standard for drawing a political map, but left door open for further review. This case is the further review. Therefore, the chance that the court will agree with lower court (a yes in this forecast) is hinged on Justice Kennedy found that there is a new method to redistricting which the state of Wisconsin didn't follow. Since American politics is as messy now as when Vieth v. Junelirer was heard, I doubt that Justice Kennedy will suddenly find a new method. Although it is hard to read the mind of the justices, I must bet that the court will maintain similar stance as in Vieth v. Junelirer. My opening bid is 0%. Will revise the forecast after the Oral Argument, scheduled Oct 3rd."

S 237 (U.S. Apr. 28, 2004) the plurality suggests there is no place for the First Amendment in this area. See ante, at ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 568. The implication [*315] is that under the First Amendment any and all consideration of political interests in an apportionment would be invalid. Ibid. [****94] (""Only an equal protection claim is before us in the present case--perhaps for the very good reason that a First Amendment claim, if it were sustained, would render unlawful all consideration of political affiliation in districting""). That misrepresents the First Amendment analysis. The inquiry is not whether political classifications were used. The inquiry instead is whether political classifications were used to burden a group's representational rights. If a court were to find that a State did impose burdens and restrictions on groups or persons by reason of their views, there would likely be a First Amendment violation, unless the State shows some compelling interest. Of course, all this depends first on courts' having available a manageable standard by which to measure the effect of the apportionment and so to conclude that [**1798] the State did impose a burden or restriction on the rights of a party's voters."

2965,2017-09-03T17:59:42Z,2,[80.0],[0.0],I think Kennedy wants it as a first amendment case. He has 4 liberals and 2 extremely great justices C.J.Roberts in on this or not blocking. After Citizens United he needs to not have a fractured court. Goresuch will have his First Amendment gut check. On Texas v U S could settle out.DAPA is gone anyway..moot. DACA is settling out. See Ryan. So this big big case of term.

So it could be all 5 or even six Gorsuch is strong First A then its 6 then Roberts joins in an special concurrence makes 7 and Thomas and Alito are out in the cold!
15922,2017-09-01T17:55:16Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],"Yes: 4 Liberals are definite votes for Yes. Kennedy is a lean yes. Of the 4 Conservatives, only Alito and Thomas are definite Nos. Gorsuch could be a surprise if he decides to assert his independence, but will likely stay No. Roberts seems to have an independence streak and an eye on his place in history. He's always a risk to vote unexpectedly. This new ""Efficiency Gap"" measure seems to answer the questions raised the last time the SC considered this."
