In this case this question becomes 1) UK revokes Article 50, pure and simple, 2016 referendum IS NOT honored. 2) The May deal is enacted, UK leaves the EU with a deal. 3) May deal fails leading to no deal Brexit, aka known as hard Brexit or crashing out of EU. 4) May deal fails and both UK and EU agree to a second extension not contingent on May deal. (This option may not be accounted for depending on criteria for what constitutes an extension.) 4) Hybrid approach, which is my preference and a likely outcome. May Deal is not considered or fails to pass. An emergency EU summit in which a new extension date, with different or no caveats for UK qualifying for extension is proposed, approved by EU, and this date is presented to Parliament which agrees AND ALSO agrees internally as to a plan forward that bypasses the May deal. This may require revocation to avoid unintended hard Brexit aka crash out, but with an internal agreement that Article 50 be invoked again after one or more of the following: 1) EU election is held and UK contingent is seated. 3) New UK snap election after 14 April. 2) New referendum. ( Mathematically, there is a fair way to do this by splitting the question AND asking a separate, new multiple choice question for type of Brexit v remain. Using weighted scores and using the higher of the first referendum leave vote or the second in weighting, it is possible to both give Brexit and remain an opportunity to prevail, while also providing Brexiteers the opportunity to both confirm their leave vote without risk AND give direction to the Government and Parliament to proceed towards a Hard Brexit, May's deal (which the EU has agreed to accept) or start over by writing new, different Article 50 invocation law which includes indications from the People and Parliament to guide the Government's UK negotiators toward a deal that is more likely to pass Parliament. And it avoids Brexiteers having the first referendum stolen by asking only a question that pits multiple forms of Brexit against one simple remain choice, which would guarantee failure for Brexit."

One indicative of the question resolving by UK Parliament ratification of the extension, rather than it having resolved by UK requesting and receiving an extension which May claims that international law provided an extension upon EU vote. In which case this question HAS resolved. If on the other hand, if one holds that UK Parliament must now vote to extend the deadline and that the Macron/EU caveat that the 14 April extension date is contingent on the May deal be enacted by Parliament, then our greatest fear, an accidental crash out due to running out the clock resulting from ridgity and the application of a single binary approach to proposition before Parliament that has 3 or more possible outcomes. In other words May has to reach 50% on a question that at least 2 other major factions have separate & opposing motives to vote no on. The approach should have been splitting the question and entertaining indicative votes at the time of legislating the vote to invoke Article 50, an approach neither well suited to the UK parliamentary procedure nor Mrs May's character."

The UK Parliament has to approve or not the above-citedagreement: if it passes, the new deadline would be on the 22nd of May, increasing the possibility of implementing a new deal; if it fails the parliament has to choose between an extension till the 12 April or no extension, generating chaos about the siituation on the 29th of March. I think that the UK will take time to decide what to do, for sure until the 12 April and very likely also over the 22 of May. In both case, the UK would try to understand what to do, for example asking for further extension and negotiations, postponing that to very late 2019. They could also reconsider the option of a new referendum (we should remember there is a petition of more than 5 millions people to discourage Brexit), but again during this new extension period, and for sure not on the 29th of March, for the reasons I explained in my previous forecast. From the EU point of view, I think they neither have advantages from a no deal and would prefer to let the UK fix its domestic policy and decide how to procede: they agreed for the two possible extensions (12 april and 22 May), and I think they could go further. Indeed, even if it would be complicated and triggering including the UK in the European elections, the EU would prefer this option rather than a no deal."

The EU granted the three weeks extension on the condition that the UK needs to pass her Brexit deal on a third attempt. If the MPs approve May's deal, the EU will then extend the Brexit deadline further to the 22nd of May, thus giving the UK time to pass the required domestic legislation. The EU Parliament must also ratify the deal, but that’s expected to be mostly a formality. Because May was forced to ask for a delay in the deadline, there is a good chance that Brexit will be even further delayed. The delay creates a precedent, which is the reason why I give it an optimistic 35% likelihood. In this case of events, the Prime Minister comes up with a new plan in 3 weeks' time to move past the political paralysis which is already causing exasperation among other European leaders. However, the Parliament rejected May's plan by 230 votes in January and by 150 votes the second time, which is a massive margin to make up. It is still looking very likely that the Parliament will defeat the proposal once again."

The only way that the UK could now leave the EU on 29th would be via a crash out ""no deal"", which MPs will be allow. A50 could be revoked to avoid a crash out and revoking would happening if the European Council refuses an extension. However the UK has asked for a ""short extension"" until 30th June and Tusk has said he would recommend a ""short extension"" if the UK parliament voted for the WA (Withdrawal Agreement that May has already agreed with the EU). it might only be until 22nd May rather than the 30th June (i.e before the EU elections, rather than May's date of before the new EU parliament sits) What Tusk did not say today was, what would happen if the UK parliament did not vote for the WA before 29th March. The reason for not saying now is probably that Mrs May has only asked for a ""short extension"" and the only reason was wanting it that she gave in her letter to Tusk, was to have another to get her WA passed by parliament. It is almost certain that if the UK parliament does not vote for the WA before the 29th March (and unless Mrs May can convince the Speaker that the WA is in some significant way different to the WA that parliament voted down last week, he will not allow Mrs May to even put it to parliament) Mrs May would need to do what she had previously said she was going to do, and sentdTusk another request to extend A50 for a period long enough to change the WA, and explain her plan for getting the WA changed (by a change of PM, a general election or referendum for example). Tusk did not say that he had ruled this option out. In my opinion putting pressure on MP to vote for May's WA in order to get an A50 extension will have little effect because may Conservative and DUP MPs say they would be happy to crash out of the EU, so they (say) that crashing out on 29th Match is better than May's WA."

The last scenario (Neither of the above will occur and the UK will leave the EU) comprehends both the possibility of a no deal Brexit and the possibility that the UK leaves the EU in the exact date given by the 2-years deadline set by Article 50. Both of these possible outcomes should be seriously taken into account, as Theresa May is facing major problems in making the Parliament accept the draft deal with the EU - rejected few days ago, https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47547887 - , and her journeys to find new deal could be not enough. On the other side, if the UK will find a last minute plan to proceed with the Brexit, the EU states claimed to be willing to extend the deadline (https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/20/brexit-latest-news-letter-article-50-extension-pmqs-theresa-may-bends-to-pressure-from-tory-brexiters-and-rules-out-asking-for-long-article-extension-politics-live). Basically, the final outcome will depend on the next 9 days' May's ability to find a Brexit plan sustainable for the Parliament. I out a higher probability to the second scenario - extension - because I think the Parliament, the Government and the Prime Minister will find an agreement in the next days rather than to risk a no deal.

Because of that and the interest of the European Union to avoid a hard Brexit, the forecast at hand adapts its prediction towards a highly likely Extension of the negotiations - as of 85%. A 10% likelihood of a no deal Brexit is estimated to be left due to the fact that all member states have to agree upon the extension. A 5% chance that Brexit got stopped by the UK itself is estimated to be left due to the high degree of uncertainty around the issue, which is why self-critically no scenario should be excluded at this point of time."

The Speaker has just ruled that under a 400 year old rule Mrs May is not allowed to bring her EU Withdrawal Agreement motion back for a 3rd try to pass it unless it is substantially different to the one voted down last week. He has ruled that there were changes between the try in January and the try last week. The Solicitor General has said that Parliament may need to be prorogued to allow the motion to be reintroduced. (You can vote on the same thing in different sessions.) Clearly these action are against the spirit of the rules parliament, and show what a mess its in if these sorts of measures are being taken. Normal convention is that if a PM loses an important vote they resign. Its unprecedented for a PM to lose a vote by as much as Mrs May has done not to resign. Its obviously unprecedented for a PM to lose what is in effect two votes for the same thing to not resign. As far as I know no PM has ever tried to tried get around the rules by proroguing parliament (since 1948). This sort of behavour is not supposed to happen in the UK parliament. So whatever the outcome of this particular vote Mrs May will go down in history as the person who wrecked the traditional way of parliamentary behavior. The question is will any of this work for Mrs May? The current thinking is that even if May gets her WA motion voted on again, and even if the DUP suddenly decides that Mrs May deal is just what they always wanted and vote for it (any extra money for NI would, I am sure, not influence them at all) and some of ERG (hard Brexiteers) who it now seems don't really have any of their own principals, they will just follow what ever the DUP does, also vote for May's deal, Mrs May would probable still not get her deal through. Why would it get voted through? Brexiteers and Remainers are all agreed its a very bad deal, and Mrs May herself said ""no deal is better than a bad deal"", and hers is certainly a bad deal. Of course May could now threaten to just prorogue parliament until April so that it cannot change the A50 leaving date. That would set the constitution on fire! Its still almost 100% certain that A50 will be extended."

This gives twofold opportunity for the politicians in power to promote the opinion of revoking Article 50, which would mean stopping Brexit in full. According to the European Court of Justice the decision to revoke Article 50 must be “unequivocal and unconditional”, contrary to its imposition. It seems to me that the chances to be revoked before 30th March, although possible, are relatively low. First, because it is 15th March already and in the Parliament talks about extension of the transition has already started following uncertain trade deal between UK and EU. The decision to revoke Article 50 needs to be unambiguious, which is not possible in the unearthed political situation in the UK, therefore in my view, I see a very high possibility and likelihood of prolonging the process of leaving for the UK due to the unsettled trade deal and the rest of business relations between the UK and EU. While I cannot claim certainty over what will occur in the future two weeks, it seems very unlikely for the last answer- neither a decisions to revoke, nor an extension, because this would leave the UK in a regulatory misbehavior in relation to the EU and it will further weaken its political power."

Revocation would require getting the UK public to agree by having a general election or referendum but there is not sufficient time to have a referendum between now and 29th March as estimates say that a referendum would take a minimum of 22 weeks. This seems near impossible. Extension of A50 seems most likely. Opposition to Theresa May's deal has been softening, hers is the only Brexit deal on the table, and some MPs who originally voted against her deal are now scrambling as options are limited in the shrinking amount of time and MPs are shifting to support the PM. This is best seen in how hard Brexiters have begun conceding or seemingly supporting different aspects of the deal. Most notable is the apparent commitment of MPs to the backstop which would maintain Ireland's open border (a political loophole for previous members of May's opposition to shift their stance). Why is this important? If Theresa May gets more support then the prospect of a hard Brexit is less likely. The Guardian states that ""even if May were to get her deal through in mid-March, she would still need to delay Brexit beyond 29 March in order to pass the necessary legislation."" This means that Brexit would need to be extended. Theresa May does still face an enormous opposition however, and the possibility of the UK leaving the EU before March 30 would most likely be due to a ""no deal"" Brexit. A possibility that has been weaponized politically as a worst case scenario. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bIbZIYCG2o https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-46481643 https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/03/mays-hopes-rise-as-senior-tory-mps-soften-opposition-to-brexit-deal https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/what-is-article-50-the-only-explanation-you-need-to-read/"

Finally if another vote of no confidence is called and succeeds, then there would too little time to form another another and to shuffle around the leadership and March 29th would probably come up before the new government is settled.

This holds true even after Corbyn and thus Labour’s latest repositioning in favor of a second referendum (https://www.politico.eu/article/jeremy-corbyn-brexit-labour-backs-second-brexit-vote-to-stop-theresa-may-deal/). The dominance of Brexit supporters, both radical and moderate in the conservative party will prevent any withdrawal attempts on the part of the Conservatives. The same applies to May’s conservative government. Her Brexit course and categorical denial to revoke the Brexit so far, as well as the fact that her political survival depends on the further implementation of the Brexit speaks for itself. Even if Labour could assert itself with its idea of a second referendum, polls haven’t changed since Brexit (https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45098550). Even if a majority would vote in favor of remaining in the EU, the win would be most likely narrow and the referendum’s legitimacy would be highly contested.

However, since the question is focused on what might happen from now to March 30, I see the revoke option as very unlikely. Unless extraordinary changes or a black swan in the English political environment happened (the reason why I maintained a 1% possibility), considering the course of events there is no time to activate such option. In fact, the UK in order to not undermine the stability of its common low creating a dangerous precedent could opt for revoking only after a new referendum (which, as a matter of fact, the “remain” would be likely to win). However, since with the conservative party is in power this will never happen (as Theresa May has reiterated more than once). This scenario would be possible (not certain) only after new elections, the labor party in power and with their willingness to call for a new Referendum. Hence, even though such a complex scenario might unfold in the coming months, there wouldn’t be enough time to ask directly to revoke Article 50, the UK would have to ask for an extension and, only after that, start an internal discussion which might bring to a legitimization of a new referendum."

Aside from that, I have more or less switched the ""extension"" vs ""leave on time"" probabilities, with some slight adjustment in each. Talks have not necessarily progressed between May and EU leadership, but they have and will continue to occur, which shows that each side is desirous of a solution. Additionally, Labour is starting to play more reasonably, and there are talks of a de facto Backstop plan that the EU should find more palatable. Thus, I think the probability of an on-time departure is more likely than before, still giving some weight however to an extension, as whatever is agreed upon will take time to implement."

Though the EU has done their best to punish the UK for its decision throughout this entire process, ultimately their economies are too intertwined, which means they will likely grow slightly more lenient as the deadline approaches. I think it is most likely that they will come close to a deal as the deadline approaches, but grant an extension in order to finalize details and put a plan in place for execution.

Extending Article 50 requires both UK and EU approval. The EU sees the Brexit issue as a UK problem, and has been uncooperative in finding a resolution. They are also unlikely to approve an extension unless they see a real tangible plan and not more of the “same ole, same ole.” Because a referendum is unlikely, the EU is not helping the UK work out its own domestic problems, and that a “no deal” will be disastrous to UK, the government will come together to make a deal happen, even if it’s a bad deal. Justifications below: May says Europe unlikely to extend Article 50; also says to do so would just prolong the Decision. In regards to another referendum, May and other parliamentarians (including some opposed to Brexit) say that a new referendum breaks down society’s confidence in the government and “shatter faith in democracy” – the people voted, and you should do a re-vote because the outcome is difficult. This leads me to believe that the government won’t allow a second referendum. However, a new referendum could be used as a last resort after all other options are exhausted. This is risky too because what if the new referendum results say “Yes, we the people still want Brexit?” and leaders have to consider that a referendum may not give them the answer they want. Let the clock wind down until 29 March could cause huge economic uncertainty for the British; however next meaningful vote won’t be until early Feb. Brussels says this is London’s decision, and they’re hands off. Based on news since the Brexit vote, the EU has never been happy about the Brexit decision, and have seemed uncooperative in helping London get to a decision, making it seem unlikely that the EU would approved an Article 50 extension, even if that’s what the UK wants. And an extension would require consent from all 27 member countries – 100% consensus on any issue is never easy. But yet, Yvette Cooper, the chairwoman of the home affairs select committee, is planning to put down a tightly worded amendment to give time for a bill that would give parliament the power to support an extension of article 50. Despite one of the worst defeats in Parliamentary history (voting down the Brexit deal), May survived a no-confidence vote. To me this implies the government wants to get to a solution – working out a new government would be devastating in Brexit process. Even the Britishers that don’t agree with May on her Brexit plans admire her grit and determination."

Furthermore, with even conservative leaders such as Nigel Farage favoring a second referendum to a no deal Brexit, leaving with no deal appears to be a plausible outcome but suits very few key decisionmakers' interests, even on the right.

The four groups being; Hard Brexiteer (Conservatives), Hard Remain (Conservatives), Conservatives who are not happy that the ""deal"" contains no legally blinding framework for a Future Trade Deal (its only a Withdrawal Agreement), and the DUP. It seems very unlikely that the government would get sufficient opposition MPs to vote for May's Deal to get it passed. Its extremely unlikely that the parliament would allow the UK to just fall out of the EU with No Deal. Therefore that leaves the possibilities of stopping Brexit by revoking A50 or extending it. Revoking A50 is technically the easiest option because it does not require the EU to agree to it, it just needs the UK parliament to vote to Revoke. However Revoking A50 is politically much more difficult without parliament giving itself political cover by getting the UK public to agree by having a general election or referendum. There is not sufficient time to have a referendum between now and 29th March, (it has been calculated that a referendum would take a minimum of 22 weeks) and even if there was time to hold the actual referendum some time after the referendum and before 29th March would be required to take any actions that were necessary after the result was known (if the result of a referendum was that the Brexit process should continue but not with May's Deal then A50 would need to be extended to allow for more negotiations.) Its possible that a General Election could take place, but assuming that it did, it almost certain that the Prime Minister would either be May or Corbyn. If it were May then nothing much would have changed. If it were Corbyn and he wanted to negotiate a different Brexit deal there would not be time to do it before 29th March (assume no General Election could be called before the second half of January, which would give Corbyn about 4 weeks to negotiate a deal with the EU and get it approved. That seems almost impossible. The only possible deal I could see being done in that time would be to take May's Withdrawal Agreement, remove the Irish Backstop and replace it with a legally enforceable agreement that the UK will remain in the EEA and the Customs Union and will continue to contribute and obey EU rules and ECJ (i.e Norway+ Brexit). So extending A50 is by far the likely outcome. My interpretation of MPs comments and polling results (particularly the recent YouGov polls as interpreted by Peter Kellner) is that many Leave voters and most Brexit supporting MPs are losing confidence that any Brexit that resembles the version promised before the June 2016 referendum will ever be possible. Brexit was sold as having cake (a frictionless trade relationship with the EU) and eating it (being able to do FTAs with 3rd countries, without allowing EU citizen Freedom of Movement, without paying subs to the EU, and without having to follow the ECJ rulings). After two and half years of the EU telling the UK that to have frictionless trade you have to be a member of the EU (or EEA+ Single Market), which requires that you abide by EU rules including the Four Freedoms, pay contributions and follow rulling of the ECJ, even the Brexiteers are starting to realise the EU is not kidding. And most of the Brexiteers know full well that without frictionless trade much of the UK's manufacturing industry (the part that depends on trans-European supply chains) would migrate into the remaining EA (that's a much bigger market than the UK). While the Brexiteers favorite economist says that losing manufacturing is not a problem and that the UK could adjust, the Brexiteers are wondering how long it would take for this adjustment to happen (towns that lost their heavy manufacturing in the 1980s are still depressed now) and how the Leave voters will feel when they lose their jobs and are told to adjust. Leave voters are, I think, seeing that Brexit might be a great idea and a poke in the eye to the liberal elite, but the people that are likely be worse off are the left behind in the industrial towns, and maybe the elite (in the shape of the toffs who told them to vote Leave) have screwed them again. No one wants to admit they were wrong, so I think the Leave voters and the Brexiteer MPs are desperately hoping that someone else will stop Brexit, so they don't have have admit they were wrong voting to Leave. If someone else stops Brexit then the Brexiteers (and Leave voters) will be able to say that Brexit would have been a wonderful thing if only traitors had not stopped them getting the deal they imagined."

It is so risky an action for the UK executive to undertake that it is politically impossible. It would almost certainly require a parliamentary vote and would cause a constitutional crisis. Only pro-EU extremists would do this - and they are too far from political power to do so.

Exending Art. 50 would be very difficult and would split, and severely weaken, governing Conservative Party. Current political dynamics and preparations be EU and UK government make extension of current arrangements after UK formally leaves and continuing negotiations much more likely if no WA ratified by UK Parliament. A vote in Parliament would almost certainly be required to extend Article 50.

For the purpose of this question though, I would see some other scenarios how the Brexit date will remain at the end of March, regardless of whether May will be around as PM by then. This could be for example the UK asking the EU for an extension but the EU refusing. So I bumped the third bucket up a bit to come in at 45%. I see a revoke as highly unlikely so put that at 5%. By exclusion, that leaves 50% for an extension agreed upon between UK and EU."
