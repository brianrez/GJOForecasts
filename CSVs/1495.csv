If there was to be a second referendum it would be more likely to be called at the point when it becomes clear that Brexit as described my Mrs May will not be possible (e.g.Mrs May has described Brexit as being outside the Single Market and Customs Union, not under the ECJ, no significant annual payments, with no Freedom of Movement, but with no physical border between NI and Eire, and no different between NI and the rest of the UK, and with a friction less free trade trade deal with the EU (equivalence but not identical standards) which at the same time allows the UK to strike free trade deal with 3rd countries - otherwise known as ""having your Brexit cake and eating it""). If (when?) it become clear that this deal will not happen some way out of will be needed. There are three possibilities; the government will decide, parliament will decide or a new referendum will have to be held. I think the most likely outcome will be for parliament to decide. For the government to decide would require it to admit that it had been misleading everyone by suggesting that the Mrs version was ever possible. Having another referendum would risk getting the ""wrong answer"" (e.g. the public voting for an outcome that the government and parliament does not want). So my view is that the most likely outcome would be to ""allow"" MPs to have a vote on the Brexit outcome so MP can be blamed for the outcome not being what anyone actually wanted."
