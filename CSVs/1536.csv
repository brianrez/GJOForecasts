In September, Qatar inaugurated the US$7.4 billion Hamad seaport, thereby securing alternative trading routes. Investor confidence in the currency peg remains anchored by the country’s large stock of liquid external assets worth nearly US$180 billion (of a total stock of close to US$300 billion), which have helped to contain the increase in risk premiums on sovereign and corporate debt. The hydrocarbon sector, which constitutes 80 percent of export earnings and 90 percent of government revenues, has been largely unaffected.
