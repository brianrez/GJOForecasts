"Before 18 October 2016, will there be a confrontation involving Iran's and another country's national military forces that produces at least one fatality in the Persian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz, or the Gulf of Oman?",2016-08-02T17:00:40Z,2016-10-17T17:00:58Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']","['Foreign Policy', 'Security and Conflict']",658,654,275,237,"This question was closed on option B) 'No' on 17 October, 2016. There have been no reports of fatal confrontation between Iranian military forces and other national military forces in the Persian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz, or the Gulf of Oman during the time frame in question. For the purposes of this question, Iran's national military forces include the Revolutionary Guard Corps (US Institute of Peace, Council on Foreign Relations). Iranian vessels patrolling the Strait of Hormuz have been involved in what the US and others have called a number of risky interactions in recent years (Reuters, United Press International, NY Times, ABC News). For this question, civilians killed inadvertently will be included in the fatality count. Recommended Questions Will any disputes over IAEA access to Iranian sites be referred to the Joint Commission before 1 July 2017? Will either Mir Hossein Mousavi or Mehdi Karroubi stand trial or be released from house arrest before 1 June 2017? Will there be a lethal confrontation in the South or East China Sea region involving China's and another country's national military forces or law enforcement personnel before 1 January 2017?",https://www.gjopen.com/questions/252-before-18-october-2016-will-there-be-a-confrontation-involving-iran-s-and-another-country-s-national-military-forces-that-produces-at-least-one-fatality-in-the-persian-gulf-the-strait-of-hormuz-or-the-gulf-of-oman
