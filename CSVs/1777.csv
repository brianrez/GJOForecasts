Although in Trump's case, the 100 days has pretty much been all about him the whole time. I don't think the tax cut for corporations is going to help even if people believe what he promises anymore.

It seems likely as April 28 is a scant four days away that Trump likely ends up ""between the 15's."" His net approval rating average for the month of April is -12.9, (overall it's -7.9) so while close to the Below - 15 threshold its not quite there. The 3 days he was below -15 in April were the first three days of the month. With that said its not a slam-dunk if his approval ratings fall 2 more points or disapproval increases more than 2 points (or some combination where the net approval declines 2 more points then the Below -15 probability camp wins. I don't see any trend through April as Trump's approval and disapproval ratings hover at just over 40 and 53 respectively. One standard deviation to the left of the mean puts the net approval number near -18 while +2 standard deviations from the mean puts the net approval rating at less than +12, this effectively eliminates Above +15 as a viable ending net approval number. Regarding the flip from the prior forecasts from a 16% chance above +15 to a 15% chance below -15 was due to reversing the three-day rolling average daily numbers from the Gallup daily tracking chart into their spreadsheet columns, approval numbers were transcribed to the disapproval column - rookie mistake!!...."

Other firms that measure approval rating have found similarly dismal results for Trump.

Not surprisingly things are not looking good, and perhaps (it is just MHO), but Trump doesn't seem the kind of guy that in adverse conditions rolls up his sleeves and tries to reverse things in good faith. Rather blames others, even without holding clear facts. There are only 20 days to go and ratings may not go much lower quickly. We have seen during his meeting with the King of Jordan that POTUS in unable to make a speech, the King stepped in frequently as ""translator"" of Trump's rants. I doubt that he will become much more articulate, and more importantly, an expert in foreign policy overnight, and Xi Jinping may be a little less kind than His Majesty, the King of Jordan."

I thought that -15 points was bad, thus such spread was a strong position. Today, it seems to be breakable with -21. There is much lower than that, and it is possible, could it be! If he continues this pattern -25 is around the corner!"

For DJT to turn this ship around is not going to be easy, the numbers of flops he has generated in less than 30 days is extraordinary, and this is not helping on ratings :)) ( great logic here), I expected a little better from a TV personality and a branding marketer. The clowns doing the rounds on tv need to stop, going to taking head shows is not helping, they waffle people with their self-adsorbed (idiotic) talking points. DJT is enough to get people piss-off. I need to reassess the worse fear of perception and poor performance by DJT. By hearing yesterday's Mitch McConnell blur about messaging, it seems that they have put someone in charge of controlling DJT messaging at the White House. The press conference in SC it seems that it was all tele-prompted and delivered as scripted, with very little off the cuff DJT style. That tells me that this tour is going to prove if the message is getting under control and if that is the case, I can see those 3 points spread to the lower end to come to range. From a socio-statistical point of view it is more difficult that it seems other than an event that will trump it! So I will keep the rating in rage of 80% (this time around) and see how this tour pans out."

A lot of his voters thought that he would not actually do all these things he promised. But look how long it took to bring relations for example with Mexico to zero. Even though a lot of his executive orders will not translate smoothly into actual practice, the damage he can do is real and will drag his approval ratings down Post-script Feb 8: today difference is already -12. So -15 is more likely than ever, because - the base of his supporters will slowly erode, until the real hard core is left. I estimate the hardcore at 20-25 %, and would classify them as immune to information input unless it meets certain prejudices. So my estimate 20-25% is sure for Trump - the balance of his present supporters are those who voted for him because they are life long republicans, thinking ""he won't really do all this what he says"" and/or who bought into the positive message of support for US businesses, esp small businesses. These voters for Trump would presently be in different states of denial, giving him time to find his footing, and hoping things will improve. I estimate at the end of April this group together with the hardcore supporters will have shrunk to 35-38% approval. - the disapproval numbers are extremely high this early in a presidency and I expect them to grow. I assume this comes from Trump's deeply antagonizing style, and this will have an unsual effect in the sense, that a ""middle of the road"" president who faces disapproval will be able to claw back disapproval votes and turn them into approval votes, but a highly antagonizing character like Trump will not be able to do so. Therefore, even if he would put an effort into changing his style and actions, those who disapprove him now, will only convert marginally to approval (may be 5-7% max of todays 52% disapproval, so minimal disapproval 45-47%). Bottomline, basis of supporters will rather slowly but surely erode, dsapprovals will increase and will be difficult to convert back to approval."

First, it is important to note the popular vote as a way to gauge where Trump started off in terms of popularity. It can be assumed that on election day, roughly all 62 million Trump voters would have said they approve of him as a president. So, this would put Trump at a 48.8% approval rating. Between now and then, his rating has sunk down to 45%. Of the remaining population, 45% disapprove and 10% are undecided. Based off of his antics, stances on divisive issues and overall presence, it is unlikely Trump will convince those who already dislike him, to begin to approve of him as a president. However, it is not entirely impossible, which is why there is a 5% chance that Trump will have a +15 net approval. Of those who are undecided, there are a few possibilities. I expect there to be three potential splits - 7% approve and 3% disapprove, 5% approve and 5% disapprove, 3% approve and 7% disapprove. My best guess is that the last option is most likely. The nation mostly belongs to the Democratic party, and Trump doesn't do himself any favors by staying out of the spotlight. So, with the undecided population now decided, the split comes out to a 52% disapprove, 48% approve. This is a net of -4%. This gap could further widen to a 57% disapprove and 43% approve split with a margin of -14%. In other words, Trump would need to lose the support of 3,148,994 people which is roughly the population of Iowa. This is not people that already dislike him - Trump would need to under perform so badly that 3 million of his own supporters would feel the need to reject him. That is a substantial amount, and not one to be taken lightly. However, the political landscape is becoming a minefield. Trump is going to oversee the repealing of Obamacare and sign its replacement into law. In order to live up to campaign promises, it will have to be nothing short of stellar. Speaking of campaign promises, that list has yet to be touched, which could make his voting base start to feel resentful. These factors could play into a substantial loss of support for Trump. As such, this is why I have put the final split of odds for Trump at a 25% chance he has a net approval of -15, 70% that he has a net of -15 to +15 (inclusive), and 5% that he has a net of +15."

I don't see it - Trump has far lower expectations than Obama and a more populist programme - 0% might be a little extreme, but not too much. So - can DJT reach +15? I see it as a possibility. The news media has ""awfulised"" him - saying that he won't be able to govern and yet will do horrible things, that he will be too combative in foreign policy (China) and too non-combative (Russia) - he can't underperform these expectations, they are irrationally bad to start with. So I rate an increase in current position as a 90% chance. How does he get + 15 - I reckon standing alongside Teresa May next month with a positive deal and a state visit to the UK starts to make him look presidential, nominating a decent supreme court justice and co-operating in the repeal of Obamacare should win over some Republicans that he is missing, but before Sep 11 - Bush didn't make it to +15 after his honeymoon faded - http://www.gallup.com/poll/116500/Presidential-Approval-Ratings-George-Bush.aspx .

Hardcore supporters don't seem to be shaken by facts, so the favorables rating is not likely to go down very much whatever craziness Trump does. He will doubtless do something crazy that normally would decrease ratings, but in this case will not. 40/60 at the most. Possibly even 35/65."

So assume 30% of the population remain open to changing opinion. Plus-or-minus 15% means about 3 times as many of those people who were open to changing opinion did so for the better or worse even though they had no strong feeling beforehand. I've weighted more toward ""minus"" because more than 50% of people disapproved of both candidates headed into the polls and 100 days is a short period of time to turn that perception around.
