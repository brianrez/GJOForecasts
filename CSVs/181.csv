No accusations by a NATO member state has been made. There is difficulty in, due to incomplete information, objectively or subjectively evaluating the likelihood of such an outcome. If decision-making has moved beyond the stage of tactical consideration, it is still not clear whether the negative expected utility associated with such an action, given that risk acceptance is bounded in a random walk, limits the magnitude of these risks. EU( . ) = [-1, 1]. In the limit, behavioral costs are constrained by decision-making under conditions of uncertainty given known risks and utilities. Since the IFP only requires a credible accusation, it is increasingly likely that signaling will be made by Ukrainian IC. Involvement by a NATO member state, given a credible report, will require that the conflict escalate regionally. Imperfect information, reputational costs and uncertainty continue to mitigate against such accusations, however credible."

Likewise for Iraq's decades-long campaigns against internal dissidents. I think the only ""recent"" use of chemical weapons in a major conventional, interstate conflict was the Iran-Iraq war in which Iraq used them against an otherwise likely superior foe. Given that there have been dozens of inter-state conventional conflicts in that period with no other uses, I think the base rate of actual, intentional use is maybe 5% and would guess that the current case is about typical. However, a mistaken use, mistaken accusation, or spurious accusation is not out of the question either. So, very roughly going with 10%. Would definitely appreciate if anyone else wants to take the time to make the base-rate calculations more precise/otherwise better by looking more carefully at state-state war in recent decades. Also definitely in the market for reasonable inside thinking about why Putin's army may be more/less likely than this average to use chem weapons."
