Fujimori herself has spent more than one year in pre-trial detention accused of reciving illegal campaign funds and heading a criminal organisation.

But very different for other reasons. Looking at the results of how strongly people would vote for each candidate it looks like a significant proportion of people are strongly against Keiko Fujimori and there are more definites for Pedro Castillo. If there are so many strongly against Fujimori this will make it hard for her to get the number needed, although it looks like a lot of people won’t vote so it may depend on who turns out. Plenty of time for the new guy Castillo to make a mess of things and the familiar lite of Fujimori to feel safer, even if people don’t like her."

Also, with George Forsyth out of the race, his voters are likely to go to other liberal reformist candidates, which Keiko is not. Yohny Lescano is in the lead so far, but the margin of error is too large and too many undecided voters to say he will win with any degree of certainty. In any case, the election is expected to head to a runoff, and the undecided voters could prove instrumental in determining the final election results."

So there's a lot of potential votes out there that we can't be sure about. For another, even if we assume that George Forsyth of National Restoration is guaranteed to go to the runoff, his competitor seems very much up in the air. The next 6 best-polling parties range from 3.78% of those polled to 5.84% in the last five polls. I would imagine the margin of error on the poll encompasses that range. And 3 of the 6 are their own buckets outside the ""another candidate"" bucket, and the ones with their own buckets actually hold seats in parliament, which leads me to believe they're likely to be better recognized and may pull more of the undecided voters.
