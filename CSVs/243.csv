The higher bin would be more difficult to reach at this point, with only 2 weeks left, but with natural gas prices hitting new highs, I don't rule that out, although the index is pretty uncoupled from natural gas prices. But I'm a lot less certain than the crowd is about how this question will resolve. (And I'm sure I'll end up with a lower score for it in the end.)"

Because of the volatility in this index, I'm weighing bin 3 far lower than the crowd. The index moved up ~86 points from July 29 to Aug 5, so it could easily move ~100 pts in the coming 3 weeks.

In the past couple years, the biggest drop in 8 weeks has been just over 300. So I don't completely rule out <600. The biggest gain in 8 weeks has been almost 500, so I don't completely rule out the last bin, either. But unless there's a big shock, the highest bin doesn't look likely. I don't understand why the index isn't falling gently, esp as natural gas prices continue to fall. Maybe this reflects a peak in fertilizer usage? So, it's not clear to me which way this will go. Given the volatility in the index, I also can't share the crowd's level of certainty about bin 3."

Price of natural gas at record highs. Tariff percentages impact roughly 9.5% of increases, potentially more in the future. Russian actions impacting Ukraine are unknown and likely impacting prices (hedging). BIAS Inside look (domestic) first appears important because we care most about our own economy. Closer examination we see that global market signaling plays a more substantial role (i.e. potash, natural gas, etc.) UNCERTAINTY The US is the third-largest producer of fertilizer yet farming efficiencies and desire to reduce chemicals in farming (organics) have reduced fertilizer demand since 1961. The US at 25% of world consumption in 1961 to just 10% in 2018 and if the trend continues shows potentially 5% by 2038. This is the linkage between supply and demand means the US must pay the global prices for raw materials to make fertilizer, even though it is not its largest consumer of fertilizer. Also, COVID interrupted supply chains and production but the rebound from COVID as conditions return to the new normal are unknown. And, Russia, home of Uralkali and EuroChem potash mines, face possible economic sanctions if it invades Ukraine. Finally, hurricane IDA knocked out the supply from CF Industries, the largest fertilizer producer in the world. Plus CF Industries has been forced to close fertilizer plants in the UK due to soaring natural gas prices. Will CF industries return to production or fold? SIGNAL Supply— Ingredients: Global rates for major nutrients used in the production of fertilizer: nitrogen (anhydrous ammonia, urea, or liquid nitrogen), phosphorus (diammonium phosphate – DAP and mono ammonium phosphate – MAP), and potassium (potash). Energy: The price of natural gas skyrockets and increases the cost of production, as in the case of synthesizing ammonia, U.S. producers can no longer compete with other global producers who may have a lower cost of production. Tariffs: New antidumping and countervailing duty tariffs on urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) solutions, a prime material in nitrogen fertilizer, are expected to raise the prices for both domestically produced and imported nitrogen fertilizers by the same percentage as the tariffs, which have been preliminarily Producers: What is the fate of CF Industries (largest fertilizer producer in the world)? Demand— Two-thirds of global fertilizer demand is driven primarily by six crops: corn represents about 16%, wheat about 15%, rice represents about 14%, vegetables at 9%, fruits at 7%, and soybeans at 5%.
