September: According to the National Hurricane Center, there have been two tropical storms in the Atlantic Ocean during the 2020 Hurricane Season. Predicting the weather is always difficult and often leads to much frustration for many citizens. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration went on the record in May, 2020 stating, “an above-normal 2020 Atlantic hurricane season is expected according to forecasters with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, a division of the National Weather Service” (NOAA, 2020). This was further explained as, “NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center is forecasting a likely range of 13 to 19 named storms (winds of 39 or higher), of which 6 to 10 could become hurricanes (winds of 74 or higher), including 3 to 6 major hurricanes (category 3,4, or 5; with winds of 111 mph or higher). (NOAA, 2020). As the professionals’ state, it appears that the Atlantic Ocean surrounding states are in for several hurricanes this upcoming season. As of now, I would put 35% chance of four hurricanes, 30% chance of three hurricanes, 15% of two or fewer, and 10% on each prediction of five or six hurricanes. October: As of October 2020, we have had 9 hurricanes, two being considered major hurricanes, according to the Farmer’s Almanac. However, a new hurricane has emerged and it is expected to cause significant damage, “Delta is forecast to emerge into the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday afternoon and restrengthen into a Category 3 major hurricane, forecasters said” (Rice, 2020). With Hurricane season almost being complete it is my prediction that we will only have three to four major hurricanes. I put a probability of 52% of three with a probability of 48% of four major hurricanes. National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center. (2020).2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season.

Hurricanes need warm water and with hurricane season running to the end of November colder waters normally start in mid October. This Shortens the season by only a month when it starts in June but systems may not be full active hurricanes until mid august.

As of 5 October 2020 there have been a total of 25 named storms making it the second most active in history (Mitchell, 2020). Three of the 25 storms (Laura, Teddy, and Delta) qualified as major hurricanes reaching Category 3 strength or more with minimum wind speeds of 111 mph (Chinchar 2020; weather.com, 2020; NOAA, 1999). Averaging one hurricane in October annually, a total of 18 major hurricanes have struck the United States in the month of October since 1851 (Lam & Dolce, 2020, NOAA, 2018). With Hurricane Delta arriving relatively early in the month of October and hurricane season not ending until 30 Nov, there is ample time for additional hurricanes to develop. The most hurricanes to develop in the month of October is 5 which took place in 2010 (Lam & Dolce, 2020). While it becomes more difficult for storms to form later in the season as water temperature begins to drop, it is clearly evident hurricanes can develop in late October. The latest documented landfall of a hurricane taking place on 21 Nov 1985. However, these storms often don’t reach category 3 strength. Utilizing current and historical data estimate the following; 0% chance two or fewer major hurricanes, 90% probability for 3 major hurricanes, 9% probability for four major hurricanes, 1% probability for five, and 0% probability that 6 or more major hurricanes take place in the 2020 hurricane season."

This leaves a 18% chance of five and 5% chance of six or more major storms. The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season will be ""extremely active,"" per the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The hurricane season for 2020 in the Atlantic runs from June 1 to November 30 while the Eastern Pacific hurricane season runs from May 15th to November 30th. The Atlantic basin includes the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has never forecast 25 storms in a single season, typically only producing 12 named storms in a season. Conditions are more conducive to such storms as water temperature and wind shear as key indicators in predicting the strength of a hurricane season. Both of which are higher than average this year. The amount of available moisture versus the volume of disruptive winds is also a primary indicator. As of 10/7, 25 storms have already been named, with 53 days left in the season. Eight hurricanes have developed this season with three upgrading to a major storm. The three major storms were Laura, Teddy, and Delta. Laura tied the 1856 Last Island hurricane in being the most powerful storm to hit the state of Louisiana. Nine named storms have made landfall within the continental United States. The Greek letter system, resurrected this year, has only been used one other time in 2005. Hurricane Hanna, Isaias, Laura, and Marco have struct the coast in varying degrees, one developing to a category four storm. Total damage is placed over $24 billion with nearly 145 fatalities. Models show that mid-September to November is typically the apex of hurricane activity. Therefore, the season is slowly winding down yet still has the potential to produce another major storm. Thus, three to four major hurricanes will likely occur resulting in a total of four to five major hurricanes for this the entire season, one of the most active on record.

Our initial prediction was 3 hurricanes this season in the Atlantic that will be Category 3 or above. After discussion, judging off our experience living on a popular hurricane affected zone, the National Hurricane Center statistics and radar, history, and current conditions, we maintained our prediction of 3 hurricanes. Weather forecasting changes so rapidly that you can only actually accurately predict two days out. Because we are not God and cannot see the future, the past and current conditions lead us to maintain the 3 still. In the last three years, 2017 had 6 Cat 3’s, 2018 had 2 Cat 3’s, and 2019 had 3 Cat 3’s. While it is predicted to be a busier season, we have seen plenty of tropical storms and cyclones, but nothing breaking category two so far. At the moment, there has been no Category 3’s. The season still has time to brew up some storms though considering it ends in November. Three gives enough cushion room in case there is a sudden stirring in the Atlantic."

Since there are no hurricanes developing as of 14/06 I fail to see why these predictions could be so high.
