Then these other countries are likely to contribute at most 0.2M additional cases to the total by the end of April. I'll count on 0.1M. Then need 5.3M more cases to get to 20M by April 30. It's a very tight forecast, but assuming growth continues unabated, India and Bangladesh will together contribute about 5.7M additional cases by April 30, so that SE Asia will get to 20M cases by April 30.

I almost left out bin 2 because I think it will be impossible to reach 20,000,000 by the date on that bin. I say this because the average cases per day on the last full week posted to WHO is 29,524.2857 cases per day. It would take at least an increase of about 6 times the number of cases seen in the last week to make the total get into bins 2 and 1. At the current case rate average, it will take 260.4 days to reach 20,000,000. This would put us at Wednesday September 9, 2021. Each day that goes by with new case numbers lower than 45,500.183 cases per day causes the number to increase until eventually it will get to a point that it will not be possible to have that much of an increase to be able to reach 20,000,000 by that date, similar to what we are seeing with bins 1-3 right now."

As the rate seems to be continuing to slow, I will continue to shift my response, but at 35,500 per day, it would take until Friday, 13 August. There is always the potential for a surge in cases again, but it seems to me that this area is doing well in handling surges and getting numbers back down. I will update again in a few weeks."

I do expect the case rate to go up in the coming months, and then fall off significantly over the next few months as we move into summer weather. IT is very difficult to determine future numbers based off of a base rate that does not include the potential for exponential increases, however, I am going to estimate with high confidence that it will be sometime in ""bin 4"" for now based off of the daily average (which should account for an upswing during flu season, and a downswing in the warmer months) and update as needed."

Interestingly their peak did not come at the beginning of covid but rather throughout September where they had quite a few days of over 100,000 cases. This is important because it shows they had a rise even with all of the measures and knowledge we had. Lately they have gotten it down to under 55k a day. If we use 60k as our average to give some cushion for randomly high weeks we will hit another ten million in 5 and a half months (167 days). That would mean the beginning of May. I am unsure about how a vaccine in the beginning of 2021 will alter these numbers so I am putting more weight on it being after May rather than before. If they were able to keep their average at 50,000 a day they would keep it under ten million until 200 days or around 6.7 months still before July."

I don't think that the region is going to see a second wave as severe as the first, either, though I may be wrong, which is why I give this scenario a rather high probability at this time. I do feel that the region will hold (roughly) steady in terms of new cases. This would put the region on a path to 20M by about Mid-May, hence giving the probability of the May-June option the highest allocation."

SE Asia is demographically one of the youngest places in the world, so less risk there.

Many governments may also want to report the figures later to not appear like a spike took place over any celebrations, so as to spare the short term economic shock of cancelling celebrations."
