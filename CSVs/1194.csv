I’m sure the company wants the tech to be absolutely as perfect as possible before rolling it out. Releasing that tech in less than 4 months does not seem likely at all."

It is only designed to make the driving experience easier. This is far from full autonomy. Tesla autopilot cars have to first safely navigate within and around other traffic first before they can focus attention on navigating traffic lights- and this goes beyond merely stopping at them. Musk himself in an April 2019 interview estimated that by the middle of 2020, Tesla’s autonomous system will have improved to the point where drivers will not have to pay attention to the road. At this investors event, Musk made a series of bold predictions today about the ability for his company’s cars to completely drive themselves- and Musk thinks it will happen sooner than most of his competitors — perhaps as soon as the end of this year. A release can mean many things- and in the context of this forecast, it is assessed by the forecaster that ""release"" means available to the general public. https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/22/18510828/tesla-elon-musk-autonomy-day-investor-comments-self-driving-cars-predictions. As discussed in similar articles, the technology might be ready at the end of this year- yet only maybe for the streets next year. https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/04/22/tesla-says-its-fully-self-driving-car-tech-autonomous/3540926002/. Seeing that the developer of the technology concurs with a 0% possibility before 01 January 2020- never mind state laws http://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/autonomous-vehicles-self-driving-vehicles-enacted-legislation.aspx. Even today the NHTSA report that automated or “self-driving” vehicles are a future technology rather than one that you’ll find in a dealership tomorrow or in the next few years. https://www.nhtsa.gov/technology-innovation/automated-vehicles-safety. If that is not enough, just this year, Musk admitted mistakes caused Tesla's Model 3 production delays. http://fortune.com/2018/06/05/tesla-elon-musk-model-3-production-delay/. Ironic he stated, “One of the biggest mistakes we made was trying to automate things that are super easy for a person to do, but really hard for a robot to do,” Musk said. Remember, Musk is known for setting ambitious goals and timelines for the electric car company, but he isn’t known for hitting them. Plus a recent partnership between SpaceX and NASA is going to divert development attention and resources from the navigable autopilot features. https://www.nasa.gov/spacex. A goal’s emphasis is on the definite objective while ambition can also refer to the level of determination that is applied for the pursuit of the goal. A goal refers to the development of the cognitive processes- while in contrast, ambition is the development of the future. Certainly not a bad thing, but it is clear which of the two Elon Musk embodies most."

Despite the hefty price tag of Model 3, X, and S cars, one of the most distinguishing features of Tesla models is the autopilot feature. At this point in time, the autopilot feature is intended solely for highway trips where a driver would not encounter traffic lights, stops or roundabouts. The company plans to expand this feature to be fully self driving capable. On December 9, 2018 Elon Musk tweeted ""Already testing traffic lights, stop signs & roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all."" The company announced that these updates will be implemented ""soon""."

Having been driving automobiles around traffic lights since the Kennedy Administration, I estimate the probability of all this going well at maybe 70%.

Tesla's claim to stay ahead of the curve might prompt the release of this feature even if only to support that reputation, which in turn could also boost sales and help the company turn a profit.

When a car ignores a red light and causes a crash, it seems to be harder to talk oneself out of it, than when a crash happens in a situation where humans often err as well. On the other hand, the technology seems to exist in principle; the question is how much training time Tesla had and how much of a risk they are willing to take soon.

Lights knocked off by a collision, overhead lights getting unstrung, temporary lights, lights at roadworks suspended in favour of a man with a stop-go board. Think of Las Vegas; how does it pick out red? Not only is the system non-repeating, it can fail. if the lights are stuck, a human can see the unusual pattern of traffic and adjust. If some idiot decides to jump the lights, a human can respond. In a black-out, humans can judge the over-ride. And in any legal case, death or injury at a lights system is normally regarded very seriously indeed. For a fully automated system to work, this has to be included, but the chance of it being legally permissible on public roads by 2020 I think is slight, and dependent mainly on Mr Musk's vanity and the ability of his legal team to think up an extraordinary defence for the first accident."
