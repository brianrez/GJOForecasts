Could have been promises to field weak candidates against them in their next elections (2024 for both), assuring their reelection in tough states for Dems to win. Maybe that's too big a promise if the GOP thinks they have a realistic chance to win those seats? So can Dem leaders promise them something in the next few weeks that would cause them to change their minds and allow the Dems to take up this vote again before the 2022 midterms?
