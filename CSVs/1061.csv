The leftist incumbent, Evo Morales, is gunning for a fourth term on a platform of economic stability. Thanks to a commodities boom and redistributive policies, annual growth has averaged 5% since he first took office in 2006. The share of the population living on less than $1.90 a day has dropped by two-thirds. But Mr Morales’s popularity is threatened by public anger over his slow response to wildfires in the Bolivian Amazon and his defiance of the constitution and a national referendum vote to run again. The government is spending big bucks on propaganda and freebies—including ovens and tractors—to try to avert a run-off against Carlos Mesa, a former president, on December 15th. The threshold for winning outright in the first round is 40%, with a ten-point lead over the nearest rival. Polls suggest it will be close.“"

Morales is the incumbent, and there is risk of corruption working in his favor, especially with the concern about running for another term. However Mesa is also really well known. Perhaps the decision will be made by the departments with the large cities. In the cities, Morales has the absolute larger vote, because he has more votes overall, however, Mesa's supporters are generally urban. 65% of the population is urban: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia#Demographics Everything I read suggests Morales has the rural areas sewn up, so it really depends on if the cities are more concerned about corruption and the threat to democracy of re-electing Morales, or other issues like the fires.
