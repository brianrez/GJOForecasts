While I do believe an effort exists to unseat him and he is not always the most popular with certain NATO members, I believe he has staying power, and it is unlikely he will cease to be president by November 25, 2022. I believe it is overconfident to believe Russia and Ukraine are closer to peace talks than they are. The timing isn't right. Advantage is in Ukraine and Zelensky's favor currently, where his cessation as president is concerned. I also don't believe Zelensky has the type of personality to cut-and-run. That's not his style. He has also managed to survive multiple assassination attempts. If he were to cease from power, Ukraine would also fall simultaneously, or that occurrence would be imminent. I see it as unlikely that he will leave voluntarily. He has high poll numbers within Ukraine. His popularity and the high confidence he instills would be difficult to replace. A successful assassination would only make him a martyr and further Ukranian spirit and cause, inspired by the legacy he has personally nurtured on behalf of Ukraine. Strategically, he is unlikely to ""flee"" or leave the country, as a public event."

Hence, from my point of view, the Ukrainian armed forces will make it an absolute nightmare to take control over major cities like Kiev. Also, the military missions in Afghanistan have shown, how easy it is for rebellious groups to hide even under the worst circumstances.

Further, there's still a <3% chance the entire country could fall before November despite Russia's revised stance of wanting to 'liberate' the Donbas region.
