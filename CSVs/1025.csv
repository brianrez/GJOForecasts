31802,2019-12-24T10:26:42Z,1,[40.0],[40.0],"The time series itself is not complicated. Different models (ETS, ARIMA) give almost the same probability that the 4% limit will be broken (14%). However, history tells us that the unemployment curve is severely disrupted when there is a recession. From former recessions we learn that on average the unemployment rate rises with 0.23% per month. At the moment (data Nov 2019) we are at 3.5%. It would take little more than 2 months before the limit of 4% is broken. So the real question is: will there be a recession in the first nine months of 2020? The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has a model. The success rate of this model in the period from 1961 up to now is 5/9=56%: in the nine situations where the model had a peak probability for a recession of 40% or less (about what is predicted for Aug 2020), the recession did materialise in 5 cases. However: the Fed did react swiftly when the spread (this is the predictor that the Fed's model uses) went negative in the period from Jun 2019 to Sep 2019. So this might have an impact. Therefore I take my forecast a bit lower than 56% and put it on 40%."

20284,2019-11-17T18:20:52Z,1,[3.0],[3.0],The current economy continues to create jobs and even a slowing will take time to begin to affect this statistic. More time than projected in this question. After the next election it is possible depending on who ends of winning.

The previous inversion of the yield curve suggests that a recession will happen. The fact that yield curve inversion has stopped is largely unimportant.

However, last month it was just 3.6% and there are signs that the U.S. economy is holding up well despite a global slowdown [2] - so, unless economic conditions change, as of now I find it unlikely that the 4% mark will be reached despite a base rate that indicates this is likely. I mostly hold this view because the unemployment data shows that, barring a recession, the U3 rarely rises steeply - and a recession seems unlikely at the moment. I will revise if the unemployment rate ticks up from 3.6% in the next few months."
