There is an interesting behavior in all cases but Denmark: in the last six months, the proportion of people with only one dose constantly decreases. This might seem obvious since most people who got the first dose will get the second one; however, this could also mean that the vaccination rate is slowing for good, probably approaching a ceiling level for the country. I suspect the anomaly for Denmark that happened in Nov 2021 is due to the introduction of a new population: children 5-11 years old (https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/denmark-officials-reason-give-covid-vaccines-82822229). That boosted the vaccination rate, but then it plateaued in two-months time. All of this to say that I believe the only significant game changer to increase the percentage by 5% or more would be the introduction of a new population. And according to the German site, almost all the people who got the first dose have already gotten the second one, including children 5-11 (https://impfdashboard.de/)."

If vaccine uptake remained constant at this level, then approx. 73.4% (total fully vaxxed on Jan 24) + 0.5% * 2 weeks (the next 2 weeks) + 0.4% * 1 week (the week after that) + 0.35% * 15.3 weeks = 73.4% + 6.3% = 79.7% would be the total on June 1. (It could be closer to 80% due to rounding errors.) But I think we can expect vaccine uptake to continue to fall off, especially as Omicron vaccines start to become available this spring. And it doesn't look like a vaccine mandate will be in place by June 1, as negotiations will take time in Parliament; if a vaccine mandate is successful, it is expected to be in place in the fall.

Vaccine mandate will arrive later than expected, if ever. Cities such as Bremen, which claimed to have the highest rate in fully vaccinated adults across Germany, has the fastest spread in omicron cases recently. This points to two issues: high vaccination rates tend to mull the fully vaccinated share of populations in a false sense of security, which in turn tends to accelerate the spread of highly transmissible variants through risky behavior. Secondly, for the future this could deliver an argument to people skeptic of the value of vaccinations, since the expected high level occurence of breakthrough infections will even out the urge to get first and second shots. The correct percentage is going to get more difficult to predict, since it largely depends on the final conditions and the effective date of any form of future vaccine mandates and can vary much for supply, seasonal and event driven reasons. However, it seems the forecast can nevertheless be narrowed down increasingly to the fourth bin, since new first doses are applied at a by and large constant and consistent rate at the moment and the current target rate the government has laid out (including people 5 years and older as far as I understand) is 80% as a foundation for stopping the spread of SARS-CoV-2 with a pandemic character. The uptake among school children, whose vaccination campaign has started just before Christmas, appears to be quick and promising - logistics currently still seem to be the root cause of delays."

Unless a new wave of 1st doses picks up again, rates will be well on track for bin #3 going forward. We will need to wait a bit longer to see how the political debates and parliamentary voting unfold regarding mandated vaccination in ~Feb-March.

Considering new vaccine orders (abundant supply) and a protocol that in most cases will hand second dose by week 6, 80% of the (eligible) German population could be fully (as far as the term is defined at the moment) vaccinated by mid-March 2021. There's plenty of time to get things straight with regards to a vaccination mandate, even though Germany's Justice minister appears to be somewhat retarded. Getting vaccinated will appear to be the lesser evil than footing the pandemic's bill by paying a hefty non-vaccination fee and will thus motivate most eligible individuals without counter-indication to get their jab. Whether or not ""more than 85.00%"" are attainable, wil critically depend on the Novavax subunit product (""Nuvaxovid"") becoming available and recommended by the STIKO (""Staendige Impfkommission"") soon in large amounts, and on improvements in vaccination logistics (mass vaccination sites, order management etc) under the newly inaugurated army specialist Carsten Breuer, now responsible for streamlining processes. https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carsten_Breuer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kommando_Territoriale_Aufgaben_der_Bundeswehr"

First dose uptake has doubled over the last 30 days, and I think will keep increasing beyond the peak of the wave due to ongoing public concern, especially now there is also talk of further mandates, another variant, potential regional lockdowns, and even compulsory vaccination on the horizon. For the latter, I expect the proposal to go to debate in Parliament, and perhaps not pass - partly as the motion would not be til February/March by which time we'll either have quite low cases, or an Omicron wave. In either case it is a contentious proposal that may be less effective than positive encouragement at a time when the second dose rate should already be quite high. https://www.dw.com/en/covid-incoming-chancellor-scholz-wants-vaccine-mandate-in-germany/a-59979157 https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/rise-german-covid-19-infections-flattens-2021-11-30/"

The incoming Chancellor wants to have a vaccine mandate in place with deadlines in Feb or March, but that may or may not happen.

Another thing is that there are not only AfD supporters who don't want to get vaccinated â I know as a german. ;-) Plus Germany is awaiting a vaccination recommendation from the StiKo in December, but only for children of 5 or more years. Many parents will be reserved getting their children vaccinated, especially those under 5 years (around 4 Million -> 5%).

Another way of looking at it would be that Germany is currently vaccinating about 300K people per day - assuming they were to ONLY do 2nd doses, they would need only 5 days at that pace so that everyone who has received a first dose gets a second.

This is likely to continue until after the peak is passed (transferring to full doses approx 6wks later), before trending back, and continuing lower from 1.8%. (Unless Gov mandates further). So minimum for next 6 months is 67.5% + increased rate to 2.4%/month tapering to 1.2% = 78% Maximum includes slower tapering each month + 20% uptake of 5-12 yr olds as ~7% population (+1.5%) = 83.5% I think it will decided by the timing of the vaccine for this younger group, as it otherwise looks very close to the break point to me."

Children will be able to be vaccinated within the timeframe and can expect a fast uptake to a similar level as rest of population (60% ish) but probably higher There is around 5.5 million 5 to 12 year olds - around 7% so this could add 4% quickly My expectation is that the lid for vaccination saturation will be over 85% so not worried about that currently about 36k/day, 0.3%/week which would get us to 78% If it went up at the most recent rates 325k per week then would add another 10% ie 80% if the current rate of increase continues then it could be higher but to reach 85% and outcome 5 then would need around 480k 2nd doses per week Which they may be on track for in 1st doses next week if the momentum keeps going. Last time 2nd doses was this high was back in Sep but remembering the potential for 4% quick boost for kids coming in which makes the rest of the population easier to get"

So, my initial forecast will be based on a reference scenario of ~0.046% increase / day (roughly 38k people/day), which has been apparently observed over the past 5 days on average. Obviously, there are many other social factors to consider such as vaccine hesitancy (particularly in areas like Saxony), or the possibility of more aggressive government mandating (and enforcement!) of vaccination status in the future. These factors are hopefully well accounted for by the subjective and broad uncertainty range that Iâm placing around my back-of-the envelope straight-line calculation that would predict ~75.5% full vaccination, if every day until June were like the last 5 days."
