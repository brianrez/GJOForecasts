Although police in the country also tend to be very good at preventing protests so I don't think its very likely.

As of today, no incidents have occurred into September. Repressive tactics against political opposition members and dissenters are not uncommon in Zimbabwe, however it recognizes the value of tactics that do no result in fatalities, unless there are militarized interactions between the government and its citizenry. E( Y | X = x ) coverages to zero in its limit given choice over time by the ruling government."

Putting in a number to account for the odd rogue cop or politically-inspired bar fight that might count, but it's probably too high."
