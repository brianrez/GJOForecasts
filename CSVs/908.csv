31275,2020-06-08T17:03:01Z,23,[62.0],[31.0],"Since Administration wants replacement and not extension the formal negotiations might not start by October. A delay is happening because Billingslea’s Congressional confirmation is being held-up until Trump explains all the IG firings. Still after reading tweets by some Administration officials it appears talks will take place. It is also conceivable an extension will happen. Depends on how hard core Trump is about his agenda having China participate. All the talk about returning to nuke tests, arms race might just be posturing. Raising some on other side of 50. Tough one. Note again to followers: I am taking way too many questions to do Superforecaster level work (made it twice). Do your own research."
88410,2020-06-08T16:29:28Z,4,[35.0],[0.0],"My prediction remains at 35% for this week, despite The United States and Russias recent intercommunications. On the 26th of May, United States Press Secretary Kayleigh Mcenany held a briefing regarding the recent riots and protests circulating the U.S. She mentioned a brief call that occurred between President Trump and the Grey Cardinal President Putin earlier that day that piqued my interested. I remained vigilant in observing the news for an update on the conversation. On June 1st, news sources confirmed that that a White House released a statement saying the conversation topics included “the latest efforts to defeat the coronavirus pandemic and reopen global economies” and “progress toward convening the G7.” Considering the totality of events, from the pandemic in Russia and the protests in the U.S., to the restructuring of the political structure in Russia leads me to believe that there is a 35% chance that a renewal START treaty by October 1st 2020. (Especially considering the expiration date is in February and the START treaty historically has an average statistic of being renewed in December). My highest percentage leads to the START treaty being renewed by the end of the year, as opposed to some time next year, as this issue is not as prevelant as others to the international community at this time."

89020,2020-06-06T15:02:01Z,1,[16.0],[16.0],Though I think the chances of at least signing an extension are quite high (Robert O'Brien has said negotiations are going to happen) I'm not sure about the deadline. The fact that nothing has happened so far implies that Trump is going to draw this one out for as long as possible. There is also the added safety net of the Russians saying they will sign it (Which should make the process of extension simpler) and so Trump can cut it fine. It's also another thing that can be used against China which he might want to save.

Trump has a history of walking away hoping that will result in later leverage. They could conceivably meet on an informal basis to see if there is enough agreement to start formal negotiations. When Obama set-up New Start there were informal talks before they got into formal negotiations with details and working teams. https://sldinfo.com/2020/06/new-appointee-delineates-trumps-nuclear-arms-control-vision/ https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2020/05/trump-administrations-aggressive-approach-arms-negotiatons-could-backfire/165334/ I am going to go slightly below 50% contrary to the crowd.

While these statistics also show that these agreements are generally renewed one year prior to the expiration date, as of this month, COVID19 is increasing in Russia. This means that Russia will experience the side-affects of the virus later than us. Furthermore, the United States President should be tentative about traveling and conducting meetings considering what is happening within the White House at this current moment in time. That being said, the capabilities of telecommunication convince me they can achieve this date. I believe that there is a 30% change that the extension could occur by December.

This situation can be described by a quote from the Economist “Both sides have reservations that need to be dealt with before an extension can be agreed—but nothing that cannot be overcome given sufficient political will. Serious negotiations need to start soon to get a deal done in time.” (1) It seems likely that there would be serious steps to make these negotiations happen if they would benefit Mr. Trump. In the comment noted by O’Brien on CNN, there is brought to the table the importance of nations, not just the US and Russia- with this in mind, there may be pressures for both parties to move forward in starting the negotiations now rather than later. The sources provided show the importance of negotiations as 2021 will bring the end of the old treaty and the need for the New Start treaty will be crucial (2). Finally, with either pressure in full swings such as the COVID-19 pandemic and US 2020 election underway, I think there is reason to believe negotiations will be pushed back. Though, these same factors make me think that as many things seem out of control at times, the beginning of these negotiations (that may take quite some time) will be even more neccessary going into the Fall of 2020. Based on the factors discussed, I forecast a 45% chance that they will start before October 1, 2020. This forecast also accounts for the fact that negotiations may start in the time after Oct 1 and before Jan 1 2021."

While proponents claim that it has strengthened international security and strategic stability, and Russia has indicated its willingness in the past to discuss extensions, President Trump is no stranger to flouting established international norms and is a vocal critic of nearly all of Obama’s policies. He has expressed the desire to renegotiate a better deal for the US with respect to US-Russian arms agreements, and has also indicated that he wants to involve China in the next treaty iteration: this would serve no purpose for China as it has a far smaller nuclear arsenal than either of the other two countries and thus would clearly get the short end of the stick in any deal involving the three. Lastly, the coronavirus pandemic means that, for the moment, the treaty is not the highest priority for the Trump administration; this may change if the pandemic comes under control, but for the moment Trump’s attention is surely divided."

From the treaty: ""Duration and Withdrawal (Article XIV) The treaty’s duration is ten years from entry into force (Feb. 2021) unless it is superseded by a subsequent agreement and can be extended for an additional five years, until 2026. As in START I, each party can withdraw if it decides for itself that “extraordinary events related to the subject matter of this treaty have jeopardized its supreme interests.” The treaty would terminate three months from a notice of withdrawal"". 99% yes 2) Looking at the answer to question 1: has anything significant changed, that would make NOT extending reasonable ? Answer: They didn´t even withdraw because of Ukraine etc.. Trump has been in power long enough not to consider him a risk on this one, Virusses don´t affect nuclear arms. And nuclear weapons are and always will be a very significant thing to talk about together. I don´t see any reason NOT to extend. 99% yes 3) In which form will they continue talking About it? Answer: regarding the word ""or replacement"" it doesn´t matter here. 100% yes 4) Is this going to happen before or after presidential elections? Answer: if before, it would need to start soon to have a result before November. 80% yes 5) How long will negotiations take? Answer: no clue. But I think it would be so long, that starting negotiations before 1 october would be necessary even if the result is planned close to february 2021. adding 10% yes to Number 4"
