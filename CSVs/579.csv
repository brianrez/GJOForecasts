However, election fraud has been a huge problem for Russian citizens. Leaders of the opposition party such as Alexey Navalny have been jailed or even exiled, and citizens who have supported opposition have been disenfranchised. Electronic voting and the severely limited ability to watch video streaming of polling stations by the CEC (Central Election Commission) have made it obvious that voting may be skewed. Most polls have reported United Russia to win around 300 seats, maintaining their majority. Despite this, the United Russia Party has seen its lowest popularity rating in 15 years - reported around and below 30% - suggesting the opposition will win seats in many of the single mandate districts where many United Russia candidates have done no campaigning at all. The amount of seats won by United Russia will likely depend on the severity of election fraud as well as voter turnout, which has also been low, reported at just around 31%."

Freedom House speaks of 'controlled elections' but no full-blown dictatorship results (e.g. North Korea). Combined with 1), this means low chances of a result below 226. 3) In 2020 the results of the constitutional election showed significantly more support for the constitution than ex ante independent polling. This might be a sign that the polls underpredict results for the ruling party. 4) in a controlled setting, the risks of cancelling an election are low. The optics of cancelling elections are poor (costs are high) whereas you are not concerned about the result anyway (returns are low). 5) at the same time, polling shows Putin's popularity at an all-time low."

Last time around (2016) UR won 140 of party list seats and 203 of fptp seats. However even if you assumed all 203 fptp seats are kept and the party list seats dropped by 40% you would still be well below 300 seats, you'd need only a 32% drop in party list seats only to get below 300.

While the Kremlin did have good local elections in autumn, probably through heavy manipulation, given scale of social unrest in recent years, it might be too big a risk to rig the Duma elections too much this year, and so a simple majority in the 226-299 range is probably the most likely. That said, the creation of new systemic opposition parties enables United Russia party protect a large majority in the Duma without increasing its vote share, by splitting the opposition vote. This tactic could however be countered by the real opposition if they can promote 'smart voting' strategies to gather the opposition vote. Altogether, lean towards the simple majority option, therefore."
