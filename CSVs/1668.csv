368,2018-02-13T03:53:29Z,241,[0.0],[0.0],"The situation remains exceedingly complex and ripe for outcomes initially unanticipated. That Zuma will leave office is clear. However, a more important question is when and not whether. After the record NEC meeting (~15 hours), Ramaphosa returned to Zuma to convey the decision that he needs to resign (again). Zuma steadfastly refuses. Given the following issues, the crises is still ripe for conflict. Zuma is supported by at least close to half, and the largest number of ANC members in the organization. This has a likelihood of the following: Zuma leaving when chooses, creating his own party (as stated repeatedly), and the ANC will split down its center at all levels, including its highest political structures. This creates a serious dilemma for Ramaphosa; he will govern with a weak power base with strong collective opposition in an unofficial coalition between Zuma and center left parties in parliament. More urgently, we can expect a significant increase in the levels of violence in the country in the short term accompanied by assassinations on a level not previously seen, capital flight, depreciation of the Rand and unstable investment potentials in the near and long term. Chaos on the parliamentary front can be expected, a possibility of an entire cabinet resigning under the scenarios of a no confidence vote or impeachment proceedings and or legal maneuvers. The legal dilemma the organization faces is the following: Zuma remains the president of the country, distinct from or despite his role in the party and the insistence by the NWC/NEC demands. Ramaphosa, as head of the party is in no legal or constitutional position to force removal or resignation, despite organizational recall. Zuma may constitutionally remove Ramaphosa as Vice President despite his position as head of the party."

The State of the Union speech postponement is significant - it can't be delayed for a long time without creating the impression of a disarray and crisis. The NEC meeting was supposed, according to rumors, to recall Zuma, and observers interpret its postponement as a sign of Zuma agreeing in principle to step down. Looks like Ramaphosa's gamble has worked, and Zuma has (reluctantly) ceded some ground. The specifics remain to be finalized, though. In case Zuma changes his mind, Ramaphosa also has the scheduled Feb 22 vote of confidence in his pocket, but I think he'd rather not use it as it may divide the ANC. Still, it is quite significant that Ramaphosa managed to convince Zuma's supporters to agree to the apparent ultimatum Zuma was given yesterday - if you do not resign, the NEC will recall you. I didn't expect that."

I think this is an attempt to persuade Zuma to go ""the easy way, or the hard way"".

Remains to be seen if the pressure would work - I suppose the ANC leadership wants Zuma to announce his departure in the State of the Union speech on Feb 8. If he doesn't budge, the ANC would face a difficult choice - remove him via a divisive vote of no confidence, or not remove him (cancel the vote, or vote against). Either of these latter options may actually strengthen Zuma's position in the talks on negotiated exit. But the pressure is on, so he is unlikely to survive all the way to July 1. (He may still announce a departure date after July 1, though)."

Much as I expected, Zuma is negotiating for his supporters to remain in power, and Ramaphosa is finding hard to accept that. Still, the pressure on Zuma is on. The ANC will elect its national working committee and heads of subcommittees this week - watch out for whose supporters will prevail. This may affect the negotiations."

As we saw in Zimbabwe, in some African countries there is a high value put on the appearance of law and order; the Zimbabwe military was determined that their involvement in the change of government in Zimbabwe NOT be called a ""coup"". Something similar seems to be happening in SA. Ramaphosa has several reasons for not wanting a coup (including that almost half of the ANC still supports Zuma), and he doesn't want Zuma's dirty laundry hung out for all to see through the impeachment process or another vote of no-confidence because of how it would further damage the image of ANC. So, all the stories are of pressures being brought to bear on Zuma to voluntarily resign. Zuma's conditions are making the news; the fact that he's negotiating tells me that it's just a matter of time."

Majority rule often have inefficient outcomes and, more importantly, aggregate decision making does not efficiently convert from individual preferences. Given Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem and the unlikelihood of a destabilizing decision by the NEC (ie., removal of Zuma prior to 2019) decreases the probability of this outcome significantly. Politically, Ramaphosa will be used as a constraint factor while the deputies (who still have a deep personalistic devotion to Zuma, via ethnicity) exert an asymmetric balance of power; the continuation of the Gupta connection will constrain Ramaphosa’s efficiency in contestation over corruption, factionalism and organizational fractionalization. These factors result in a weakened power center for the executive along with a partial increase over organizational power which still results in an unstable equilibrium."

What the next move for the NPA and Zuma will be, is open to debate. One possible outcome is the reimposition of those 6 particular charges potentially resulting in a deep political fissure resulting in removal from office. On the other hand, the proportion of the winning Zumba coalition in government and its attendant fractionalization within the ruling party will remain unifyed behind its leader. With potentially new judicial appeals, it leaves the former outcome (stated above) in a politically intractable situation. Consequently, nothing is likely to ‘stick’ given a strong state, strong (despite fractious) ruling party and weak, but contestation ally strong civil society institutions and domestic dissent. Logically, the status quo ante bellum will remain."

I think this means the ANC would need 67 votes to defect in order for no confidence to occur, which seems like a high number (more than 25% of the ANC), though I suppose it is possible. Zuma could still cease to be president of SA for a reason other than this no-confidence vote. [edit Aug. 6]: I think Mbete will try to move forward with an open ballot and litigation will ensue over whether she made her decision on a rational and proper basis or whatever."

Odds are certainly 2 to 4 percent for the next year (see for the US: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html; cf. http://flowingdata.com/projects/2015/life/). * Vote of no confidence by parliament: party has majority (249 out of 400 seats), Zuma won previous votes of no confidence (party discipline in South Africa seems to be strict, according to expert judgment: http://constitutionallyspeaking.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/De-Vos-Party-2015.pdf; https://www.jstor.org/stable/723341?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). But might be possible if he loses the backing of ANC (see below). Will see in August… * Impeachment: Did not happen, so far. There is no discussion about it, so far. Would be disastrous for ANC… better would be to remove him. * Disastrous re-election prospects for 2019: President is elected by parliament; so it comes down to ANC electoral prospects. Zuma cannot run for the presidential office since there is a term limit of two consecutive terms. ANC won the regional election by 54 percent of the vote share (this was after the first corruption charges were raised); so there is a downward momentum (additionally to a large number of ANC voters that did not vote at all) that could do harm to the hegemonic status of ANC in the South African party system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_municipal_elections,_2016). This is underscored by polls for 2019 (http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/anc-faces-real-prospect-of-losing-2019-poll-8752385), approval ratings (http://www.enca.com/south-africa/polls-south-africans-disappointed-by-political-leadership), and the demonstrations. Additionally, there is a big issue which fuels the dissatisfaction of the citizens (next to the corruption issue): the national debt and the junk status of the national bonds - all of which is connected with sacking the former finance minister Pravin Gordhan (https://www.ipsos.com/en-za/south-african-youth-concerned-about-effects-downgrade-status; see the prequel of this story, here: https://www.cfr.org/blog/south-africas-president-zuma-trouble-his-party). * And alternatives that emerge in ANC to Zuma: There is some dissatisfaction with Zuma. There is the pressure to present somebody other than Zuma (due to the presidential term limit). Generally, there are competent and even charismatic options, such as Pravin Gordhan or Gwede Mantashe, but they need a power base at the ANC that suffices to get the majority of the party behind themselves."

Their judgement has provided a broad opening for Zuma; the speaker of parliament, determined by the court must make her own determination about whether to hold a secret ballot. Mbete, one the core 6 leaders of the ANC will undoubtedly argue for transparency and an open vote. While this move seems innocuous, it provides ANC MP's (who view their duty to the party as foundational, and to society as secondary) with a high probability vote against the no confidence vote in Zuma. A myriad of factors account for strict voting blocs within parties, in this case, understates the role of intimidation, threats and assassination squads against party members who do not tow the party line. There has been a worrisome increase in the number of assassinated leaders, both intra and interparty in recent years ~ 3 -4 years. Ideological shifts from the proscribed 'democratic centralism', a Leninist view of the role between party, state and power consolidation, remains a cornerstone of the 'South African democratic model.' These views are a strong ideological holdover of the Stalinist and Leninist influence when the party was banned, its members and leaders in exile, and the positioning of their cadre training in the former Soviet Union, East Germany, Cuba, Angola and the myriad cohort support by autocratic and dictatorial regimes, notwithstanding the role of the SACP and global support by anti apartheid activists unaware of the rooted views of communism. While some believe in the correctness of their decisions, the primacy of the party and its unity moving into the December elections are paramount. Despite Mbete's previous declaration of impartiality, she is a Zuma ally. Her choice to do otherwise will create momentous pressure from within the majority of party structures and the expectation of severe sanction from party leadership where she is one of the six most powerful in the party. The roles of the ANCYL and the ANCWL is not to be underestimated in these dynamics."

So far, he has been able to deter challenges to his grip on the ANC, thus the presidency, but the ever increasing problems he faces are building to a critical mass. Ironically, it is in trying to contain those growing problems that he will lose the presidency. In effect, through the effort of plying different stakeholders within his base of support, that is the ANC leadership and constituency, Zuma will have to either engage in deal-making or demagoguery, and both options have their drawbacks. If it is the former, the ANC leadership is not monolithic and is composed of diverse personalities and interests, all of which are jockeying for the aftermath of Zuma's presidency and if Zuma empowers one to the detriment of others, the ones left out will coalesce against him. For the latter, if Zuma attempts the demagogue route and engages in stocking racial and social tensions to keep power, he will alienate the leadership of the ANC and also incur a challenge from the far left. Consequently, Zuma days in office are coming to an end."
