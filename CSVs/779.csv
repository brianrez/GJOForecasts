Although the facebook stock has de-coupled from Nasdaq 100 and has thus become an alpha trade over the last few days, earnings and news tend to be traded on only as long as they are rumors, and tend to stop doing so when they're facts. I struggle to interpret the news on tiktok with regards to facebook's future, but when you look at it closely, the risk of espionage on personal data (especially when they get lost by the company) is not so much different from the one in facebook's data pile, so recommendations of the pentagon may also apply to facebook and their lax data handling. Combining this with the repeated congressional hearings, it seems to me that ""nationalizing the data stock"" could to be a target of national security authorities in the US with the ""National Security interest"" as a reason, in which a significantly lower prize and finally a buy-out could be the result. facebook already acts like a governmental body in times (e.g. supporting ""predicitve policing""), so why not be a national agency openly in the future? To me it seems, the process has already started in 2020."

When a growth stock stops growing it can be reflected in the stock price. July 8 it closed at what looks like all time high at 243.58 and went higher after hours. Earlier this week it went above 247. Will 4 weeks show a dramatic turn-around and investor flight? Long term prospects are good, but are it's followers buy and hold types or momentum chasers?

Add to that privacy concerns raised by TikTok that will be covered in the media and inevitably renew the concerns about other social media privacy. Finally, people are 'out-and-about' this summer, concerned that fall might bring more shut-in time, so there will be less social media activity than there was this spring"

The stock recovered quickly and overcompensated for previous losses due to a unique position and financial strength. As stocks in general are currently ""ambitiously priced"" to say the least considering political markets ahead of US presidential elections and economic reality, the Nasdaq100 is likely to fall over the next month. High beta means facebook is likely to exaggerate the drop and will fall even more. I guess the stock is going to have a ""double- to triple top"" on all-time-high around 250USD before the stock's long lasting trend will finally break, I'm not sure, however, if this is happening during the month proposed in the question. As some of the recent troubles with business and advertisement partners will grow and awareness of the dangers that an unregulated facebook poses to societies and democracy (and the damage it has already done in the past) among those in charge will rise , headwinds for facebook are going to get rougher, and the company is likely not going to pay any dividend anyway. So things are never going to be the same, easy cakewalk for Big Data and social platforms again, competition watchdogs as well as politicians will be forced to have a closer eye on Mr Zuckerbergs Money Bin, it will be tougher for facebook to aggregate and centralize peoples' online lives by simply buying every promising start-up that was thought as an alternative to facebook, and democracies can no longer afford facebook's outlets to distract everybody from urgent real world problems that need to be solved or to manipulate the political process in their own best interest. Maybe, as a good side-effect of the pandemic, people will realize how uninteresting and shallow their lives on Instagram used to be, and how lukewarm the word friend has become, after facebook monopolized it. The bad thing: facebook already knows you better than you yourself, which makes everybody susceptible to blackmail, even those decision makers. And policing without facebook's APIs is hard to imagine nowadays. Strong sell, in the long term - a breakup is more a matter of how and when, than if, imho."
