It was determined soon after that Amazon interfered with the vote, but to what degree? Maybe they slightly scared a few people away from voting but it certainly couldn't have been drastic. So assume that the issue with the mailbox and Amazon chicanery is remedied. I gave 5 percentage points to the 29% base = 34%. But then a ton has to come off for the fact that an Amazon union has never succeeded and Amazon is Amazon and they HATE unions. So even with their public stance of allowing it; they will figure out a way to undermine it. So due to the track record of Amazon unionizations and Amazons shadowy influence, I took 15% off = 19%"
