It will be suspended on 31 March 2019 and will be resolved in January 2020 after EWP assesses the situation in Yemen from January 2019 to December 2019. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilian fatalities occur in one or more campaigns.

A coalition of Arab countries assembled by Saudi Arabia launched an air campaign against the rebels in March 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to power. Parties on both sides of the conflict have violated international humanitarian law. So far, there have been approximately 67,654 to 90,100 deaths overall in Yemen (Human Rights Watch, 2019) of which approximately 6,872 to 7,000+ civilians (HRW)."

Starting with the baseline figures, regarding the EWP report, it is important to take into account that mass killing as such is a rare event. Statistically, one or two countries per year face mass killing. Yemen ranks 6th highest among 162 countries and is considered as a country with 'consistently high-risk'. However, experience shows that facing significant risks doesn't automatically mean gives an assumption about the occurrence of mass killing. According to EWP, top-risk countries that were high in the ranking of risk, have yet to experience a mass killing onset. Another important detail is that the EWP concept of mass killing is specifically addressing internal threats and excluding foreign countries. Hence, as we are not including killings perpetrated by foreign countries' armies into the definition, the chances of mass killing to happen are decreasing even more just because of the complexity of the definition. In addition, I give a 5% likelihood that the mass killing will occur in Yemen during 2019. Despite the arguments expressed before, there are also a lot of uncertainties regarding Yemen. Therefore, knowing that Yemen is very high in the EWP risk assessment, there is still a slight possibility that mass killing can happen in Yemen."

But it did not happen in other Arab Countries after the Arab Spring - Tunisia, Bahrain, Morocco, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Yemen. So 4 out of 14 countries had a mass killing.

One could argue that their reasoning is based less on logic and more on motivations and other pulling factors (push and poll), make them highly unpredictable as motivations and pulling factors could change drastically from day to day. This is one of the reasons why I have decided on a low percentage for this forecast. However, the forecast is also based on: 1. Even though the death tolls are high, accurate numbers are hard to come by, however Save the Children estimated that around 50,000 children had died on 2017, not only due to the conflict, but also the ongoing hunger crisis (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-46261983). The Human Right Watch stated in a report that as of November 2018 6,872 civilians had been murdered due to the conflict (https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/yemen). With that being said, as the Early Warning Project state in their 2018-19 Statistical Risk Assessment For Mass Killing no mass killing has occurred so far during the conflict, actually the country has not seen a mass killing since 1945 (https://earlywarningproject.ushmm.org/countries/yemen). As one knows, historical data is extremely important when making a forecast, and based on the historical data, together with the capabilities of the armed groups from Yemen, I find it very unlikely that they will be able to systematically kill 1,000 or more civilians. 2. Speaking of historical data, a quick Google search (I.E. 1000 civilians killed) will show that the main results involve sophisticated militaries such as the U.S. and the UK, adding armed groups to the search will not alter the results by much, but when it does it will alter the number of casualties in the mentioned attacks, such as death tolls as low as 18. This speaks to the fact that it is very unlikely that the Yemen armed groups will beat the statistics and systematically kill a 1,000 civilians or more. 3. Being able to poll of an attack as mentioned in the question at hand takes many resources and military capabilities the Yemen armed groups are not in possession off. In the Google search mentioned in point 2, all attacks that involved 1,000 civilians casualties or more happened during airstrikes, or as mentioned with/ or with assistance of sophisticated militaries and their weapons. Even though some foreign states have been getting involved in the conflict by for example providing weapons and other military support, it is unlikely that this will help the Yemen armed groups in this case, especially considering the other points made above."

Moreover, excluding the sadly frequent casualties derived from military accidents, the events in which 1000 civilian casualties could be made are reduced to massive terrorism attacks or specific campaigns directed to the civilian population (what we could call an Uganda scenario). I would say that the kind of warfare, the overall path the war is running and the size of terrorism attacks - generally leading to not more than 250/300 casualties - lead to think to the questioned event as very unlikely, even if the Early Warning Project put a 16,1% probability for this event to happen in 2019."

Even if so far there has been some disagreement between the two about the control of cities like the port of al-Hudaya (claimed by the government while the rebels want it to be under the UN supervision); the ceasefire has been respected by the conflict parts, plus supported by international actors like USA, UK, Europe. This could let me forecast that the war, in its 5th year, is might finding an ending. Moreover, I believe that there would not be reasons for the Yemenites for engaging a mass civilians kill. The conflict is the consequence of a complicated and turbulent transfer of power from the autocratic regime of Saleh (Huthi side) to Hadi, during the Arab Spring.

To struggle the Huthi rebels, Arab intentionally policy is about to beat them because of starvation, and that’s why they would be responsible of food blockage. According to UN, Thousands more civilians have died from preventable causes, including malnutrition, disease and poor health and Yemen is descending toward famine. Nevertheless, these measures are taken by the Arab government and not by the Yemenites actors, and that’s why I don’t think that any Yemenite armed group would cause the death of more than 1,000 civilians. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29319423"

Thus there is a reduction. Moreover, this is not chance for a systematical mass killing, engage by an armed group from Yemen. EWP also demonstrates that Yemen never had a mass killing, nor any ongoing mass killing. According to the UNHCR, from 2015 to September 2018, at least 6 660 civils died. The UN said 10 000 civil casualties since one year and half. However, in Yemen, there is no reason to kill civilians, both sides seek to satiate their legitimacy and their claims. Popular support is very important, especially in civil wars. This idea of ​​popular support tends to demonstrate the impossibility of a mass killing consciously perpetrated by the Yemeni belligerents. In December 2018, a cease-fire agreement was signed in Stockholm between the belligerents with the help of the UN, which tends to demonstrate the collapse of the war. Russia, the United States, Europe and the countries of the region agree that the war must be stopped. The chances of a process of exit from the conflict in Yemen appear to be becoming clearer. This cease-fire therefore considerably reduces the chances of a return of a big spike in tension, like 2014-2015, and therefore the possibility of a deliberate campaign of mass killing. Nevertheless, indirectly, if we consider the policy chosen by the Arab coalition, the food blockade of the country, as a deliberate policy of mass killing, through famine, to struggle the Houtist partisans, and the fact that the Arab coalition includes forces loyal to the Yemeni president, then an armed group of Yemen would be possible to be considered indirectly responsible for a voluntary mass murder during this war, according to the points of view. The blockade of the country by the Arab powers has caused the ""worst humanitarian crisis on the planet"" according to the United Nations: 7 million people, a quarter of the population, are on the verge of starvation. Notwithstanding, for answering the question for 2019, since the case of the assassination of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi on October 2, 2018, Mohammed Bin Salman and his coalition have lost many Western supporters, and critics have streamed about the military ways of the kingdom. It is therefore unlikely that it will continue in this form (hence the blockade), and therefore the chances of a voluntary mass killing (indirectly supported by a force in the Yemenite presence) are drastically reduced for the year 2019. Apart from a renewed hostilities and the renewal of the war, it seems very unlikely, nearly impossible, to witness a voluntary mass killing in Yemen by a Yemenite armed group."

A 10% likelihood is estimated for this event to realize. Hereby, the EWP condition has to be stressed, according to which the executing actors have to be from Yemen. The EWP explicitly excludes cases of casualties caused by foreign armed groups. For the forecast at hand this is particularly important due to the Saudi lead alliance supporting the Yemeni government. According to the research group The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), 6.480 civilians have been killed since 2016 as a result of 3.071 attacks that directly targeted them. Two third of them were caused by the Saudi-lead coalition, and thus have to be excluded (https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/yemen-60000-dead-armed-violence-2016-research-group-says). The same holds true for the Saudi-lead coalition’s broad restrictions on aid and essential goods to Yemen’s civil population, which could be otherwise counted in due to the amount of critically food insecure people (https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/07/yemen-coalition-blockade-imperils-civilians). The rest of the attacks were conducted by the Houthis (1.027 civilians), the Saudi backed government, AQAP and Isis, as well as further secessionist groups in Yemen’s south (https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/yemen-60000-dead-armed-violence-2016-research-group-says). The forecast at hand assesses the capacities of all of these actors as too limited to effectively conduct a systematic campaign to kill more than 1.000 civilians within the year. Of them, the Houthis would still be in the best position to conduct a campaign of this magnitude, in particular by means of missile attacks. However, the likelihood of the event at hand to materialize gets further decreased by the ceasefire agreed in Sweden in December that call on the government and Houthis to recall their troops from ports, as well as the latest agreement on the first phase of a withdrawal from the key city of Hodeidah (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/17/yemen-and-houthi-rebels-agree-to-withdrawal-deal). The struggle about this area,“whose port is the principal lifeline for almost two thirds of Yemen's population” (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29319423) was the main reason for the last drastic increase in causalities after the coalition launched a major offensive. Within 4 months, civilian deaths raised by 164%, with 500 people killed in only 9 days (https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/sep/26/huge-spike-in-yemen-violence-as-civilian-deaths-rise-by-164-in-four-months-hodeidah). This emphasizes how fast the situation can escalate, in particular if the demilitarization of the port cities fail and serves furthermore as a justification for this forecast to stick to a 10% likelihood for a campaign by an armed group, killing more than 1.000 civilians in 2019."

Moreover, following the murder of US-based Saudi Journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the Coalition has weakened as several European countries and the US have taken action against Saudi Arabia to express their distress e.g end of arms export, end of US aerial refuelling for the war operations in Yemen (reuters.com). In that sense, the end of the year 2018 brought new perspectives on the conflict that has entered its fifth year. For instance, a cease-fire — yet fragile — came into force in December 2018 (reuters.com) presupposing the improvement of the situation. In that sense, it is very unlikely that an armed group from Yemen engages in a campaign targeting civilians for the first time, this year."
