The European Central Bank (ECB) has taken actions to combat the disruption by using monetary policy to stabilise the financials with an aim of gaining a 2% inflation rate. The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in loss in productivity due to social distancing, mass unemployment that decreases incomes that results in a reduction of demand of goods and services. A second wave would prolong the downturn by the postponement of large ticket consumer goods (white goods, cars) and possible investment by companies. A potential four waves of the pandemic (as experienced by the Spanish Flu) would see a continuation of supply/demand situation through until 2022, that would see a subdued inflation rate for an extended length of time. https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2020/html/ecb.sp200610~a16c903e5c.en.html"

Here is a link on how to calculate it (https://www.thoughtco.com/probability-union-of-three-sets-more-3126263). Doing it for 15 periods is quite tedious, but you do get convergence with really low probabilities.

I also forsee a slowing of the economy and possible recession which will put downward pressure on inflation. But I count 8 occurrences since Jan 2014 (11.59% of the time), so there is a base case for it to happen. Granted most of these occurred in 2018 and it has been trending downward since then.
