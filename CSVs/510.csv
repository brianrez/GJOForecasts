Several Australian leaders have been voted out recently by their party room on almost that little.

Prior PM terms was: 3 years, 2 years, 2 months, 3 years. So it won't be unusual if he is replaced before end of 3 years. So 1% is too low, 5% might be a decent guess. However - with 5% you still have 1 in 20 scenarios that leads to him being removed. From a gut feel I think this is too high. So I will bring it down somewhat... what is the correct answer?

Morrison generally has a clean profile though so it seems he should be able to weather the storm unless his coalition falls (which isn't impossible). In the near term there are likely more pressing issues and it would take a larger no confidence for that to happen. His approval rating has dropped (from 62% to 57% in recent polling) but far worse leaders have stayed in office with far lower approval, albeit not in coalition governments."

He does have credit in the bank by gaining an unexpected victory in the 2019 Federal election and although his ratings have fallen to their lowest since the outset of the Covid pandemic, they are still historically high. This may drop by attitudes changed by later sex claims. Leadership spills (as they are known in Australia) are usually led by a chatter amongst the political classes and that has been absent here, according to reports. In the midst of the pandemic, the party appears to be loyal to Morrison and rule changes brought in by him make a leadership change to be harder to engage in. Two caveats: 1) Australia has a habit of regularly changing its leaders and 2) five months is a long time in politics (especially the Australian version)."
