"In Gundy v. United States, will the Supreme Court rule that Congress' delegation of authority to the attorney general in the federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) violates the nondelegation doctrine?",2018-09-21T17:00:00Z,2019-06-20T17:00:44Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['US Policy'],211,654,115,237,"In 2016, Herman Gundy was convicted of violating SORNA for failing to register as a sex offender in New York (SCOTUSBlog). His underlying conviction requiring registration was in 2005, before the enactment of SORNA (Office of Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending, Registering, and Tracking). On appeal, Gundy argues that the section of SORNA granting the attorney general the authority to ""prescribe rules"" that apply to him was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the executive branch (SCOTUSBlog). The Supreme Court is expected to hand down its decision in its 2018 term, but if it does not, the question will resolve as no. Confused?

Gorsuch because of the things he said during oral arguments . Then, based on the percentages of which Justices vote with him the most, I come up with a starting number. In this case, J. Thomas (84%); J. Alito (84%); CJ. Roberts (81%). I don't have good numbers for J. Kavanaugh, so just for fun, let's make him a slightly more conservative J. Kennedy at 86% (J. Kennedy was 82%). So J. Gorsuch votes with this group 83.75% of the time. Leads to a 5-4 decision that has happened 12% of the time in the current session...so 10%-ish. I'm not taking into consideration any other factors.

The case involves whether mandatory registration as a sex offender may be imposed retroactively. The legal issue concerns whether the Constitution allows Congress to empower the U.S. attorney general to act retroactively without explicit guidance on use of that power. It has been 83 years (1935) since the Court voided a government action on the basis of the nondelegation doctrine."
