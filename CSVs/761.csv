It is also a safety concern in relation to floods The dam flooded various areas and has therefore increased risk of landslides locally There is minimal rainfall during September so a reduced likelihood of landslides The lifespan is somewhere between 50-100 years, especially with maintenance The dam sits on a seismic fault and the land in the area is experiencing erosion Long-term studies on the Yangtze Three Gorges area found that the crust in or around the dam site is stable, but a tectonic background exists that could induce seismic activity. Earthquakes: o 2008 – 4.1 magnitude; o 2013 – 5.1 magnitude From June 2003 to November 2008, 5503 earthquakes (M ≥ 0) were recorded by the Three Gorges seismic network. This total includes 4362 earthquakes of 0. 0 < M < 0. 9, 1030 earthquakes of 1.0 ≤ M < 2. 0, 106 earthquakes of 2. 0 ≤ M < 3. 0, and 4 earthquakes of 3.0 ≤ M < 4.0.

If I were an engineer on Three Gorges Dam or a leader in China I would be both looking to improve the dam and ensure that there are solid contingency plans for the surrounding area. However, given the short term nature of the question and that the hight of monsoon season is passed in China I'm rating the possible of a failure as 0%. @pstamp That was an interesting simulation.

The weather forecast for Zigui County forecasts rain to continue incessantly in the next 10 days. The government has already blasted open a dam in Anhui. Chinese Dams have been poorly maintained and rarely reinforced. Furthermore, the Dam is more vanity project than hydro-electic engineering marvel (Mao Zedong was obsessed with the dam); in spite of its enormous size, it fails to produce as much electricity as the Itaipu Dam - a dam with 2/3rd its capacity and turbines. The US Glen Canyon Dam also failed in response to the floods of 1983. Also noteworthy: just days after the first filling of the reservoir of the Three Gorges Dam, around 80 hairline cracks were observed in the dam's structure. Since then, Chinese inspection has stated that ""163,000 concrete units were assessed (...) with a pass rate of 100%"".
