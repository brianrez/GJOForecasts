The historical (1990-2020) average MoM change november-december has been -0.27% and for the last decade -0.15%. If you take the greatest decrease in the same period of -3.99% (2008) the index could go down to 129.03. For the index to go down to 130.0 the index had to go down -3.27%. The historical probability for this given the MoM changes since 1990 is of 7.13%. Therefore At this point I am assigning a 93% probability for more than 130.0 and 7% for between 120.0 and 130.0.

Cereals have pptential to continue to climb higher than 132. Put it all together and the index is not closing below 120 for Dec. The index for next 2 mpnths, i think, will be driven by veg oil and cereal. If veg oil drops from 168 to 156 and all else is flat then index closes below 130.

The index went down to 124.6 in the latest report, largely because of a huge, nearly 10% drop in vegetable oil prices, which are finally coming down. Everything else pretty much canceled out. Cereals and dairy went down, by 2.6% and 1.0%, respectively. Meat and sugar went up, by 2.1% and 0.9%, respectively. It's conceivable prices could be even lower by Dec., if cereals crops and the oil production/consumption balance are as good as forecast. I'm still not as sanguine about cereals production forecasts as the futures markets are currently, but realistically, production will probably be very good. And if cereals can keep falling or at least stay stable, so should meat and dairy, to a large extent. So I'm shifting my forecast downward. 6 months left to go. It's not unreasonable to think we could end up back where the price index was around Oct. or Nov. 2020, just over 100. I am still trying to force myself to spread out my forecasts over more bins. I haven't done that very well on this question so far. Trying to improve."

Oil is an input to food production so that is a base support for higher prices. Sugar is rising due to conditions in Brazil, but thus rise can turnaround and remove pressure. US wheat production looks like it may be stronger then people think, another pressure relief. China demand may back off if COVID continues there, which is another pressure relief. So in conclusion, oil supports index over 120. But production increases and demand reduction may allow for index to settle below 130. Of course, index could close over 130 December.

Looks like growth in the index might be slowing down, but it's hard to say what's going on (for me, at least). This month's index value was higher because all of the component indices went up a little bit; oils were up only 1.8% in the past month. I think it's likely that dairy and sugar will fall a bit over the next few months. I think there's some risk that cereals will go up, though, if expected bumper crops don't materialize because of unexpected weather events, etc. Potential effects of the pandemic on production, consumption, exports and imports in South Asia and South America also adds uncertainty.

Food is globally traded so the valje of the dollar is significant. So as dollars flood the system the dollar becomes weaker and more dollars needed to buy the same amount of food. This assumes no change in supply. If supply increased as dollar weakened then the two could offset one another but that depends on rates of change. I believe drought in US and Europe will reduce supply of wheat and grains. Finally there is a restriction in available containers used to ship certain food products which will increase food prices. So i decided to be more bullish.

This is what the onset of the current price rally in September 2020, and the sharp price increase in mainly Cereals and Vegetable oils suggest. These two likely also have the heaviest weight in the basket of five subsegments. All other segments have increased only moderately and are still below the average of 116.0 as of Feb 2021. Going back in history, 2008/09 and 2011/12 appear to be an apt comparison to 2020/21, and in both cases, one year of sharp price increases, driven mainly by cereals and vegetable oils, was followed by a year in which the FFPI dropped either sharply (2009) or moderately (2012). While Sugar was a third sector with drastic price changes in both of these cases, it does not play a role this year obviously, as world supply for export from the Northern hemisphere could be sufficient. My guess is prices will continue to rise in H12021, before they drop moderately in H22021 with the harvest in the Northern hemispere (e.g. wheat production in Russia largely determines the world export price for wheat) towards the end of the year.

I'm assuming the recent rise is mostly pandemic related. Also I think the rest of the world is a ways off from being out of the woods as far as the pandemic goes, even though the US and other rich countries look like they should be seeing better days this summer due to vaccinations. So I think there's a good chance the index continues to rise through 2021. However, the US sounds like it's one of the larger food producers, so if the US can get its economy back to a relative normal this summer maybe it can bring food prices back down a bit which might keep the FAO index from rising so much. But an increase in inflation could also cause prices to rise more. Based on those considerations I'm putting the most weight on it increasing into the 120s or higher, though setting a decent amount of weight on it staying about the same or coming back down."
