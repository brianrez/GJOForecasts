The announcement of the NI tax increase and the furore within the right wing / Tory supporting press may be an indicator of some shadow manoeuvring taking place between Johnson and Sunak's offices in the wake of Johnson's hard fall from grace in recent months [1]. Worthy of a proper analytical and review at this point therefore.
