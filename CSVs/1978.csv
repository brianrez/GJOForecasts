Country Reports: Middle East and North Africa Overview - 2015: http://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2015/257517.htm - In 2015, Iran’s state sponsorship of terrorism worldwide remained undiminished through the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF), its Ministry of Intelligence and Security, and Tehran’s ally Hizballah, which remained a significant threat to the stability of Lebanon and the broader region. Chapter 3: State Sponsors of Terrorism Overview: http://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2015/257520.htm - IRAN Designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism in 1984, Iran continued its terrorist-related activity in 2015, including support for Hizballah, Palestinian terrorist groups in Gaza, and various groups in Iraq and throughout the Middle East. In 2015, Iran increased its assistance to Iraqi Shia terrorist groups, including Kata’ib Hizballah (KH), which is a U.S. designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, as part of an effort to fight the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Iraq and bolster the Asad regime in Syria. Iran used the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF) to implement foreign policy goals, provide cover for intelligence operations, and create instability in the Middle East. The IRGC-QF is Iran’s primary mechanism for cultivating and supporting terrorists abroad."

Syria and Sudan were also listed as state sponsors of terrorism. The report states that the Islamic State is a larger threat than al-Qaeda, but that its recruitment and territory in Iraq and Syria have been significantly diminished since 2014.

To that end, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has placed an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander at the head of the country's complex military establishment. Maj. Gen. Mohammad Hossein Bagheri took office as the new chief of the Armed Forces General Staff on July 5, marking the first time that the IRGC's leader has filled the position. Because the IRGC is widely perceived to be the best-equipped and best-trained branch of the Iranian military, the country's leaders may be hoping to bring the rest of the defense forces up to speed by having them follow the IRGC's example. But another motive could be behind the promotion. Iran's economy is opening up as a result of the country's recent nuclear deal with the West, and some of Iran's most powerful stakeholders — the IRGC included — could see their strength erode because of it. Granting the military organization control over other politicized institutions, such as the armed forces, may be Khamenei's way of ensuring the IRGC's continued influence and, in doing so, protecting his control over one of Iran's most formidable groups.'

There is a recent historical example of what can happen when a country is taken off the list prematurely. N. Korea was taken off the list in 2008 as part of a bargaining chip in a nuclear agreement and once they were delisted proceeded to back out of their agreements, for instance, they began to limit IAEA inspections. However, the most likely reason it will not be taken off the list is this is an election year and making such a bold move, even if it were warranted, would be political suicide especially in an environment as contentious as the current one."

Also be aware that in some regions the U.S. is supporting Hezbollah, but the U.S. supports both sides to a conflict in many areas. Overall the U.S. is essentially a puppet of Saudi Arabia and Israel in this region of the world, and as a result I see the narrative continuing that Iran is a bad actor.

However, this could be used as a bargaining chip, for example to get Iran to the table in an anti-ISIS coalition with Saudi Arabia (though since Iran is already ideologically opposed to ISIS, the Saudis are more likely to need the prodding) or to get the Iranians to support some other Middle Eastern initiative."

On the other hand, the definition of what's a terrorist and who are their sponsors is more fluid than national decisionmakers often pretend. This is a fairly cheap bargaining chip, so it will depend on what the US is offered in exchange. (Once again, one feels compelled to point out that much of the time this stuff is nothing to do with facts on the ground and everything to do with castles in the air. Who wants what, who's got it, and what's it worth to both parties?)"

Iran has been on the list for so long , I donot think they care much about it.
