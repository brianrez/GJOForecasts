I looked at Amazon sales rankings for the books near the bottom of these lists. ""Superforecasting"" sales rank is no where near, except for some autobiographies (i.e. ""Sully"" and Patti Smith's book), but I expect that these books are finding their audience elsewhere, not on Amazon. ""Sully"" may be sold at big box stores due to movie tie-in. Patti Smith has a niche audience. ""Superforecasting"" depends a lot on online sales, so Amazon's ranking is important. I'm not seeing any reason for sales to surge before the end of the year. There may be some purchases for assigned reading in university courses; if people buy through university book stores, I don't think it will count. In any case, most of that should be past by now."

Since the book has been available to GJO forecasters, I don't see a huge surge in sales from that sector, and I don't think that airport kiosk sales will generate a spike that would be sufficient to get the book on any NYT list."

We have little effect on nuclear weapons talks, currency exchange rates, or even election results. The number of book sales required to hit the Times list is a lot smaller than the number of votes needed to carry North Carolina or even New Hampshire. So those of you who have friends or funds or both (I have neither, fortunately) can do rather a lot to hype this book and help the resolution become a Yes. This insertion of an episode of shameless self-promotion into an exercise of some integrity is extremely unfortunate, and in my opinion unethical--at least equivalent to and perhaps worse than making your students buy a book you wrote for a course you teach. By way of protest I'm picking a low number and sticking with it. Y'all do what you like."
