The projected incidence of the virus for October 2021 in Chad suggests that a further postponement is possible for the same reason. There is currently no political pressure from other states to my knowledge to incite these elections."

Three Burundian peacekeepers were killed and an additional two were wounded. The attack occurred hours after a rebel coalition fighting the government called off a unilateral truce and reiterated calls for the suspension of the election.[...] During the first round, voting was unable to take place in 29 of the 71 sub-prefectures according to Augustin Yangana-Yahote, the Minister for Territorial Administration. Six others only managed to partially vote before being shut down due to voter intimidation.Observers noted possible irregularities in the conduct of the election. An observer group reported that a large number of voters cast ballots with letters of exemption in Bangui. The procedure allows voters to cast their ballot elsewhere than the polling station where they are registered. According to the Rainbow Network, 81 percent of the votes were cast in this manner."" Faustin-Archange Touadéra has been voted president in the first round due to a slim 53% majority, which is however obviously the intended result of massive irregularities. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%9321_Central_African_general_election#Conduct"

On the other hand, Trump did not care about these minor things, but Biden might. So Biden may talk to Macron to pressure Deby to allow the election to proceed for the sake of image. They held elections up to 2011. But then again the election result is not in doubt so why spend the money. Start at 80 and prbably walk it up to 100 over time."
