Economy, breakthrough news on foreign affairs and a returning attention to politics by many 2016 Republican voters will decide the election. Whereas Democrat voters have maintained a high level of political attention following the 2016 election and thereby influenced surveys on voting intentions for the midterms, a large number of citizens who voted Repubican in 2016 are not usually interested in day to day politics. They are silent but in the last week or two before the voting they will take interest and they will be again the ""unexpected"" voters who will cause predicted election results to be off the mark."
