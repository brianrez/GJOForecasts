It may be true that citizens who are afraid are easier to rule, since they tend to be looking for strongmen. However, creating a problem that is there for its own purpose of one party and the incumbent pretending to have problem solving competencies is just ridiculous, most intelligent voters will see through this scheme. However, even intelligent voters may rightly be afraid of the future, especially when it comes to the very near domestic future in the next half year, and election procedures. Also however, Republican voter base mainly recruits from white rural non-college educated voters, so the strategy may just work as planned and send a few but significant municipalities over the brink to ""see what happens"", before finally any money will be released."

Without Federal Aid to States that they can pass to cities there is no way they are going all make it. Maybe because of 2008 cities are better prepared but the cost here in terms of no taxes is unprecedented. I am raising this slightly a little above 50%.

Around the 2007/2008 recession, the highest point was 10 bankruptcies in 2009, indicating a lag. So a priori, despite the bad situation, we wouldn't expect bankruptcies to turn up this year. But maybe the loss in revenue is so great that they'll be forced to act sooner. In 2009, this sheet (https://www2.census.gov/govs/pubs/state_loc_gov/state_loc_gov_2009.pdf) indicates that local government revenues minus expenditures summed for a shortfall of $200 billion. Assuming the current shortfall will be broadly similar, then 3/4 of the shortfall will be mitigated by the government's stimulus. In addition, it's not clear that property values will fall as they did during the 08 recession, and property taxes make up a significant portion of municipal revenue: in 2009 they constituted 3/4 of all municipal tax revenue. Still, the situation is unusual, so I inflate my estimate form 10% to 25%."

Right after 2008 housing crash. - There tends to be a lag in bankruptcy filings (1 - 2 years after an event.) Took about 9 months after 2008 market crash for filings to begin. I would suspect more in 2021/2022 than 2020 - Some states require their authorization for a bankruptcy filing - The states that allow municipal bankruptcy without state approval are the larger populated states. Perhaps this increases likelihood of more filings this year - These bankruptcy filings were predominantly in states where municipalities do not need state authorization - One so far this year - Fairfield in AL. Will others be influences to follow suit or will local governments hate the thought? Election year.... - Only 7 months left in 2020, so tempering likelihood of reaching 12 bankruptcies but wary that healthcare special districts tends to be the most impacted - I believe Feds will attempt to support favored cities from bankruptcy - a total mix of red state/blue state in the 2010 - 2014 bankruptcies"
