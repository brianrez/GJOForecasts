In the balance is the extension of the 2010 New START treaty, due to expire in 2021. President Trump has expressed reluctance to renew the agreement in its current form. Since the July 2018 there have been two iterations of high level U.S.-Russia talks held, including one between the Heads of State. This has seemed to decrease tension. The U.S. recently certified a Russian surveillance aircraft for the Open Skies program. This is an indication of both leaders viewing a measure of credibility at stake with reaching a positive outcome."

Although a New START Treaty is being considered for extension, there should be no anticipation for the expedited sunsetting of the INF. The U.S. believes Russia violated the INF by testing and deploying a prohibited Intermediate missile system. Russia believes the U.S. has already de facto withdrawn from the INF through its deployment of the Aegis Missile System Ashore in Romania. Putin asserts the system can be easily modified to become an intermediate missile platform and that the U.S. is making provocative moves to intentionally give cause for its future exit from the INF. Still, U.S. National Security Advisor's recently held bilateral talks with his Russian counterpart specifically addressing this issue which appears to have been fruitful with reduced tension."

That being said, I doubt that Russia would take this step - their election interference in Western democracies has begun driving wedges into old alliances and sowing distrust. To withdraw from this treaty would risk galvanizing NATO countries to come to the defense of Eastern European nations. Conversely, at a time where its commitment to Western alliances has come under scrutiny, it is unlikely the Trump administration would risk this move, especially when known Russia hawks like Mike Pompeo and John Bolton hold important foreign policy positions."

The treaty, signed by the USSR and the U.S. in 1987 with the goal of eliminating the respective short range (500-1,000 kilometers) and intermediate range (1,000 - 5,000+ km) missiles, notably did not include provisions concerning sea-launched missiles. In other words, both sides can deploy ship or submarine-launched vectors with ranges comparable to those considered in the treaty, without violating it. Furthermore, since 2016 the Russians have permanently deployed IRBMs in their Kaliningrad Oblast (located between Poland and Lithuania), justifying the move with the need to ""counterbalance"" American initiatives aimed at deploying anti-ballistic missile defense systems to Europe. All considered, rescinding the treaty in the short term would serve only the political purpose of increasing the tension between the two superpowers. I deem such course of action unlikely for both Russia and the U.S., considering the current political climate on both sides."

However, President Trump wants to continue trying to improve relations with Russia, and suspending or withdrawing from the treaty would be antithetical to that goal. It also provides little benefit for the US when other types of weapons factor much more prominently today than Cold War-era ballistic missiles. President Putin is already taking aggressive steps in other domains (i.e., annexation of Crimea, 2016 US election meddling) that have been exposed and have resulted in further sanctions and indictments against Russians. Therefore, he also is unlikely to take such a provocative step as openly suspending or withdrawing from the treaty when Russia has relatively little to gain from such an action. https://thebulletin.org/2018/08/the-wrong-response-to-russias-inf-treaty-violation/ https://www.brookings.edu/testimonies/the-future-of-the-inf-treaty/"

However, the current level of contention over alleged treaty violation is still rather moderate, and it is extremely unlikely that by Oct. 2018 either side would take the dramatic step to suspend participation in or withdraw from the treaty. Even though the US has voiced vocal criticism of Russia's alleged treaty violations, it has also pursued a policy of inducing Russia back into compliance, and the latter has made no public threat of suspending or quitting the treaty. Especially considering the Trump administration's substantively appeasing attitude toward Russia, it is very unlikely that it would allow something as dramatic as suspending or quitting the treaty to happen."

This announcement not only makes it clear that Russia does not intend abide by the INF treaty, but also acts as further evidence of aggression. Moreover, the recent assassination attempt by nerve agent in Great Britain is thought to be ordered by the Putin Administration and resulted in the expelling of 23 Russian diplomats in the UK, and 60 Russian diplomat in the US, and other allies are following suit. While this does not directly relate to the nuclear treaty, the rapidly increasing tensions is a good indication that either the United States or the Russian Federation will withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Treaty."

It is continuing to build out the anti ballistic missile defense system, which uses a starting container, which can be used for tomahawk cruise missiles. This is a violation of the treaty. Furthermore, US is teaching pilots of non nuclear NATO members to drop nuclear devices. This is also a violation of nonproliferation treaty. In short, similar as with treaties regarding chemical weapons, uranium, and many more, USA did not care to obey by the contracts it has signed. NATO expanded towards Russia, another example. For US it is not really an issue, rather for the Europeans. For Russia, it does obey to all treaties it has committed itself to, and obviously would prefer to limit the intermediate range rockets. It has however, developed sea and air based cruise missiles, which have countered the American ones. This is the reason why the US is not happy with the situation, since it left intentionally those sea based cruise missiles out of the treaty in question, assuming that Russia won't be able to develop those, and because USA is able to project it's military power mainly by sea. Furthermore, the weapons presented at the address to the Nation on March 1, 2018 by president Putin have put the USA in a shock condition. The public did not completely digested it yet, that from now on for a forseeable future and far beyond, the US has lost the ability to even dream of to threaten Russia militaraly. It was not publicly discussed, but NATO, US as the leader, have indeed planned to be able to neutralize Russia's strategic nuclear potential by encircling it with missile defense systems, thousand of cruise missiles (over 2000! are dislocated right now), in order to be able in a surprise decapitation attack to destroy most of it strategic missiles, and to intercept those few left. An unresponsible and adventurous plan, but that is what it is. Further more, the plan was to use mini nuclear devises to limit the conflict to the European war theater. That is why Putin in his address also warned directly the US Administration, that any nuclear attack on the Russian federation will trigger immediate and full scale response against American soil. This is the proper deterrent for the American adventurers in the administration to prevent war and secure peace. But furthermore, as mentioned above, the new generation of strategic weapons have left the NATO, US completely defense less. This is true not only in regards to strategic missiles, but also the huge air carrier fleet became basically useless against Russia and it's allies. Game over check mate! The baseless hysteria and media circus with fictious toxin attacks, and what ever may come, like soccer boycott.... It is all just dust in the face of its own population, which is left without defense due to failure and aggression against Russia by Western political elite. Remember how Obama called Russia a regional player, a gas station for the West. Arrogance comes before fall. In conclusion it becomes clear, that the above mentioned treaty became to a least important issue, till a new behavior strategy will be developed."

Neither country intended to stop the development of counter-tactical ABMs. The topic became disputable as soon as more potent counter-tactical ABMs started to be capable of shooting down SLBMs, nevertheless both sides continued counter tactical ABM development” “March 23, 1983 President Reagan announced the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a research program into ballistic missile defence which would be “consistent with our obligations under the ABM Treaty” - sounds similar to the recent statement made in the NPR: “the United States is commencing INF-Treaty compliant research and development by reviewing military concepts and options for conventional, ground-launched, intermediate range missile systems.

Due to its success, like any other treaty, both sides will try to maintain participation into the treaty until all other options are exhausted. Despite the recent perceived violations by Russia in its testing of the 9M729, it is still not a substantial attack for the treaty and there are still options left to bring Russia back into compliance. Among the most important of these options is the Special Verification Commission. Recently, Russia has criticized the United States in its deployment of the Aegis Ashore launchers, by stating that the United States was in breach of the treaty as the launchers could carry prohibited missiles. The Commission could work by allowing inspectors to view both weapons and determine their capabilities, which would be a great sign of mutual respect. In addition, the US could pressure its allies into ensuring that the INF treaty remains a top priority on their agenda in their discussions with delegates of Russia. In summation, long term successful treaties are usually held until all options are exhausted, and the INF treaty should be no different as both sides have options for resolving disputes."

Since the treaty’s signing in 1987 by Reagan and Gorbachev, the treaty has been responsible for a fair portion of nuclear capability disarmament, such as banning ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 300 and 3,300 miles. As a result, 2,700 missiles and launchers have been destroyed by both countries. Recent developments have made it more difficult for either country to remain committed to the treaty’s premise. Russia has violated the treaty by deploying a prohibited ground-launched cruise missile. This action violates the treaty’s prohibitions on producing, flight-testing, and possessing intermediate-range ground-launched missile. On the other hand, Russia has claimed that the US has violated the treaty by possessing launchers for missile interceptors in Romania and Poland. This is just another spat, although having potentially catastrophic consequences, in an increasingly East-West divide that is slowly taking shape. One can not assume that the Trump and Putin administrations will employ any logical reason other than avoiding another Cold War that would stifle both economies. With Trump’s bravado and Putin’s expansionist views, anything is possible at this point; therefore, I am submitting a 10% valuation on the probability of this event occurring. https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/12/08/the-looming-end-of-the-inf-treaty/"

48637,2018-02-03T13:09:01Z,1,[20.0],[20.0],"I give this outcome a 1 in 5 chance of occurring. From its conception, the INF's value was as much (if not more) symbolic than it was strategic. It did not serve to fully eliminate the ability of either the US or Russia to strike any given target on the planet with some form of nuclear weapon. Long range ICBMs, sea-based vehicles, and strategic bombers could still allow for this capability. As such the value in the INF was largely as a symbolic agreement continuing a (somewhat disingenuous) trend toward disarmament as well as a cost saving measure for both parties. If one is faced with evaluating the likelihood of either party suspending the agreement, the first step is to assess what would be gained. In my estimation, just as the value in entering it was largely symbolic, the main possibilities for leaving it would also be based in some type of symbolism. The United States has a president and congress who may increasingly find themselves in a position where appearing to be strong in opposition to Russia on anything will be politically useful. Additionally, Russia has grown increasingly brazen in its willingness to break international agreements and understandings without any realistic expectation of rebuke. As such a US suspension of the INF could serve as a means for the US administration/congress to appear to be anti-Russia and publicly admonish Russian aggressive behavior in context that is not likely to be particularly impactful. Both have implemented programs that are fundamental violations of the INF, if not in its wording in its spirit. Given that there has, to this point, been no repudiation for these violations, it is hard to see that there is any great strategic value in leaving the INF. For this reason as well as the fact that most observers (in the US particularly) don't rate the INF high on their list of important international agreements, making it weak as a symbolic token of defiance against Russia make it less likely to be used in this manner. The wild card nature of President Trump forces one to increase any assessment of what is remotely possible though which is why I made this outcome as likely as I did."
49173,2018-02-03T05:43:51Z,1,[26.0],[26.0],"I give a 26% chance for this event because I think Russia could use unrelated events to pull out of the treaty such as U.S. arms exports to Ukraine, the new U.S. nuclear strategy, or the Mueller investigation into Russian election meddling."
48643,2018-02-03T01:15:46Z,1,[20.0],[20.0],"This is a dangerous and uncertain time for the US and the world. Russia may be violating the treaty. Some experts say there should be technical talks between the US and Russia to discuss and de-escalate - but with US State Dept capacity extremely low at this point in time, I don't think that's likely. Also, Trump may very well want to withdraw from the treaty, as he has already declared his intention to withdraw from other landmark treaties. And Republicans are not pushing back. So I can definitely see potential for Trump (who said in the SOTU, ""we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal"") to use the Russia situation to withdraw from the INF. This could well be something Putin wants. Once the US is out, Russia is easily out at well. Both countries would then rebuild intermediate and short-range missiles -- weapons that China and North Korea have -- and claim that whatever they are doing is for deterrence. I think there's a 30% chance of this happening within a year, so I give it a 20% chance of happening by 1 October."

The utility of the INF Treaty as it currently exists: missile technology has advanced significantly since 1987 such that the subsection of weapons it was designed to prohibit (approximately 500-1000km) can now be launched by other means not explicitly covered by the INF treaty - namely by sea. If the current canvas of missile capabilities can be launched in ways that bypass the INF treaty, one would then have to consider the principle strength of the INF Treaty to be the fact that it reflects a moment of solidarity in time rather than a functional agreement that limits certain types of missiles."
