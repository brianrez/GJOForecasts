Both campaigns have seen sufficient crises to be motivated to vote, but this is a very unusual election. Perhaps there will be a Nov. 28 effect, (Trump misstating the voting date, his request that people vote in person and do not mail their ballots, or the NRA's joke about voting on the 8th or 9th depending on whether you are pro or against gun control). Another scenario is that Trump's most vocal voters are new and won't be comfortable with the process. I'm reducing from 10 percent based on the polls which are likely to be fairly accurate today, but staying at 6% in case logistics or motivation have a major effect."

At the Mid - Point between decennial census counts(which is used to set the base line by pollsters). And what i suspect will be a surprise every 48 hrs from now till the 8th. Traditionally the election day turnout mirrors the early voting which is a dead heat as ideologues turn out, and for the HRC trend to be turned we would have to see a Reaganesq turnout by the silent majority - which looks like it may happen, but the Reagan election was a vote FOR someone and this election may be remembered as a election decided by those voting AGAINST someone. Then there is this record heatwave which will only be abating on election day. It will be one for the Political Science departments to mull over for years."
