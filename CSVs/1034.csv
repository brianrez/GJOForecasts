Given the data, it's hard to tell if this is exponential growth or linear. A time series regression of log(cost) ~ year has the best fit for all possible transformations (R^2 = .9) and posits a 27% increase in each year, with a predicted value of 3 billion, with a 95% CI of 1.8 to 5.3 billion."

Factors that could reduce victim losses are the various counter measures (2 step authentication, bio-metric credit cards etc among a host of other measures), awareness campaigns, crack down on hacking groups, closure of dark web market places selling malware etc. 2018 reported figure for victim losses is 2.7 billion. I do not know what has caused a dip in 2017. However, I expect increased victim losses to the tune of 3 billion (a 10% increase in losses) in 2019~2020 at a 70% confidence level. The likelihood of a drop in victim losses (compared to 2018) or an increase in losses beyond 3.5 billion is considered to be 10% (or less). 3.5 billion to 4.5 billion or more victim loss could result from a major hack on a credit card issuing company or a super market chain or a major breach of corporate or a bank site. A 10% probability is assigned to this."
