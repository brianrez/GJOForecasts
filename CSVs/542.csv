ADA has maintained a price > $1 since early February (4 months) and, while the price has been dropping since its ATH, is not dropping that quickly. Therefore, assuming a stable rate of deprecation, the price will stay above $1 until July. On-top of this Cardano is rolling out smart contracts which will increase the number of users and should result in an increase of price. I don't believe the price will increase drastically to $2.50 (it's too tightly coupled to Bitcoin) but this may help slow down or reverse the ongoing price drop."

Of course, all the crypto is extremely volatile, so hard to say what will happen. It could double or halve between now and then. But, notably, halving still keeps it in the $1.00 to $2.50 range.

Para realizar esta predicción me base en los siguientes puntos: - Cardano se presenta a sí misma como una moneda de tercera generación, una moneda de primera generación es el Bitcoin, y una de segunda es el Ethereum. Por lo que esta nueva generación intenta suplir los errores que se cometieron en las monedas anteriores. - El creador de Cardano es Charles Hoskinson, quien es cofundador de Ethereum y BitShares, por lo que claramente es un equipo con mucha experiencia en monedas de este tipo, que tiene una moneda, como lo es el Ethereum, que ya está siendo exitosa. - El proceso de creación de la moneda busca que esta sea mucho más descentralizada que las dos monedas más exitosas del mercado, y de esta manera, le da mayor seguridad y solidez. - El algoritmo sobre el cual está hecho Cardano es mucho más eficiente energéticamente que los algoritmos anteriormente conocidos, por lo que le permite realizar transacciones más rápidas y sea más amigable con el medio ambiente. - Sin embargo, la secuencia de etapas que los administradores de Cardano tienen pensadas, necesariamente se deben hacer con tiempo, por lo que en los próximos 3 meses creo que no sufrirá subidas tan abruptas. - Además, agrego un leve porcentaje a una caída en el precio, ya que elementos tan volátiles como lo son las criptomonedas, pueden sufrir este tipo de bajadas en sus precios"
