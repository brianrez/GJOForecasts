Aggregates weekly polls from 7 polling institutes, weighting each according to historical accuracy and adjusting for possible political bias. Using their 80% prediction interval as of 11.09.17 (AfD result to fall between 7.7% and 10.9%) I read off corresponding probabilities for results in the 0-5%, 5-10%, 10-15% and 15%+ brackets. Additional data points considered: 1. Previous Bundestag elections: of very limited use as the AfD has only contested one previous election (2013). Since then the AfD has radically overhauled its policy platform and leadership to the extent it is practically a different party. Seeking a ""cut-off point"" for the purposes of this prediction, I would say the AfD in its current form ""dates"" from Frauke Petry's assumption of the party leadership in July 2015 (https://www.ft.com/content/456815bc-9291-11e7-a9e6-11d2f0ebb7f0). 2. Landtag elections: data too limited to have much predictive power but of some use as a sense check. In total the AfD has contested 14 Landtag elections, each in a different Land. 6 of these fell before its radical policy shift in July 2015 so I would say these are of very limited use for this forecast. The remaining 8 elections span the period March 2016 - May 2017: - differences between Laender: ignored for the purposes of this very simplistic sense check. I understand the Land electoral systems are broadly similar to the Bundestagwahl (i.e. based on overall voting proportions) and that AfD support has not tended to cluster strongly by geography (https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/afd-waehler-101.html) - time trend: the 8 election results follow a broad trend similar to national polling (per weekly poll aggregates) with the highest results in autumn 2016 and a fall back into the single digits in 2017. Supports the view that the best predictors of AfD vote share are events and trends at the national level. The simple average of the three 2017 Landtag election results is 6.5%: in the 5-10% range. 3. Possible events between now and 24 September, not factored into today's polls, which could affect AfD result: a) Events which would affect AfD support directly: - generally difficult to predict given AfD voting patterns not yet well-understood (https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/afd-waehler-101.htmlb). The rise in AfD support in autumn 2015 continuing into 2016 was associated with the migration crisis and policy response by the German government. However, a significant change in this policy area between now and 24 September is very unlikely. b) Events which would affect other parties' support and indirectly affect AfD's share of the vote: - too difficult to predict. AfD votes have not been drawn overwhelmingly from former supporters of any one party so an event increasing or reducing support for another party would not have a clear knock-on effect on AfD support."

Although I am not aware of them arriving in Germany (I believe they are stuck in Italy) but Italy has requested EU assistance and for other EU counties to share the burden. As some of aid agencies that are accused of encouraging people to attempt to cross from Libya to Italy have German connections the story will be known in Germany. (The accusation is that the aid agency's ships are located just off the Libyan coast which encourages the people smugglers to send migrants out to the ships in boats that could not get to Italy.) Whatever happens the EU and Germany will become involved and this might boost support for AfD. Following previous patterns this support could increase over the summer and fade in September (but I do not know what caused the pattern before, so could be wrong)."

Each country saw slight differences in when the high point was reached but by mid-2017 it can be seen that AfD's percentage had fallen from around a high point of around 14% a year ago to about 7% now. In the last 3 months it dropped by about 30%. If that trend continued at the same rate they would get about 5% on election day. Of course there is no reason to assume that the trend will continue or that it will be at the same rate. As the German election nears and campaigns start the changes are likely to be more volatile.

What gives me pause is the complexity of the electoral system (article 2), in which a voter can vote for a candidate (say, from CDU) for their district, but then cast the second vote for a party (say, AfD). This could allow for a party like AfD to potentially exceed polling expectations, especially if the populist trend isn't well-captured by the polls."

As noted, recent polling (first link below) mostly indicates upper single digit support for AfD. Another quoted poll result (third link, from 3/10/17) found support at 11%. FWIW, nationalist, anti-immigrant Donald Trump's general unpopularity (esp. in Europe?) plus Angela Merkel's push-back (with him/his admin.) could help boost Merkel; possibly hinder AfD(?)
