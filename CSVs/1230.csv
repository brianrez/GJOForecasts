Maduro praising anything relating to the US (""dollarization"") seems odd - especially since it's a repudiation of the use of the bolivar as the nation's currency - indicates to me a man more at ease than conditions would otherwise suggest. Guaido's followers seem tired - recent marching more akin to ""once more unto the breach, dear friends""? And all is not well in La Paz post-Evo - with fuel blockages and military interventions and 20+ deaths - I'm not sure Venezuelans (civilians and military) want any part of that. I have a sense the opposition has chosen to wait him out for the rest of 2019. So I've dropped my percentage for a pre-2020 departure (departure by force unlikely) but still feel there's more than a slight chance of pre-2020 departure from self-exile (those now-aborted August/Sept Oslo negotiations have left in their wake back-channel communications) All this is speculation, regrettably. There appeared precious little from public sources that was relevant."

The resulting pictures and sounds of unrest in Bolivia probably makes real to the Venezuelan military what an uncoordinated removal from power looks and sounds and smells like. It may also encourage those who resist the government that, if they act in similar manner, similar outcome is possible. While the military is probably still in Maduro's corner - they've also had another 8 months of behind-the-scenes pressures and incentives to act. And we now know that Maduro may have safe haven - Mexico. Speculation had always been Cuba - but I wonder if the Cuban government didn't give mixed signals as they weighed the likelihood and severity of more approbations from the US if they took in Maduro. Now there's a different glide path in evidence. Having a place to go always makes it easier to leave........"

They are attempting to find a solution to the political deadlock that has gripped the country for the last six months. The talks, which are mediated by Norway, are likely to be dominated by questions over the timing and framing of new presidential elections: namely whether President Maduro, widely accused of having rigged last year’s poll, would stand down in advance of any vote, and what the composition of the national electoral council will be. Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader who is recognised as interim president by most western democracies, has been criticised by some of his would-be supporters for falling into a “trap” of talking to representatives of a clique that has little intention of giving up power. His response is that the unpopular and nearly bankrupt Maduro government is much weaker than it might appear.“"

However, the tension is so high in the country that any unexpected event could generate a chain reaction ending with Maduro ceasing to be president, which is why I think there is a small possibility this could happen in 2019."

Guaidò (the leading opposer) has been isolated by Maduro and his fellows have not reached and many of Maduro opponents have abandoned the country. The international community is not giving anymore attention to the Venezuela situation, and the EU is simply pushing for a peaceful solution. Moreover, in the last days Maduro has signed an agreement with Huawei about improving 4G connection. This choice would have a twofold effect: linking even more Venezuela with Chine, a country that has always supported Maduro, and, above all, allows Maduro, in the long-term, to control even better the local communication networks. According to these facts (and the fact we are already at half June) I reshape drastically my forecast, predicting that Maduro won’t cease to be President in the short-term. However, in case of big changes during the second half on 2019, I assess to 10% the probability of Maduro ceasing to be president between 1 october and 31 december."

The research program has identified six variables that are indicative of the potential of regime overthrow. The variables are the following: 1. The time in which a leader has been in power (Longer leadership = higher risk of coup) 2. The time a regime has been in power (Younger regimes = higher risk of coup) 3. When the last attempt at a coup was (Little time since last coup = high risk of a re-attempt) 4. Defeat in election (Recent defeat = higher risk of coup) 5. Weather conditions (Extreme weather that interfere with agriculture or market dynamics = increased risk of coup) 6.

The president’s dissatisfaction has crystallized around national security adviser John Bolton and what Trump has groused is an interventionist stance at odds with his view that the United States should stay out of foreign quagmires. Trump has said in recent days that Bolton wants to get him “into a war” — a comment that he has made in jest in the past but that now betrays his more serious concerns, one senior administration official said.

I forecasted that there was an opportunity to overthrow Maduro in the coming weeks, and if this was unsuccessful it was likely that Maduro would remain in power until the end of the year. More than a week after the incident, there is no reason to believe that the military has ultimately decided to back Guaidò, and it appears his momentum has depleted.

The fact that international actors are taking interest in what happens next, makes the situation also very unclear and hard to forecast. The USA has expressed an extreme willingness to aid the military take control of the government, Vice President Pence just today offered what he called ""carrots"" to the military if they were to take more action (source: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-usa-exclusive/exclusive-pence-to-offer-carrots-to-venezuela-military-warnings-to-judges-idUSKCN1SD03T). It is also believed that he will warn President Maduro that the U.S. will take further action to cripple his government. Reuters also state that President Trump has used a lot of political capital in regards to the situation, which means that he sees a finale end goal, for himself and the U.S., and is very likely to take drastic steps to reach these goals. With that being said, we do not no just how far he is willing to go, which like mentioned before makes the situation unclear. This is also reflected in my percentages, which at this point remains almost equally spread across the options, as I find the situation at this point unclear. The percentages do on the other hand lean more towards Maduro being removed in the close future, this is because the situation is very unstable and the fact that Guaido not only has international support, but also seem to have a somewhat strong hold in the public and the military."

This week Juan Guaidó, who is recognised as interim president by many democracies, has vowed to keep up the pressure. Workers could be asked to join a “staggered strike”; expect further calls for mass street protests. But support for both may be lacklustre. Many Venezuelans, however much they despise Mr Maduro, are showing signs of protest fatigue. Turnout for demonstrations outside military bases over the weekend was thin. So diplomacy could move centre stage. America’s secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, will discuss Venezuela with Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, this week in Finland. Mr Maduro meanwhile will probably keep repeating his message that the army remains loyal. But he should be nervous. At least three of his senior aides have reportedly been in detailed discussions with the opposition over how to depose him.“"

Yesterday, Guaidò called for an uprising against Maduro at a military base in the capital. This is an instrumental step in the Venezuelan crisis, illustrating increasing military support for Guaidò. As described in previous forecasts, Maduro's military backing to date has been a critical component in his capacity to remain in power. It was determined in the same forecasts that for Maduro to cease to be president before January 1st 2020, it would most likely be the outcome of a successful military coup. With an evident shift in military backing, and Guaidò's apparent ability to mobilise action, a successful coup now seems more possible than ever. The forecast is adjusted to account for Guaidò's current momentum and the prospect of more military personnel switching sides -- that Maduro ceases to be president before June 30 is forecasted to be 40%. But given Maduro's ability to withstand major crises and the statistical unlikelihood of a successful coup, if he is able to survive the coming weeks it is likely he will endure until the end of the year. Thus, the prospect of Maduro being removed after July 1 and before December 31 is considered highly likely -- given 3% and 2% respectively per time frame. 55% is given to the final option, that Maduro will still be president at the end of the year -- this has been lowered from previous evaluations to account for the increasing possibility that Maduro will be removed in the coming weeks."

Indeed, in my previous forecasts I was doubtful about Maduro ceasing to be president of Venezuela before January 2020, because he has been able to hold on the power so far and because he has always had the militaries on its side. As I said, the support of the army makes the difference in such contexts. But now, part of the militaries have shifted to Guaidò side. I'm trying to understant what I've misanderstood in my previous evaluations: I might have taken too much for granted the loyalty of the whole army to Maduro and/or its ability in being able to overpass the peak of the crisis.. yes, he has been resilient so far, but seems that now its credibility is failing. However, there are not yet enough information about the group of militaries supporting Guaidò: maybe it'll turn out they are only a few, not enough for a successful coup d'état. The ones i reported are the latest news and there is not evidence of Guaido's chances to succeed. Moreover, both sides have interest in claiming that the militaries supporting Guaidò are or are not a lot, in order to encourage or discourage civilians in engaging the rebellion against Maduro, so the information could be quite misleading. Waiting for the next news, I modify my predictions but remaining skeptical and cautious. I'll keep a eye on the news in the next days.

He is supported by the majority of the venezuelan people ( even if partially forced ). The next US president will be elected in November 2020. So this is way after the mentioned date above. Trump is unable to lead a putsch against Maduro, since Russia is supporting Venezuela with armed forces and covered operations. An intervention in Venezuela will likely be a disaster for Trump. The only way for a regime change would be a new elected president in America. Someone who is more connected with the military leadership. Someone who is more agressive and willing to raise a conflict with Russia. There are plenty of candidates that would fit this position. But it all will take place way after 1 January 2020."

This event demonstrates the collapse of the Venezuelan health system, and food and electricity shortages now commonplace, and in general describes a serious situation which is still at the peak of the crisis. For these reasons, i keep my prediction about Maduro ceasing of being president between 1 April and 30 June at 15%. However, EU has not yet announce a common and shared by all the eu members declaration against Maduro. Putin has sent military planes to support the president through the airspace of Greece and Cyprus from Syria en route to Venezuela on March 22 and 23. Even if the more recent Russia request to use Malta airspace to sent other planes has been rejected, it's evident the concrete Russian endorsement Maduro. Moreover, I think that Russian help can be a deterrent for countries as US, in order to dis-courage the american military intervention and a ""change regime"" in the next months (as occurred in Syria for Assad before ISIS defeat). In addition, considering a comparison with the Syrian situation, Assad has faced a big crisis in its country in the last years but has been able to maintain its power, also thanks to the Russian backing. Surely, the two situations are different, but I see very likely a similar outcome. Again, if Maduro will be able to overpass this super critical period, I expect him to be able to resist at least after 1 January 2020 (75%). I keep the others two options at 5% because the actors in the framework are a lot and can have unpredictable reactions, so it's impossible to exclude completely any scenario."

Further, all leaders face threats from shocks such as downturns in their health, their country’s economy, or their government’s revenue. By integrating these risks into the selectorate theory, we characterize the conditions under which each threat is pertinent and the countermoves (purges, democratization, expansion of public goods, and expansion of private benefits) that best enable the leader to survive in office. The model identifies new insights into the nature of assassins; the relative risk of different types of leader removal as a function of the extant institutions of government; and the endogenous factors driving better or worse public policy and decisions to democratize or become more autocratic. Importantly, the results highlight how an increase in the risk of deposition via one means intensifies other removal risks From: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022002715603100?journalCode=jcrb"

First, military support. I think the military plays a huge role in helping Maduro to stay in power. Even though a multilateral body called Lima Group expects that their proposed sanctions against military officials will force them to turn their backs to the president, I wouldn't consider that sanctions would have such high efficiency. It might have an effect on changing opinions of some individuals though. Another issue is fragmented and divided opposition. Hence, there is not a huge danger coming from political opponents. Third, it is obvious that Maduro is strongly pressed by the UN, EU. United States even recognised opposition leader Juan Guaidó as interim leader. However, there are such countries like Russia and China (often and Turkey) that usually are very willing to take a stand against Europe and the United States while supporting dictatorships. Fourth, and probably the hardest thing to admit, after some time countries are very likely to get tired of pressuring Venezuela and step back. Annexed Crimea's case and Venezuela's situation are not very familiar. However, it shares the same IR practice. Even though in the case of annexed Crimea, Russia is still facing sanctions, we can see that the situation is almost normalised. Therefore, that would be my guess for Venezuela as well. Military intervention is very unlikely in this case."

Experts warn that sporadic blackouts may continue indefinitely, placing the country on the verge of 'social implosion' (New York Times, 11 March 2019). While the security forces still align with Maduro, new revelations may push more military members to defect. For this reason the forecast has been adjusted, accounting for an increased likelihood of a military coup after April 1. However, given their loyalty, it is still considered most likely that Maduro will not cease to be president before January 1, 2020."

These facts decrease the probability that Maduro will remain in power. I have given the remaining options nearly the same probabilities, with the differences accounting for me assuming that the pressure for Maduro either to step down voluntarily or be forced out will continue to grow slightly with time if conditions in Venezuela remain as they are, which seem likely. I have Included the option of a US intervention in the probabilities, which I judge to be very low. The US have not intervened militarily after the Cold War, but have instead relied on economic sanction or support."

This has lead to a call for a national emergency by Juan Guadio and his supporters, this has to this date not been implemented. I am also considering the fact that Maduro is refusing to even negotiate his position as President, leading to more protesters taking to the street, which again has meant that Maduro has increased the police presence in the streets. People are growing more impatient with Maduro, especially following the blackouts and the lack of action taken to fix the issue, increasing tensions. From where I stand it seems that the people will not tolerate much more of Maduro's power play, and the situation could escalate quickly (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/venezuela-crisis-latest-updates-190123205835912.html).

For this reason, I assess that there is only a very little chance (2%) that Maduro will be overturned before April 21, which is in less than one month. In order to have such an outcome, it would be necessary an International intervention. In this regard, Although Trump recently stated that a military option for Venezuela was ""not off the table”, before to play the military card the U.S.A would have to face a strong debate, both at the internal and international level. Indeed, the reputation of American interventionism has been strongly affected by the inconclusive and controversial external actions undertaken in recent years (e.g. Iraqi invasion). For this reason, at the internal level, before to intervein Trump would have to convince the parliament that it won’t be the umpteenth huge financial loss without any final benefit in return. At the external level, the Trump’s administration would have to convince the international community that is not another “American attempt of imperialism in the name of democracy” as over the years has been increasingly argued. Furthermore, on a side note, in order to legally legitimize such intervention, a motion should pass in the UN Security Council, where the Russian Federation detain (and is likely to use) the veto power. Yet, there is still the “Uniting for peace” motion (a formula which permits the UN General Assembly to allow a humanitarian intervention in case of an impasse in the Security Council), however it has rarely been used since the born of the United Nation. Therefore, the actual likelihood of American intervention, at least in the short term, is basically low. A fortiori since Russia is defending Nicolas Maduro‘s claim to the presidency in Venezuela and has strong interests in the region. What is more probable is that both Russia and the USA will indirectly sustain the two factions engaging a sort of new proxy War. However, even if such an outcome unfolded, it would require a long and bloody process before a radical political change happens (as it is the case of Assad in Syria who, despite 8 years of civil and proxy war, still holds the power)."

Today it is 28 February 2019, that is, there is one month left for Maduro to cease to be president of Venezuela. In my opinion, this is the less likely option. Indeed, Maduro seems to remain particularly determined to keep his power, for now. He is using of repression against his population/opponents and is still benefiting from strong pillars of Venezuelan power. In addition, this crisis is undergoing a spillover on the international scene and provides the United States and Russia with the opportunity to continue their historic and endless arm wrestling in international affairs. If the United States are supporting Guaido and are currently working on the allocation of humanitarian aid to Venezuela, Putin had previously agreed on an economic and military support with Maduro. In that sense, it is more likely that both sides remain to the stage of diplomatic interpositions in the next weeks, leaving a room for Maduro to keep his power in this period of time. For instance, if Trump declared that he did not exclude the option for a military intervention, I believe that four weeks is too short for stepping foot in Venezuela as the endeavours will firstly remain focused on the allocation of humain aid."

He is caring a lot about the part of international community which have recognised Guaidò as president, in spite of its self-proclamation. The reasons why he is in the condition to behave in this way are the national military support and the political and economic support that he receives from Russia, China and Turkey. Indeed, to face the sanctions that US have imposed on Venezuela, the government is exporting oil to other states like China and India. Moreover, Venezuela is importing from Russia the chemicals necessary to make the petrol enough fluid to flow through pipelines: in the past, Venezuela was used to buy this material from the US but now Russia can fill the gap. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-47239060"

First of all, international and internal consensus is fading away. Internationally, the number of States which decided to actively support a line of action in Venezuela is increasigly both on Guaidò's side - USA - or on new elections' side - EU. Internally, Maduro's decision not to accept the majority of the external aid - wether economic or in food and medical supplies - is enhancing the protests. Even so, we don't have to forget Maduro's ability in maintaining power with powerful international - Russia, Cuba, China - and internal - police and military - allies (https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2017/05/10/why-is-venezuelas-nicolas-maduro-still-in-power ) Moreover, US explicit line against Maduro (in Mike Pompeo's word, his days are numbered, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-47348293 ) sounds a lot like an incoming coup. If this possibility will be enforced, we can assume that it's more likely as time passes and the situation get worse. Finally, I would say that, given the delicate situation, a ""solution"" on Venezuela's situation will take its time, or no time. Maduro is strongly committed in not letting Trojan horses enter his country and not organizing elections. I think the two most probable outcomes are an immediate retaliation against Maduro - coup, or, as already happening, economic sanctions such as increased oil exchange rates - in the immediate future (before the 1st of April) or a longer stall that eventually will depose him. I might as well put a 20% probability in each time lapse, but I think the immediate and the longer term Maduro's deposition are slighlty more probable."

My original forecast end loaded Maduro's end date on the reasoning that as conditions worsened he would be more likely to lose power. With recent developments, I have front loaded forecast. However, if the Maduro administration survives this crisis it may last much longer. Finally, ceasing to be president is not clearly defined. It could be said to have occurring at present with international recognition of Guairdo as interim president. Cessation could be defined as when a new president is inaugurated, which could push the date as late as 1 July. However, if the definition is when Maduro recognizes the legitimacy of a new president, he will cease to be ""the President of Venezuela on the day he dies.

The one with the legitimacy is Juan Guaidó, a 35-year-old politician chosen as head of the country’s national assembly earlier this month, who on January 23rd declared himself acting president. Mr Guaidó was swiftly recognised by other countries: President Donald Trump was the first to endorse him; Canada and all the major economies in South America followed. Growing protests are evidence that Mr Guaidó also has the backing of most Venezuelans, even those from the poorest neighbourhoods of Caracas, where hunger and anger have overcome the fear of the regime. But Mr Guaidó cannot yet claim to have the support of the army. It will ultimately decide which president prevails."

Dictators are generally quite good at keeping power as long as they can spread benefits to allies who help them maintain their power, so Maduro has to keep his allies rolling in the cash from oil, drugs and other illicit activities, but the danger for him is the people who are excluded from this in the military. But they face enormous challenges even if a potential coup succeeds, which may well dissuade them from doing it. (restoring order, fixing the economy, getting control of assets like oil production, dealing with Russia, China and the US as well as people who are about to lose out from the status quo).

The only real risk now is a military coup but that seems unlikely given the extensive privileges the military has and the presence of Cuban and other spies monitoring soldiers' loyalty. If anything the people pouring out of the country make Maduro more secure since many of the people leaving are presumably opposed to him.

At 56 years old, a life insurer would see about 0.85% risk of death from now until 2020. I would say Maduro's risk is maybe 5 times that, plus a slim chance that he could cease to be president due to political opposition. There is no saying when that might happen, so spreading evenly across 2019, and the remaining probability goes to 2020 and beyond."
