When the Metropolitan Police report and the full Sue Gray investigation is released there will be more pressure and members may seek to send letters, likewise if the Conservatives return poor results in the May local elections, or lose flagship councils like Wandsworth (where Johnson ally Lord Lister was leader.) The fact remains that there may be Conservatives who have withdrawn letters since the height of Partygate in May. There's a chance that a few letters may tip the balance over the requisite number after the above three moments in time. I think however, there is a marginally greater possibility that there will be a significant groundswell of opposition should things in Ukraine turn more sour, combined with party fallout, which means that if there is a vote of no-confidence, the Prime Minister is more likely to lose than win. On the whole, though, the greater likelihood is that if Ukraine persists, Johnson will survive 2022."

That seems to me the biggest risks at the moment for Boris Johnson, and these are in my estimate really hard to predict. A new scandal from his past, not unreasonable to expect, and if it happen than it has to be something of quite an order of magnitute (as an example, I thinking about something like Prince Andrew in cahoots with Jeffrey Epstein). To be clear, this is only a comparison for the sole purpose of illustrating my thoughts of what, in my estimation, would be big enough to bring down the current prime minister. And as long Boris Johnson is sitting the current affairs out, he will also get more scandal proof, because the people working for him and resigning are going to be replaced by more loyal ones. It also seems at the moment the tories don't have a clear alternative to replace him, at least nobody so far who can rally enough support.

I'm currently at 100% on Boris leaving before the 23rd of June (https://www.gjopen.com/questions/2233-before-23-june-2022-will-boris-johnson-cease-to-be-prime-minister-of-the-united-kingdom) so I'm primarily treating this question as a question about how Boris will leave. I don't expect Boris to resign of his own will, so 75% on him losing a vote of no confidence that I think he could lose as long as Tories can think of a viable successor i.e., if Sunak, Truss or some other Tory makes a case to their colleagues (as they have presumably been doing in the background). 20% he manages to survive a vote of no confidence, but does not do so with a comfortable enough majority and resigns whe thinks get even worse e.g., after big losses in the May elections. 5% on him not facing a vote of no confidence e.g., if he resigns after the May elections before being forced out by a vote of no confidence."
