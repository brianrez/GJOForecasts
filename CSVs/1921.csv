The trial will come to a close this week and according to BBC, 52 senators have declared that they will vote for her impeachment. This means that only two more out of the 29 senators will be needed to confirm her impeachment. With this I increase my percentage by 40% leaving me at 69%. Also, because the majority of Brazil is against Rousseff, even if she survives the vote and is reinstated, there is a possibility that she could resign afterward. She has already stated that she would bring a reelection sooner than usual so as to remove the corruption from the government. With this I increase my percentage by 15%. Regardless, I will be waiting for Dilma's defense speech and the reaction of the senators to see if any other changes are necessary."

With a Senate panel clearing her of manipulating budget figures - one of the major charges against her - there's more reason for a few Senators who initially voted against her to change their minds. To recap, the vote against her was 55-22, just two more than the 54 required to get two thirds of the 81 Senators. If she does cease to be President because of the Senate, it'll be due to her unpopularity, not because of anything she's done.

Barring a major upswing in popular sentiment, she's done. That the impeachment trial has been prioritized by Temer's politburo is, I think, a sign of either fear or desperation. I really didn't expect it to happen so soon, but it does seem likely that the longer this drags on, the better Rousseff's chances would be and that possibility is clearly to be avoided at all costs. Is the plan now to 'bury' the proceedings and verdict with a happy layer of Olympics fever? There is still a reasonable chance that Dilma can avoid impeachment, but even so, where to from there? Forget the two-thirds majority for a guilty verdict - Rousseff would probably need close to a 50-50 split (highly unlikely) to be able to build a relatively effective presidency. I honestly don't know where Brazil goes from here. Impeachment won't be the end of the awkward questions and it's impossible to see Temer's ill-gotten government surviving another twelve months."

The Senate looks poised to begin her impeachment trial, ostensibly over dodgy government accounting, ignoring Monday’s abortive attempt by Waldir Maranhão, the acting lower-house speaker, to halt proceedings on procedural grounds. Brazilians are rightly fed up with Ms Rousseff’s economic ineptitude and with corruption in her Workers’ Party—indeed, with the whole self-serving political class. They want fresh faces. The main sweepers would be capable—Michel Temer, the canny vice-president who would take her place; Henrique Meirelles, a former central-bank governor, as finance chief; and José Serra, a senior opposition senator, as foreign minister—but they are in their 70s. Since 1985 the vice-president’s centrist (and hardly squeaky-clean) party has rarely been out of government. Brazilians can be forgiven their scepticism: just 8% think he will do a better job than Ms Rousseff"
