A deadline one year later would certainly be higher but there is simply insufficient time for Haiti to organize and hold elections by the beginning of 2022, less than 3 months away. Most notably, Haiti's Prime Minister, Ariel Henry, publicly stated that he plans to modify the Haiti constitution by February and then hold elections sometime early in the year after that.

Between January and July 2021, Panama registered more than 20,000 Haitians crossing the border, with more each month, up significantly from 2020 when numbers dropped due to the pandemic. Similar crises are taking place with thousands of Haitian migrants stuck in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico. Gang violence has directly contributed to the numbers of displaced people as well as other criminal economies, including child trafficking from Haiti to the Dominican Republic. “In Haiti, more than a failing state we have a non-existent state,” economist Joseph Harold Pierre told Bloomberg.

Before agreeing to investigate it, a judge thinks about his own safety and that of his family,” one judge told the AFP news agency on condition of anonymity this week. “For this reason, investigating magistrates are not too enthusiastic about accepting it.” Several magistrates have told the dean of the Court of First Instance in Port-au-Prince that they are not interested in working on the assassination. Senior magistrate Bernard Saint-Vil said he would announce on Thursday the name of the investigating magistrate chosen to take on the case, but in the end, he could not because no judge wanted the job.'"

The Parliament has not been functioning for the last 18 months having been ruled by decree by Moise and only ten sitting Senators, no deputies and the President of Haiti’s court died of Covid in June. The constitution is moribund. The choice of Prime Minister, selected by the President, has to be ratified by both Houses of the Legislature and that is not functioning. With no visible functioning arm of Government and a constitution in a state of flux, it will take considerable time and possible international assistance/intervention (perhaps the US) to formulate and organise an electoral process to allow for an election. https://theconversation.com/whos-running-haiti-after-presidents-assassination-5-questions-answered-164287"

I think a power struggle between Prime Minister Joseph and Dr. Henry is likely to continue until one of them is able to take and/or bargain for nearly all power for himself. The governing structure of the country is in such disarray that I think elections are unlikely before January 1, 2022. Whoever is in power might also claim that greater stability is needed before elections could be held. I think there might eventually be elections at some point in the next 1 to 3 years, but I think they will only happen when either PM Joseph or Dr. Henry (or some third person who manages to insert himself or herself into the power struggle) feels either forced to hold them or assured of victory. https://theconversation.com/whos-running-haiti-after-presidents-assassination-5-questions-answered-164287"
