Además de eso, la cantidad de muertes diarias es mucho mayor en la Unión Europea, registrándose más de 2800, mientras que en Estados Unidos no se registran más de 1000 muertes diarias desde marzo. Otro factor que consideré es con respecto a los procesos de vacunación que se están desarrollando en ambas partes. La campaña de vacunación en Estados Unidos ha sido bastante prolífica, con un 29,39% de la población ya vacunada. Mientras tanto, varios países de la EU no han llegado ni al 10% de la población vacunada y en general han sufrido de escasez de vacunas debido a problemas en la producción.

However, there is reason to believe that the EU will see a greater toll in 2021. First, underlying demographic factors will play a role. EU population (~447.5M) and population density (112 ppl/sq. km) are both higher than in the US (~328.2M & 36 ppl/sq. km) (data.WorldBank.org). Also, the EU population is older than the US population, providing a larger proportion and total number of people over age 65 that are susceptible to severe cases of COVID (EU - 20.3% vs. US - 15.2%). Additionally, the initial vaccine rollout int he US (7.1 doses administered per 100 ppl) has been more successful than in the EU (2.3 doses administered per 100 ppl), suggesting that vaccination will provide adequate levels of herd immunity in the US faster than in the EU. Additionally, more contagious strains of the virus seem more widespread in the EU at this point, although that will most likely soon even out in the US as the spread strains take hold in North America."

The EU has a larger and slightly older (therefore more vulnerable) population than the United States, and is currently leading the United States in deaths. The EU also has a lower vaccination rate. If rates of infection, vaccination, and death remain somewhat constant, it is reasonable to assume the EU would have more COVID-19 deaths at the end of 2021. While both the EU and the US will likely see vaccination rates increase as the vaccine supply expands and distribution becomes more efficient, I think it is unlikely that the EU's vaccination rate will significantly outpace that of the US. The EU will likely face some distribution challenges that the US will not, as vaccines need to be allocated and distributed across national borders."
