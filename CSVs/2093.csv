"Will North Korea launch a land based missile with the capacity to reach Alaska, Hawaii, or the continental United States before 1 January 2017?",2015-09-01T16:37:49Z,2016-02-06T22:00:38Z,Yes,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],1582,653,517,236,,https://www.gjopen.com/questions/8-will-north-korea-launch-a-land-based-missile-with-the-capacity-to-reach-alaska-hawaii-or-the-continental-united-states-before-1-january-2017
14493,2016-02-08T10:23:34Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],Many reports are that NK has already done this. The there are 2 questions here (a) did the missile have that range (b) are they planning another one. It seems probable that the answer to (a) is yes. The answer to (b) is that they are unlikely to do another trial this year
11800,2016-02-08T08:54:08Z,2,[85.0],[45.0],"with the latest launch of a satellite if we believe the comments like the one from CNN, than that was it! But NK has launched before a satellite into orbit and it was not considered a long range missile. Now lets see what the experts are saying after having analyzed the entire story including the debris fished out of the sea. I am only increasing my judgement to 80% because i judge the result a bit different than many of my colleagues herein the gjp. However I also trust that the likelihood is given that NK will test-launch more missiles during this year."

North Korea’s boasting is certainly no guide. For example, it is highly unlikely that the detonation in January involved a hydrogen bomb, which is more powerful than the atomic sort. The seismic signature of the test, in an underground complex near the border with China where earlier ones were conducted, suggested the device was similar in size to the one used in the previous test in 2013.

During the entire performance of what I'll call a ""missile medley,"" they were running video clips of missile launches. Even more disturbing, it looked like a scenario of an ICBM targeting the USA. If there were any doubts before as to North Korean intentions regarding missile capabilities, this video should dispel those. It seems they've selected missile technology as something which they've aligned with national culture and pride. If anything is holding North Korea back from another launch, it is only their own capability and readiness for testing. Any strategy of talking them off this is incomplete unless it includes substituting some other gigantic cultural meme in lieu of missile technology. I just never fully understood how they seemingly have embraced this, almost in the way the United States embraces the Fourth of July or something.

That is, not too long ago they published an analysis that described how North Korea has likely changed design of their long-range ballistic missile. In short, it was how they changed from a 3-stage to a 2-stage design. If you read their detailed report, beside estimating that the newer design would not be available for operational deployment until around 2020, they also (and here's the important point) made an estimate on how long it would take to actually begin testing of the newer design. As I recall, this estimate was beyond the horizon of this question. So, to answer this question affirmatively, you are, under at least my interpretation, going against the estimate provided by 38North. I'm going against their estimate not because I know it is wrong, only because I think that North Korea might possibly have multiple designs in-the-works, or is re-purposing portions of the old design into the new one, or something along those lines. The primary motivation for this is the spate of construction improvements at their primary launch facility (as reported even earlier by 38North), completed late last year. I do not see why these launch facility modifications would be completed in late 2015 if the earliest they would be needed was not until 2017. I would encourage you to access the 38North report and read their words as to the estimate of earliest testing of the new design, and make up your own minds."

Khan.Pakistan shared the capacity and technology and parts.Pakistan warheads and missiles also come from China. So North Korea has at least the capacity and perhaps inventory of 3 Pakistan IRB. Now given that NOrth Korea. demonstrated such a capability in a trajectory over Japan...it would be wise to wager even this ruthless dilettante was predicted by us sources 6 months ago to be within a year Times up they probably have the capability to and face no costs we know of from China from using it. Probably granulated is 2 to 1. Otherwise the Chinese face regime collapse and a flood of 20-million angry hungry refugees. China stuck with North Korea. We are too...Short of an attack like Israel under Shamir pulled off at Saddams Osirak facilities and pulled off against Iraq with no SA 300. North Korea will probably do it.such a preemptive attack must be on table. attack may not be successful and start a nuclear war. This guy is still consolidating power purging telatives.how best to guarantee his regimes survival over awe all enemies. With his Fared Zakaria moonshot. He will try.and the North Koreansi have the approximate level of technology Mao had for his first intercontinental ballistics with nuke warheads and they have been working on it for 20 years launched a satellite. At some point they will get it done asap due to US election, Iran testing ballistics Russia launching errant or accurate cruise missiles from floating movable platforms in Caspian. The trend among absolute dictators like Mao and Kim III is to starve the peasants to keep the hard gotten foreign exchange. And build a ICBM that could reach 5000-8000 nautical miles. So who knows but for this extended projection for now assume it will be so. As the time horizon narrows might get more granulated. A story. There is a counter narrative cited at top. Tough question"

Pyongyang has indicated in the recent past that both satellite development and nuclear development will be increased and serve as a larger geopolitical strategy. Interesting to note; analysts estimated that a new satellite would be launch by NK by Oct. 10th to coincide with NK's 70th anniversary of the founding of its ruling Worker's Party. That time has passed, so perhaps NK is re-assessing its confrontation with S. Korea in light of recent diplomatic exchanges.

North Korea almost always inflates its military arsenal and capabilities making basic assumptions concerning their technical capacities all the more difficult to assess, even for the IC. Two technical aspects need to be unpacked if an accurate estimation is to be given provided the constraints of open and dated information; i) Does NK have a land-based missile(s)?, and ii) do any of these 'land-based missile(s)' have the theoretical capability to reach Alaska/Hawaii/continental US? The first question can be answered with a high degree of certainty according to various open sources. The second question appears to be answered, but only slightly. According to the Center for Arms Control & Non-Proliferation' Fact Sheet, NK is alleged to have a medium-range missile capable of reaching the continental US (Taepodong-1 and/or Rodong / Nodong-1). The missile was tested in 1998 with partial success. But the Taepodong-2 is currently under development with the capacity to reach any of the stated countries and was tested five times between 2006 -2013 (as noted by @sanxiyn). @sanxiyn gives a high forecast of 75% (w/ justification), but this does not take into account varying changes in geopolitical relationships which could change the regime's calculus in the meantime. NK has publicly stated its desire to reach a peach settlement with the US, however NK did note that, ""If the United States insists on taking a different path, the Korean peninsula will only see our unlimited nuclear deterrent being strengthened further."" This I believe gives credence to @sanxiyn's high forecast, but China's recent disapproval of NK's missile testing over the years makes me think NK may lower their aggressive stance and re-frame from testing any missile (w/ the stated capability) over the next year."

Despite speculation by the international media, there are no signs at the launch pad or the Sohae facility of preparations to launch an SLV. Moreover, in a September 22 CNN interview (updated on September 23), North Korean space scientists stated that it is “very wrong” to “think that we are about to launch a satellite on a particular festival day, on a particular anniversary or on a major holiday” given the difficult scientific challenges of space exploration."""

Reason - There are many; showing offensive and deterrent capability as well as system testing. Restraints - Their long time protector China and new best friend Russia would strongly frown on such activity.
