31275,2020-05-14T15:34:23Z,9,[20.0],[10.0],After re-reading the testimony here is what I think will happen. The Court will not find it unconstitutional if an elector is sworn to an oath in a Court and then does not follow through then they can be punished for perjury. They will find a state can set conditions right up to the time if the vote and remove anyone who says they are not going to vote the way expected. If they are allowed to vote their vote will count no matter how they voted. What if they voted against state’s wishes. There is nothing saying the states can’t punish for that but the term elector as opposed to delegate means ‘their discretion’. Tough one but a ruling that is narrow to this case might happen. It will say not done right in these cases but not unconstitutional if set-up right by the ‘legal’ oath.

You could say originally the State Legislature chose the elector and then the Elector met with other Electors and chose the President. Happened in first two elections but thereafter it has been the Electors are nameless bodies following their state’s dictates. The 12th Amendment states the States have the power to chose their Electors. After thinking about this it could well be that they can set expectations for Electors after they are chosen and punish if those are not met. Court could take middle way and say Constitution says nothing about what an elector is beyond their role as voter but does give a State the power to chose them. It can have criteria for the chose. So status quo? Elector can vote anyway and State can fine. It is up to the State to chose people to agree to do their bidding. The Court seems to be originalist but overturn 200 years of process? I have gone back and forth on this but this is my final answer.

The Tenth Circuit concluded that Colorado lacks the authority to require electors to vote for the candidate receiving the most votes because “the definitions of elector, vote, and ballot [contained in Article II and the Twelfth Amendment] have a common theme: they all imply the right to make a choice or voice an individual opinion.”"

Washington has ruled to uphold the fine, Colorado has ruled on the side of the elector, putting the split at 50/50 and as of January 22, the Supreme Court has announced they will hear the cases. There has been precedence set, in the 1952 case Ray vs Blair, the Supreme Court held that “presidential electors exercise a federal function in balloting for President and Vice-President but they are not federal officers or agents” suggesting that states may retain more control over an elector than they do over a sitting member of Congress or a president. Electors, according to Ray, “act by authority of the state that in turn receives its authority from the Federal Constitution.” Based on the current split, and the previous ruling, I cast my 25% probability vote."

Maybe the point of the fine is to control the elector or maybe the fine is to limit the pool of candidates for elector to only those who will not vote in bad faith. The petitioner are saying the purpose of the fine is to control the elector after being appointed (probaly intrudes on federal roles). Washington is saying its a fine for making a false pledge (definetly a State role). A $1000 fine is not going to control an elector decision. A $100,000 fine probably would control the elector decision. I think the court fudges and says the State can fine but the fine can not be so large as to prevent the elector from executing their independent judgement to select an elector. Why not just say the State is not allowed to levy any fine? Because the State has the right to establish the conditions for the appointment of electors and if an elector intentionally violates those conditions then there should be a penalty for bad faith. As I said its a fudge. They fudge to keep the ruling narrow, no large sweeping opinions. Just recognize what everyone agrees on. Electors make a choice, States appoint electors, and the current system has fines. The decision can be written not to upset Blair. What the decision accomplishes is a flag to electors that they can vote their conscience, and more will do just that, and we have more court cases in the future. Heck, this could even become a whole new right/left split for the voting population, like Whigs vs Federalists."
