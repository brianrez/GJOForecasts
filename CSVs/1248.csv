Over time, the purchasing power of gold has stayed relatively constant, with fluctuations when the economy or monetary supply is less stable, such as during the 2008 recession when gold value increased. In the next two weeks, it's unlikely that the economy will fluctuate to the extent necessary for it to leave the 1,200-1,250 range. Today, (Dec. 4th) the value of an ounce of gold is 1,236 and has been increasing for the past week. It has been in the 1,200-1,250 range for the past month, with the exception of a few days in November when it dipped slightly below 1,200.

The current spot price (Nov. 29; 12:30am) is $1,224.30 (https://www.kitco.com/gold-price-today-usa/). Trends provided by USA Gold (http://www.usagold.com/reference/prices/goldhistory.php) indicate that the spot price for gold has stayed between 1,200.19 and 1,233.16 during the month of November. Essentially, the spot price for an ounce of gold has not exceeded the parameters of more than $1,200 and $1,250. Moreover, if we look at the spot rate over the past year, the spot price has not been outside these parameters since mid July 2018 (https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-price-chart.do). Thus I conclude that on Dec. 28 the spot price of an ounce of gold against the US dollar with be more than $1,200 but less than $1,250."

This analysis is grounded in my assessment of the closing spot price for an ounce of gold against the US dollar for the last five years. First, the spot price for an ounce of gold against the dollar is currently $1,220.75 as of 09:52 on 27 November 2018 (https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/XAUUSD:CUR). Second, the spot price has remained more than $1,200, but less than $1,250 since October 10, an extended period of time. Third, in the last five years, the spot price differential between the end of November and December each year has been less than $30 every year, with the price fluctuating less than $25 in the majority of years. Therefore, it is expected that the spot price for an ounce of gold against the US dollar will stabilize in December. Lastly, the futures price for an ounce of gold for February 2019 is, as of 10:02 on 27 November 2018, is 1,226.80 (https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/gold). Thus, there is high confidence that the spot price for an ounce of gold will stabilize between $1,200 and $1,250."
