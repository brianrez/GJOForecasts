While the demand of cereals continues to rise, in part based on the increasing population, the supply seems to be shaky. The three major exporters of wheat for instance (a component of the price index) are Russia, Canada, and the US. In Russia, production has fallen and reports suggest that Russia may also make it harder for Ukraine to export to continue pressure on Western powers. Canada has had record production which might help however, the US has been undergoing some of its own internal strike-related issues. Historically too prices in October have been higher than in September."

But I'm going to forecast that the cereals index for Oct 22 will be higher than that for Sept 22. Russia's war on Ukraine spiked prices in March 22, and the peak in prices was March-May 22. Since then, the index has fallen. The fall from July to Aug 22 was only 2.1 points, but it was a fall. I expect that the Sept 22 index value might be slightly lower than that for August, but I could also picture it bouncing slightly upward. I think the ""Ukraine bump"" has almost ended (and may have already), especially with increasingly good news coming out of Ukraine, but also as markets adjust to the new realities. Suppose that there is some relatively permanent ""Ukraine effect"" - perhaps a slight increase in the index. I think over the fall and winter, the cereals index will return to the underlying trend, plus whatever ""Ukraine effect"" remains. The underlying trend was up. Where would it be now - around 145-150? Are the pressures that moved the index up before the war on Ukraine still happening? One pressure last fall seemed to be fertilizer prices, although that could be debated, as fertilizer prices affect future crops, etc. Fertilizer prices are higher now than they were at the same time last year; what will they do this winter? There was an energy crisis in China last winter that drove up LNG prices, on which fertilizer prices depend; the LNG situation in Europe is bad, but will there be another energy crisis in China this winter, too? I think it's likely that LNG will generally be up, and with it, fertilizer prices, and with those, cereals prices. So, this question is a tough call, and I don't think October's cereals index value will be very different from September's prices, but I think October is likely to be a little bit higher than September as the index largely resumes its pre-Ukraine-invasion trend and is starts to be affected by seasonal increases in gas and fertilizer prices."
