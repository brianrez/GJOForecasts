So I would give the current king a 50% chance of reaching 84, which he would reach in 2 years. So a very rough assumption is that there is about a 2% chance each month that the current king will die.

Mohammed bin Salam, after his heady rise to power, may be seeing a backlash from the rest of the disenfranchised, robbed and tortured Royal Family. This consolidation of power is not the ""style"" of the Saudis. MBS has been keeping a very low profile recently. Then there was the perplexing arrest of the 11 female activists. It could be perhaps that MBS was never 100% successful in bringing the religious conservatives, the Council of Senior Scholars, heel. It is possible they are asserting their disapproval and moreover may very well be supporting a power-sharing arrangement with a different branch of the Royal Family that will not include the idea of MBS ruling for the next 50 years. Perhaps Salam will be replaced by another son of Abdulaziz in keeping with the traditional lines of succession for Saudi kings. October might be an appropriate amount of time for this to come to fruition. I would suspect that there would be more movement towards the end of Ramadan or shortly thereafter."

His mental status could complicate things, but he could also continue as a figurehead while MbS rules in practice.

No one has explained the reasons for the changes, but the message is clear enough. Soon-to-be-king Mohammad bin Salman wants all to know he’s fully in charge. And maybe he wants to blame the outgoing generals for a badly run war in Yemen for which he might otherwise face criticism. This was done in the King’s name, but it’s the Crown Prince’s agenda. -- ""Signal, GZERO Media"" <signal=eurasiagroup.net@mail205.atl121.mcsv.net>"

Mohammed bin Salman is the declared heir to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and he would be their version of a reform candidate if Saudi Arabia were compared to a democracy. It would be unlikely for a mass uprising against Crown Prince Salman. Former Crown Prince Nayef may have had another thing coming. Youth will be necessary to govern the Saudi Arabia of the future. King Salman is reported to have Alzheimer's which gives the patient an average lifespan of 8-10 years after diagnosis. Regardless of his condition and the level of hands on governing, I believe King Salman will rule until his death. He is 82 now and was very likely diagnosed less than 8 years ago. I believe he will live past October 1, 2018. Crown Prince Salman may take over ruling duties, but abdication is disgraceful and considered weak in that part of the world and his oldest son will protect his father's legacy."

In order to secure the latter's position, he'd want to remain on the throne for at least a few more years, particularly given the infighting within the royal family now and an ongoing proxy war with Iran in Yemen. As such, the current king is unlikely to abdicate unless forced out due to poor health. Men in his family generally live into their 90s, but he is said to be suffering from pre-dementia.

He also holds the positions of First Deputy Prime Minister, President of the Council for Economic and Development Affairs and Minister of Defense. Mohammed bin Salam is less educated than other royal members eligible for Crown Prince and he has really never left Saudi Arabia . He moved very swiftly to take power and can't afford to loose momentum. There is no strategic pause in this political business model and to ensure his political survival he must set his sights on King.

He said that if MBS was going to be king, he'd have done it before he cracked down on the other princes for 'corruption'. His take was the crackdown was a flex of muscles to let the leadership know they've picked the right guy. He also said to take note of MBS pushing forth the Yemeni war, as no other Saud has been a war hawk since old man Saud who founded Saudi Arabia. Between the hawk tendencies and the corruption crackdown, MBS is putting the family on notice that he intends to be a strong king. On the other hand, the current king is known to have some form of dementia (not sure if that is public knowledge) and that leads me to bump up my estimate by 3% as it changes morality tables and the family to find a strong replacement when the time comes. On the other hand, MBS is far younger than any other known king, which is a significant break with tradition. That hints that he's going to be 'seasoned' a while. Overall, if we had a time machine to replay the next 10 months 100 times, I think there'd be a new king 13 out of 100 times."

Maybe the call was actually answered by someone else, but assuming it was the King who spoke to Putin he seems to be alive and able to hold meetings. In the past Saudi Arabia has replaced Kings who were mad or bad, but Salman does not seem to be either, so unless he dies he is probably going to stay King for now. Mohammed bin Salman is very divisive and I am sure many Saudis in positions of power do not want him as the next King, but they are probably very divided about who they do want, so the probability is that he will be the next King, but its far from certain."
