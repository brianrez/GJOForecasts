Anna Palmer and Jake Sherman write that it’s ‘hard to believe’ talks will be wrapped up by the end of July as both sides come to grips with the enormity of the task before them. A difference of priorities exists not just between Republicans and Democrats but between GOP senators and the White House. Leading Republicans including John Cornyn (Texas), Chuck Grassley (South Carolina), and John Thune (South Dakota) have dismissed many of the President’s policy preferences for the new coronavirus aid package as little more than a joke. Part of the divide stems from the fact that senators on both sides are increasingly concerned with solving America’s testing problem before tackling the issue of additional relief. Sen. Lamar Alexander summarized their position: ”My view is, we should do whatever we need to do to make sure we have adequate tests. All roads to open school, opening, going back to work, child care go, lead through testing.”"
