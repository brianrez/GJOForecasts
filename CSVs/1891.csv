While the largely white, blue-collar to middle class white-collar retirement flood of the 1960s, 70s and 80s is aging out of the electorate, it is still a potent conservative force. These voters remember the ""great times"" to which Mr. Trump refers-- the years when someone working on a Chevy line in Ohio could make enough to afford a nice little retirement condo near the Intracoastal. The Cuban community in and around Miami has been reliably Republican for decades. With Sen. Rubio hearing the clarion call of the people, and reneging on his no-second-term stance, they will be out in force to defend that seat. The top of the ticket will benefit, if grudgingly. The area around Orlando has a younger population, which could be expected to skew Democratic. And there are several very large universities in the state. But planning is required! Voters must register 29 days before the election. In addition, voter ID requirements-- photo ID and signature-- can be expected to depress turnout in some Democratic-leaning precincts. The documentation needed to get either a drivers' license or a state ID card would challenge someone who couldn't afford a passport, college ID, etc. If you don't already have one of those, a certified copy of your birth certificate is required as a first step. That, too, costs money. (It is interesting how much of one's identity is actually the property of the state....) This is before any consideration of the impact of differential contact with the criminal justice system. Convicted felons, who have successfully fulfilled the conditions of their probation, may be eligible to [re-]register to vote, then encountering those documentation requirements again. Sec. Clinton has a tough row to hoe if she's to carry The Sunshine State."
