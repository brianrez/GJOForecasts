It's been obvious this question was going to be in the top two options since August 1st. All you have to do is download the data from the resolution site. Filter it by today's or previous days date and do a simple linear calculation: Current total + (yesterday's cases * remaining days). Remaining days is 104 today. You do that, below is the result for countries with a calculation above 500,000. While it doesn't account for the effects of places that will go into lockdown, such as Israel or the U.K., it also doesn't account for seasonality or increased testing capacity. And yet, the crowd is just 29% in the top two options. And, this doesn't even require getting your mind around exponential growth. This is a linear calculation."

Over 400k = 2: Iran and Chile Then there are a group of EU countries all getting spikes of high number of new cases at the moment. For example, France has 373k cases so far. To get to 1m they would need 5k cases per day every day until the new year. Current average is closing in on 10k per day, which reduces the future average needed. So while low probability, it is not out of the realms of possibility for France to hit 1m cases by end of the year."

This question is therefore about how many ""more"" countries will pass the threshold. I argue that there will be at least 1 more and maybe as many as 3 more that cross the 1M threshold by year end. As we have seen holidays or state events are enough to trigger superspreader events that can last a long time. Some have argued that more testing will expose more cases."

That I can´t see it in the curves of the states I analyzed doesn´t mean that the US will stay the only state with a second wave of infections much larger than the first on a superhigh level. Or that Brazil will be the only country with horrendously high numbers at the same level for several months. Lesson learned: if there are examples for it, it can happen again. The probability might be small, but it is not zero. And yes, if testing becomes so cheap and easy, that every new infection is found, numbers might increase even further."

I've put some more thought into how to evaluate the combined probabilities I assign to the top 50 most populous countries and for this purpose I have made a model using Guesstimate [1] — the results of which is a mean of 7.5 (95% CI: 5.6, 9.4) countries exceeding 1M cases by the end of the year. However, I think this 95% CI is much too confident so instead of assuming a standard deviation of 1 I've used a normal distribution calculator [2] to assume a standard deviation of 2.5 so that ~55% instead of 95% of the probability distribution falls in the 5.6-9.4 range, which sounds much more plausible given the large amount of uncertainty we have. The values I've assigned to each bin assumes a normal distribution using these values. Also note that I've also changed some of the probabilities I've assigned to individual countries based on some more reading I've done about their current situations. And finally, big thanks to @jainsa for his commentary — I always welcome critical analysis that has the potential to help me make better forecasts!"

The later should increase over time when test are being sent or produced at ""frontline"" countries. There are 14 countries besides the USA and Brazil that already have more than 200k cases confirmed. With an average of 5-7k cases per day, they would have around 900-1260k new cases by the end of 2020. Countries that don't have spread under control from the above group I have divided into three categories, based on the current and weekly new cases counts. 1. Certain (close to reaching 1m mark in month/two): Russia - 719k; India - 820k 2. Very possible (they have more than 5k new cases daily on top of 200k so far): Mexico - 289k (7k); South Africa 250k (12.3k) 3. Possible (they have less than 5k new cases daily but still a significant number of active cases - testing gap?): Peru - 319k (3.5k); Chile 309k (3k); Iran 252k (2.6k); Turkey 210 (1k); Pakistan - 246k (2.5-4k); Saudi Arabia 226k (3.1k) 4. Observation list (new cases partner are either with test flaws or are high but with a lower number of active cases): Bangladesh 178k (2.8k); Colombia - 133k (4-5k); Argentina 95k (3.1k); Indonesia 72k (2.7k); Bolivia 45k (1.5k) There is also a group of countries that probably will have lot of cases, but don't do testing so we won't see that data: Ecuador, Bolivia, Nigeria, Kenia, Ghana, Iraq or other African, Middle East countries."
