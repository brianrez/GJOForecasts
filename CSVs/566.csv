He is the most likely to resign this year to avoid an election year (grant it mid-term elections) RBG situation and ensure that a liberal is appointed in his place. The major question is, how is his health? I cannot find anything regarding his health. Reviewing his caseload, it appears to be pretty steady and he has hired a full slate of law clerks for the next term, which suggests that he plans to be around for the remainder of the year. However, there is significant pressure from Democrats and progressives for Breyer to step down out of fear of loosing the Senate in the mid-terms, which history supports is very possible. At this time, I have no reason to believe that Breyer will step down this year. The next oldest justices are Thomas (72) and Alito (71). I do not see either one of them going anywhere anytime soon, especially under a Democratic Administration, with the exception of suddenly passing away. The rumors of Justice Sotomayor having some underlining health condition that might result in her stepping down has never been supported by any evidence and appears to have just been a Trump Administration rumor. For now, I am maintaining my forecast, but will be following Breyer involvement in court activities over the next month, mainly how many opinions he pens."

I doubt it's Biden's way of locking away someone Breyer doesn't like so he could retire knowing his replacement would be more aligned with him, considering Jackson clerked for him. Breyer is pretty clear about staying out of politics, saying ""the more the political fray is hot and intense, the more we stay out of it."" Retiring with such a clear (or perceivable) political motive would be out of character, but maybe a situation like this is when you break that character, I don't know.

I see no reason that he would retire from the court prior to the end of the year. -Sotomayor (Obama), Kagan (Obama), Gorsuch (Trump), Kavanaugh (Trump), Coney Barrett (Trump), and Roberts (Bush) are all considered young by SCOTUS standards. -Alito (Bush), Thomas (Bush the elder), both traditionalists have no incentive to leave the court during the Biden administration. -Finally, adding justices to the court...what is being called ""court packing"" in the media, will not happen this year. Although the majority of democrats would love to balance the Supreme Court, in the end it will be a political decision (not to mention that it would set a bad precedent... one co-equal branch of government altering another with very shaky Constitutional authority?).

The average justice since 1900 serves an average of 26 years on the bench. The average of justices who choose to retire is about 74 years old. Five of the last eight President's had a vacancy in their first year in office. This includes the last two Democratic Presidents who were boosted by a retirement during their first year (1993 and 2009). The overall rate of a vaccancy is one about ever 2.06 years. Based on this, there are two Justices who are likely on retirement watch, Justice Thomas and Justice Breyer. Justice Thomas is extremely unlikely to retire. An opening of his seat would likely be due to health issues although that does not appear to be an immediate concern. Justice Breyer however will be under extreme pressure to retire during the next two years. Although the Senate map is favorable in 2022, Liberal democrats will likely not want to take the risk and will apply pressure on Breyer during the next 12 months. Will he be receptive? I think he will be more than perhaps a year ago given the RGB seat and the general politics of the day. It could be interesting to wathc his votes and opinions during the Spring term for any hints of his thinking."

The only real candidate for health problems or retirement would be Stephen Breyer. As the oldest member of the court at age 82, health could become a factor. The most likely scenario, however, would be his retirement resulting from political pressure on the left. There is a desire for him to retire while Democrats control both the White House and Senate to ensure his seat remains liberal for decades to come. If this is to happen, it is highly likely it would be in 2021 to avoid campaign issues in 2022. However, Breyer has not given any indication that his retirement is imminent. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-court/u-s-supreme-courts-breyer-in-retirement-spotlight-after-democratic-wins-idUSKBN29C2S5"

Would he consider vacating his seat to ensure President Biden can nominate before the mid-terms? My guess is not this year, unless he were to become ill. I cannot see any of the Republican appointees vacating, and Justices Kagan and Sotomayor are still relatively young. The obvious outlier is whether President Biden's commission recommends increasing the number of justices. Whilst court packing is popular some circles, it seems slightly counterproductive - the 'other side' can simply do the same and the court quickly gets too big. To get the 'balance' desired 4 new justices would be required (leading to 13 - perhaps someone superstitious might not like that!). For now I am suggesting this is unlikely. However, as the commission gets going, I am sure more information will leak and we can reassess."
