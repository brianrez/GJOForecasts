After reading the oral arguments and doing some brief searching of past cases referenced, it sounds like current precedents typically limit per se physical taking to be a permanent occupation or any occupation that eliminates all economically beneficial uses. The plaintiffs want the court to expand the per se definition to apply to even short-term temporary occupations that didn't exist under common law (so government inspections for the purpose of health and safety would be exempt, since those existed in the early history of America), which I think would mean that any occupation via government regulation would require compensation (unless the form of occupation existed under common law). Alternatively, the California government argues that that would be too expansive and basically that it limits the ability to decide cases on an ad hoc basis, or a more case-by-case basis. In the government's position there are many scenarios where government has an interest in providing temporary access to property which should not be considered a taking when evaluating on a case-by-case basis."

I can't be confident either way, but I would guess the conservative court would go along the lines argued by the dissent in the district court. Basically that unions can be granted access to private property when they can prove that there is little to no way to reach employees otherwise. Which I would guess would lead them to rule that the California regulation is unconstitutional since it doesn't require enough proof that access to the property is necessary. That said it's very possible this question doesn't get resolved, I imagine the court could decide on more narrow grounds. Perhaps they could rule that the specific actions taken by the union in this case were against the California law or that the the case should not have been dismissed and that it could be heard at the lower court. Overall though it seems a little more likely that the court granted cert to strike down the law as unconstitutional."

Generally, a permanent physical occupation is required. The Court would have to determine that the regulation constitutes an easement, which is permanent. That would create a slippery slope with a lot of other regulations that permit inspections, etc. I think this could come down to whether the court determines that the plaintiff actually suffered an uncompensated harm. It's not clear that the plaintiff suffered a harm or loss of use of property. Where I think I could be wrong is that (a) there is a split in jurisdictions over this issue, (b) this is a 9th Circuit decision (and the 9th Circuit is known as particularly liberal), whereas the Supreme Court is a solid 6/3 conservative court. However, I think the liberals and perhaps Roberts and Gorsuch will not agree this is a per se taking, because doing so could invalidate a broad swath of other regulations that permit inspections, etc."
