"Between 1 October 2018 and 30 September 2019, will an armed group from the Democratic Republic of Congo engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in the Democratic Republic of Congo?",2018-09-28T23:00:46Z,2019-01-01T07:59:46Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],83,654,36,237,"The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (Early Warning Project). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 31 December 2018 and will be resolved in October 2019 after EWP assesses the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from October 2018 to September 2019. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilian fatalities occur in one or more campaigns. See (Early Warning Project) for examples. See (GJOpen) for GJO's FAQ on forecasting questions like this.",https://www.gjopen.com/questions/1015-between-1-october-2018-and-30-september-2019-will-an-armed-group-from-the-democratic-republic-of-congo-engage-in-a-campaign-that-systematically-kills-1-000-or-more-civilians-in-the-democratic-republic-of-congo

The question pivots on whether one group will be motivated to target another. Given that the existing political and social conditions are ripe for conflict, large-scale violence can break-out suddenly and for seemingly minor reasons. If the outcome of elections is disputed, or leaves one or more party aggrieved, the approaching election could be one of these reasons, especially if there is perception of fraud."

63213,2018-12-07T20:05:46Z,2,[85.0],[0.0],"There are 70 to 80 armed groups in the DRC more than 4 million people are displaced fleeing violence. The irrational and fanatic ethnic hatred between Hutu and Tutsi has spilled over into DRC from Rwanda. The most likely culprit in a mass slaughter would be the M23, Tutsis with some financial backing from the Rwandan govt. who are now essentially separatists. Despite the presence of U.N. peacekeepers (roughly 15,000)...The FDA (Force Democratique Aliees an Ugandan militia who claim that they want an African 'Islamic State' have engaged in mass killings in an efficient militaristic fashion. They killed several U.N. peacekeepers last month. Weak leadership; old ethnic rivalries, a history of violence, opportunistic warlords and terrorist leaders flowing into the Congo. A bad recipe."

12789,2018-11-30T15:44:46Z,1,[32.0],[32.0],The significant surge in violence within the Democratic Republic of Congo means that loose-triggered militias and even government troops are somewhat likely to carry out killings on such a scale. The recent violence against relatively mild political opposition is an indication that this is more likely than some may think. Any group that becomes identified with political opposition in DRC would be particularly susceptible to mass killings.
