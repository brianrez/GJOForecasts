Through the anti-corruption campaign, Xi Jinping has placed himself in a position that allows for all kinds of future political scenarios that would be impossible under Jiang Zemin, whose power stemmed from corruption and kleptocracy. Already, Chinese scholars have suggested the possibility of China’s taking on a presidential system of governance. In November, the Xi leadership rolled out a pilot program for a new state anti-corruption body that answers to the Chinese legislature, and not the executive branch. Having this body answerable to the legislature may anticipate a change in the structure of the Chinese regime, with the Party no longer being in charge of everything. If Xi takes the anti-corruption campaign to its logical conclusion, the inadvertent outcome might be a post-communist China."""

Xi launched the anti-corruption campaign shortly after taking office, and vowed to crack down on both low and high-ranking officials who abuse their positions for personal gain. Xi also appears to be using the campaign, which is very popular with the Chinese people, to eliminate the faction of Jiang Zemin, the Party elder responsible for fostering pervasive corruption in China. Wang was placed as head of the anti-corruption agency in 2012, and has overseen the arrest of more than a million officials—more than 150 of whom were high-ranking Party cadres in the government, state-run enterprises, and the military. Officials are said to prefer meeting “the Devil” rather than Wang, a gaunt-looking man with a steely gaze. Under Wang’s watch, officials who were considered “untouchable,” like the former Politburo member Bo Xilai and the powerful security czar Zhou Yongkang, were probed and handed over for prosecution."""

WSJ (opinion), July 5, 'The Xi Jinping Ascendancy - A winner-takes-all political struggle continues in China.': http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-xi-jinping-ascendancy-1467748121 Clips from article: 'While the “tiger hunt” for top-level cadres may be over, that doesn’t mean Mr. Xi has consolidated power. China’s political struggle continues in other guises. This will make government policies unpredictable and risks conflict spilling out into public view in ways not seen since 1989. The culmination of these maneuvers could be the removal of Premier Li Keqiang, the one Hu ally on the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, the pinnacle of Chinese politics. Mr. Li would normally serve a 10-year term through 2022, but rumors are flying that Mr. Xi will force him to retire at the Party Congress next year and move other Hu allies into ceremonial positions. Attacking rival factions’ right to exist violates a key tenet of Chinese elite politics since Deng Xiaoping’s rise to power in 1979. The top leader has always governed in consensus with other leaders who maintained their own power bases. These factions competed for key positions but did not seek to eliminate each other. This tradition was designed to prevent a repeat of Mao’s purges. Mr. Xi has upended this decision making by consensus and made himself the decider in all policy realms.' Comments: Li Keqiang. Another name surfaces. Says, he may be eased out next year among others, but..... hey Raising by 10 basis points."

Before Xi took power, Jiang allowed his loyalists in the Politburo Standing Committee—military vice chairs Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong, and security czar Zhou Yongkang, to name a few—to have the final say on their respective portfolios. In turn, Jiang’s loyalists are committed to protecting their patron because it allows for the continuation of the political order that he oversees. Xi seeks real control over the Party, and the only way to do that is by dislodging the Jiang power nexus. He has already purged many of Jiang’s top allies, and assumed control over the Party’s gun through a sweeping military reform. The other key Party organ, the Propaganda Department, seems to be next."" Overseas Chinese-language media have recently carried rumors that Liu Yunshan could be purged, and his Propaganda Department reconstituted."""

783,2016-06-04T04:59:58Z,2,[90.0],[15.0],"The corruption investigation, and the corruption in China was well known prior to the investigation, and generally ignored, includes jail or execution and has several reasons for the rise in the investigations. Here are two of them. Xi wants to stabilize the economy by standardizing the amount of production of materials and commodities. There has been an over production of material that has led to over construction and unsold cheaper goods that has pressured an all ready weakening economy. Over production has led to graft. Some data has been skewed and over valued. Employee tells manager that production was A and manager tells director that production was B and director tells regional director that production was C and so forth. All are given kickback with the least amount going to the employee and the government publishes the skewed data for investors. This is why Xi has arrested people on all levels. But also, if a person was an associate of someone who was arrested, particularly a business associate to someone who was an arrested government official, the business associate was probably arrested, unless he or she gave evidence of others who may have been corrupt, and given another sentence or excused. But the arrests also gives more power to Xi by removing his enemies or opposition, As the economy slides, the Chinese leadership needs a pharmowitnessed kos, and more are being arrested and it will continue into the politburo once his or her supporters are arrested or too afraid to support the arrested official. We this with Mao and that was not long ago. In some ways, he is forced to fight the corruption, but it works politically for him in image and ruling."

Even if it's the former there' s not a huge number of precedents to suggest that a resignation is likely. I think there's been three resignations in eleven years. The Panama papers have linked a few more members to the possibility of family links to corrupt conduct. Paradoxically though, the possibility of several members (including three members of the seven member standing committee) being involved may save them individually, as forced resignations seem in the past to have resulted from consensus decisions by other members.There remains the possibility of further Panama revelations but even so I see a resignation as unlikely."
