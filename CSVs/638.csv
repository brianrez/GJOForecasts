May numbers have been growing for years, BUT from 2019 to 2020 they went down (less overall energy consumption due to Covid-19). The most recent month we have data about, January 2021, was very close to pre-pandemic January 2020. In 2020 that base was not enough to go above the previous yearÂ´s May number. And May 2019 still is the record-holder, only May and June 2020 came close. Overall energy use will be higher this year than in 2020, but will it be so much higher than 2019? And will the renewables be more (and of those: Biomass as the biggest single factor)? Most probably yes, but not 98%. They asked this question with a reason, and it was NOT to give everybody a safe 0.0 Brier for it.

However, I now realize I should remove 2019 from the equation as that was influenced by COVID. That leaves only 2015 and in that case 2013 May consumption was more than 13% above the 2013 average monthly consumption, while 2015 was only 3% above the 2013 monthly average. This means that since 2019 May consumption was 12% above the 2019 monthly average, we would need to see the 2021 May consumption again only 3-4% above the 2021 monthly average, something that might only happen 2 out of 100 years or so.

We have seen pretty steady increases in the May consumption number from 2015-2019 (rising from 0.289 Quadtrillion BTU to 1.052 Quadtrillion BTU). The increase in consumption has also been met by an increase in capacity, which should indicate the energy market is able to meet the pace of growth. 32 GW of new utility-scale solar and wind came online in 2020, which accounted for about 75% of the growth in new electricity capacity. A bulk of the capacity was due to come online in December, which should help the 2021 numbers rebound a bit. Obviouly, the elephant in the room is demand heading into the first half of 2021. If COVID restritions continue it is likely that we continue to see decreases in commercial and industrical demand and increases in residential demand. This is what helped spur the dropoff in May 2020 number compared to May 2019. Given we will need time for a vaccine rollout before we see increase commerial and industrial demand, I am tampering down my expections for the May 2021 numbers until we see more data in early 2021."
