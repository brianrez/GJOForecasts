There would most likely be U.S. Military strikes against Iranian backed militias in Iraq and Syria. President Biden authorized attacks on Iranian back militias in Syria on February 26 to prevent further attacks on US troops operating in Iraq and Syria. President Biden said during his campaign that he wants to reenter the 2015 Iran Nuclear Agreement that President Trump withdrew from. It would be difficult to continue nuclear talks with Iran if the threat of war was on the horizon. After President Trump ordered General Qasem Soleimani’s assassination, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard sent a retaliatory rocket attack against Al-Asad Air Base and base outside Irbil holding American troops in Iraq. Iran warned Iraq the attack was coming to prevent Iraqi deaths claiming they were only targeting the Americans in retaliation but also warned American allies their bases could be targeted as well. Afterwards Iranian authorities gave mixed messages: Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei and Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani both claimed Iran’s “final answer would be to kick all US forces out of the region”. Iran’s Defense Minister Amir Hatami said, “Iran’s response to any US retaliation would be proportional to US actions.” Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif claimed “the attack was in self defense and denied seeking to escalate the situation into war.” If the US wants any agreement with Iran it will not initiate any direct military response unless it is to deter direct attacks against the United States. Initiating direct military attacks against Iran would also worsen American relationships with China and Russia since they are both Iranian allies. If Iran took unprovoked military actions against the United States it would lose its stance on the world stage that it wants to reengage with diplomacy. It could also lead to Iran’s isolation on the world stage, could see more economic sanctions, and could see other American allies, join in military retaliation. After Iran’s retaliatory attacks, UK’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned Iran not to repeat any reckless or dangerous attacks, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would strike back hard against any attacks."

Tensions between the US and Iran definitely rose during Trump's time in office, stemming from actions such as withdrawing the US from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018 and the assassination of Qasem Soleimani in 2020. With the new administration, many are hoping for a shift in dynamic between the two countries; however, with the Biden administration joining European partners in an effort to begin talks with Iran for the first time in several years to settle differences and revive the 2015 nuclear deal, as well as the recent attacks on US bases in the Middle East and Biden's decision to strike Iranian-linked groups in Syria in late February, it is uncertain whether relations between the US and Iran will worsen or better in the following months. But the US and Iran are in a very precarious situation right now, with both sides avoiding a direct military confrontation, instead attacking each other through the US imposing economic sanctions, Iran targeting US allies (such as Saudi Arabia and Israel), and both engaging in conflict through Iranian-backed proxy forces (like Ketaib Hezbollah). These conflicts have mostly occurred in other countries, specifically Iraq, making it even less likely that there will be a confrontation between the two within Iran or at sea. If any lethal confrontation were to occur in the next two weeks, it will be an attack on a US base by Iran-backed militants or a US strike against Iranian proxies, but there is a very low chance that there will be a lethal military confrontation between the national military forces of Iran and the United States military either in Iran or at sea.

Iran has recently refused offers from the European Union to engage the United States directly in talks regarding a rejoining of the Joint Cooperative Plan of Action, levying a requirement for the US to alleviate economic sanctions prior to such a conversation. Some believe Iran is looking for an opportunity to avenge the January 2020 assassination of General Qasem Soleimani, with Iranian judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi going as far as to say their revenge is “close at hand” during a meeting with Faiq Zidan, Head of the Iraqi Supreme Judicial Council in Baghdad. If Iran were to conduct an attack against US forces on land, it would likely continue to leverage a proxy-force such as the Kataib Hezbollah as they have in the past, reducing the chances the US would retaliate with an attack across the Iranian border. Kayhan, a hardline Iranian media outlet, recently cited unnamed “military experts” in crediting Iran with an attack on the MV Helios Ray, an Israeli vehicle carrier, off the coast of Oman, indicating probable Iranian capability and intent to execute such attacks against perceived threats. The US Naval Institute indicated that as of 1 March 2021, the Makin Island Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) is currently located in the Persian Gulf, providing a possible, albeit incredibly well-defended, target for a potential attack such as seen with the MV Helios Ray. Two factors inhibit this option for Iran; first the attack would be highly unlikely to be successful against a large group of US naval ships sure to be on alert in their current geographic location and secondly the political ramifications Iran would suffer if their direct involvement were discovered could see the loss of support from the European Union, causing further economic hardships for the country. Based on this information, I cannot completely rule out the chances of either the US or the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps suffering a fatality at sea over the next two weeks, but it is extremely unlikely. Due to the short suspense for this forecast and the significantly remote chance of this occurring, I will grant a 1% chance this may occur in the next two weeks and a 99% chance that any conflict, if it does occur, will continue through proxy-forces in Iraq and/or Syria."

If either country states that it wants to start negotiations it will lose face, and appear as the weaker of the two powers. With this in mind as with the chicken game, there are four outcomes. Two of them involve either power wanting to negotiate, the other involves both countries agreeing to negotiate and the final one is both countries refuse to negotiate and this would lead to an escalation. Especially with the United States' seizure of Iranian oil(https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/2/15/tehran-calls-us-seizure-of-iranian-oil-an-act-of-piracy), this may lead to an accidental or purposeful lethal confrontation.

Conflict between Iranian proxy forces (primarily Kata’ib Hezbollah) and U.S. military forces in Iraq occurs several times each year. However, retaliatory strikes remain confined to forces stationed inside Iraq. Iran also routinely seizes and sabotages foreign ships transiting the Persian Gulf. However, I found no evidence of Iran targeting U.S. military or civilian vessels. In 2019, Iran did shoot-down a U.S. RQ-4 flying near its border, however, this does not qualify as a “lethal” confrontation as the RQ-4 is unmanned.

I thought this base rate would be too high relative to the average over time, but just researching a little, it seems that US strikes have targeted IR troops in Syria over the past few years, so it might not be that much higher than the post-9/11 average. The base rate also should be moderated by the many factors the crowd has pointed out already, some of which nudge the probability upward and some downward: increased US presence in Gulf at present (up); Iranian exercises in Gulf upcoming (up); legislative determination to ramp up nuclear production (up); a new administration (down); promise for a reentry/renegotiation of the JCPOA (down); economic problems internally (down); COVID preoccupation (down).

Initial Assessment: Outgoing Trump Admin has a history of targeting Iranian officials, with the killing of Soleimani in 2020. It may seek to weaken the position of the Biden admin with Iran by burdening it with an Iran crisis at its very inception. Iran has taken some actions at the beginning of 2021 that seem potentially provocative (https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/08/middleeast/iran-underground-base-gulf-intl/index.html, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-tanker/iran-tells-south-korea-not-to-politicise-seized-vessel-demands-release-of-funds-idUSKBN29F0LF, https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/iran-plans-20-uranium-enrichment-underground-fordo-nuclear-facility-soon-n1252657 ). These increase the probability that the Trump admin will make an excuse to strike Iran. Once Biden is inaugurated, it is extremely likely he will follow Obama’s peaceful example in dealing with Iran. As for Iran striking US forces and inducing US casualties, this has only occurred once even during Trump’s term, as they mainly use terrorists and proxy forces."

Additionally, Iran will likely welcome any overtures made by the U.S. that reduce some of the economic sanctions Iran faces from the U.S. Whether or not this remains the case beyond March 2021 is anyone's guess, but in the near-term, both parties seem to desire a reduction in tension. Furthermore, both countries are facing domestic issues that would only be exacerbated by the threat or engagement of military hostiliites."
97560,2021-01-08T19:11:07Z,1,[3.0],[3.0],"While there is daily contact between Iranian naval forces and the US Navy throughout the Arabian Gulf region, I cannot recall a time in the last 5-10 years that those confrontations have resulted in the death of a servicemember from either nation. Such an occurrence would probably result in a significant escalation in the region, so it is not in either nation's interest to have such an event occur. Both nations seem to favor proxy warfare or engaging one another in a ""perceived"" neutral location, e.g. Iraq or Yemen. As someone who has spent months onboard a US Navy ship in the region, the near-daily contact between the forces and the tensions that exist means that the probability cannot be reduced too low."
96722,2021-01-08T17:44:29Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],"As the anniversary of the Soleimani strike has come and gone with little movement on Iran's part it is hard to believe that there will be an intentional violent confrontation. Instead, despite US domestic issues, Iran seems to be pursuing a more legalistic approach to the the US by issuing arrest warrants, as well as likely inciting Iraq to the do the same. This approach is more beneficial to the Iranian regime as it likely expects the incoming Biden administration to move back towards the JCPOA. If Iran inflames tensions and it results in death(s), a return to the deal will become more unlikely. With the tensions in the region lethal confrontations remain possible, but both sides have shown a willingness to avoid death even when discord climaxes."

This not least relating to a return to the JCPOA or something similar. Iran will of course talk tough, but even statements from The Supreme Leader point further towards a pause to see what Biden will do (see AP link in question details)."

However, intentional conflict between the two countries is extremely unlikely because the Trump administration is distracted with domestic issues and the Iranian government will want to start its relationship with the incoming Biden administration off on the right foot."

Should Iran continue with terrorist attacks against US military personnel in Iraq then there is distinct possibility of at least one fatality. The incoming Biden administration should offer a more appeasing approach to US Iran relations and diplomacy over using the threat of the US military might should prevent escalation of military confrontation. Good trade relations should help and the need for Iran's need for help from the US for their domestic COVID pandemic problem will also calm relations.

To engage in a confrontation with the US is probably unlikely. Also, Iran has been suffering under the Trump led sanctions after the US left the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) by an International consortium. Given that Biden’s administration is similar to that of Obama the new president may want to re-engage with the JCPOA, with Iran hoping for a reduction in sanctions by reducing nuclear activities. Iran does not need to embarrass Trump given the current situation in Washington giving Biden time to calm things down. It does not seem to be in either party’s interest to engage in military confrontation."
