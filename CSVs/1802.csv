I believe that the election of Donald Trump will allay the row between the Philippines and the U.S. Trump has thus far narrowed American foreign relations to issues of trade and security. As a result, Duterte and his ego will feel safer against criticism from a powerful corner, and will be more willing to tone down his rhetoric and work with the United States. His recent appeal to Muslim separatist rebels against Islamic State also indicates a deficit in his ability to counter terrorist forces that the U.S. could bolster--a mission that aligns heavily with current U.S. foreign policy goals."

Philippines won the courtcase against China about the Chinese sea, but China ignores any decisions by 'The Hague'. Eventual need form the USA doesn't mind when it is about characters. If Duterne put up a finger to the UN why not to the USA? So why should the USA have this joined exercise. USA has to concentrate on Middle East, and North Korea. For the latter working together with Japan is more obvious. Both leaders are very poor listeners to their advisers (to put it mildly). On the other hand it has to be mentioned that Trump choose quite a number of (former) military staff in his Cabinet. Unlikely would be between 10-33% and very unlikely between 5-10%. Average of both classes would make 14%. Both can change opinion over night and are completely non-reliable on their own statements. So with these two leaders you never know and have to stay very far away from anything certain close like 0% or 100%. Following Sami Virtanen and far away from concensus."

On the one hand is the Feds Rate hike and promise of three more next year and the pressure that puts on the Yuan and on the other the capture of the Navy's underwater glider. Should that UUV actually be returned it will be an indicator of of Chinese willingness to support the status quo. If Duerte sounds off on the Chinese side of the issue it may result in the exercise turning into a Map Ex.

Duterte may want to pivot towards China and Russia and as a gesture of reliability could cancel the military exercise. There is also the nuance that the exercise may well go ahead with a significant reduction in US involvement and number of troops attending, with them playing a more advisory role.
