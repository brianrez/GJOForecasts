According to BBC, he wrote a letter to his son, the current King Felipe VI, expressing his wish for his son to rule in peace. It is clear that the recent investigations between the former king and Saudi Arabia has bothered him. So, the risk of the investigation (he has lost immunity now that he has abdicated) and the possibility of tarnishing his son's reputation by proximity lowers his chance of returning from 50% to 10%. He also has not publicly expressed a desire to return to Spain, which further lowers the chance to 4%. However, he may wish to visit his family, so the probability will be raised to 5% (minor increase due to the ease of communication via technology in today's society)."

Particularly in the light of the fragile Spanish government coalition and the Covid-19 pandemic in the country. Thus, the likelihood of the Spanish warrant of arrest for Carles Puigdemont being rescinded is exceptionally minimum at best. The European arrest warrant was dropped by the Spanish in July 2018. That was the result of the election of Puigdemont to the European Parliament. In January 2020, the Spanish court requested the European Parliament to revoke Puigdemont's parliamentary immunity. This is not likely. Hence, while Puigdemont is a Member of the European Parliament, I forecast zero probability of his return to Spain in this time frame."

The legal opinion is that he has immunity from prosecution while he was King prior to his abdication in 2014 but has no immunity in Switzerland. His son Felipe VI who inherited the crown has disowned and distanced the royal institution Carlos. His actions have raised discussion in Spain concerning the raison d’etre for the Spanish Monarchy which has perhaps made his presence in Spain more of an embarrassment.
