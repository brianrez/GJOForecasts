In exchange, Republicans agreed to extend a series of expired or expiring renewable energy tax breaks. Both the wind production tax credit and the solar investment tax credit won five-year extensions in the tax and spending package unveiled on Tuesday... So the Republicans will let free market set oil prices while endorsing the Business welfare incentives for Green Shoot industries that can't make it on their own and will continue destroying the carbon fuel industry and putting people in the unemployment line. Miners and Driller mine and drill, guess we'll need a tax supported retraining program for them next election. Thats NOT an energy Policy. IMHO Bill McKibben, the co-founder of the climate change group 350.org, called lifting the ban hypocritical in light of the climate agreement leaders reached in Paris this weekend. “Doing it the week after the solemn and pious talk about saving the planet is not like some parent who smoked dope in the ‘70s warning their daughter about drugs — it’s like a parent who is currently high warning their daughter about drugs,” he wrote in an op-ed for The Hill."

The Senate is pushing forward with its own bill, which was passed out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee in July along a strict party-line vote. But that's not the only bill out there. The Senate Banking Committee is taking up a bill introduced by Democrat Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, which could bring more support from the minority party. The committee is expected to vote on the bill Thursday, moving two bills to the Senate floor for consideration. It is not known when the bill will come up for a vote. Senate leadership has been coy on the legislation, as many analysts and observers say it faces an uphill battle there."""

A Hart Research public opinion poll in December of 2014 revealed that a vast majority (82 percent) of voters, regardless of political affiliation, oppose allowing oil and gas companies to export more U.S. oil and gas to foreign nations. This result is bolstered by other polls. Without public or presidential support, there is little chance this will be repealed. Senators struggle to find path for repealing U.S. oil export ban http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/15/usa-oilexports-senate-idUSL1N11L2AU20150915"

While the legislation is likely to pass the GOP-controlled House, its prospects in the Senate are less clear, and the White House said it opposes it. ... Mr. McCarthy is scheduling the vote for the last week of September, but fights over unrelated spending issues could push the vote on oil exports by a week or two, according to GOP House aides. ... A Senate panel voted earlier this summer on similar legislation to lift the oil-export ban, but no Democrats supported the measure. That bodes poorly for its prospects before the full Senate, should it come up for a vote at all in the coming weeks. A spokeswoman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), whose office controls the floor schedule in the Senate, declined to comment.
