My understanding is that the higher energy output can generate much more data within the same period of operation time. Calibration provides for search optimization by indicating certain areas of focus in the parameter space. So maybe the question becomes, how quickly can we shift through the data? The limitation should be computing power, right? Or, is the limitation also a function of the operating energy that allows us to search parameter space that is inaccessible to the previous and possibly the current energy output? Am I understanding this correctly?"

""We tried to find all possible explanations for this,"" he said. ""We wanted to find a mistake - trivial mistakes, more complicated mistakes, or nasty effects - and we didn't. ""When you don't find anything, then you say 'well, now I'm forced to go out and ask the community to scrutinise this'."" Despite the call for caution, the results caused controversy within the world of physics. If the findings had been confirmed, they would have disproved Albert Einstein's 1905 Special Theory of Relativity. Earlier this month, a test run by a different group at the same Italian laboratory recorded neutrinos travelling at precisely light speed. Sandro Centro, co-spokesman for the Icarus collaboration, said that he was not surprised by the result. http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-17560379 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

While some leading researchers are optimistic for the long term potential of this research program and it's central question, most international researchers at CERN indicate the discipline in a ""state of confusion,"" (not from ignorance of central questions of the discipline) but see it as a potential for paradigmatic changes over time. There is no agreement (scientific discovery cannot be 'forced' onto the empirical world, but emply the use of scientific methods to engage with process of discovery of phenomena not currently or previously known) among researchers regarding fundamental discovery of the primitives of the discipline; whether and how, or even if, the existence of sparticles will be empirically validated in their research. The discipline of physics and the field of supersymmetry appears to on the cusp of significant and interesting discoveries that bound to change the fundamental foundations of the discipline. However, only time will tell!"

One consequence of Einstein’s theories is that energy and mass are equivalent. This means energy, like mass, has a gravitational pull. A second consequence is that gravity changes the flow of time. Such gravitational time dilation is a well-established phenomenon. Atomic clocks kept at different altitudes on Earth, for example, get out of sync with one another because they are subjected to different gravitational forces. .......... According to Dr Brukner, the clock thought experiment shows that the metric field is yet another phenomenon which is subject to Heisenberg’s principle, and therefore to superpositional effects. As a consequence, it is no longer only location in space that becomes uncertain, but also location in time. Often, therefore, it would no longer be possible to say which of two events came first. http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21723095-does-one-thing-lead-another-time-may-be-fuzzy-if-so-idea-causality"

The last note from the ATLAS research team (https://atlas.cern/updates/physics-briefing/atlas-releases-new-results-search-weakly-interacting-supersymmetric) is that they did not find a ""significant deviation"" from what they expected.
