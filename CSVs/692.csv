The former was fairly comfortable for their opponents and while the latter was definitely an attention grabber 'til the end it showed that the Falcons just don't have the winning mentality and cold-blooded finishing capability needed to win a division in the NFL. The Bucs are trying to make a go with proven talent and it has had mixed results so far. They are already down 1 game to the Saints and have not been truly convincing in either of their games this season. They, however, sit in second with a record of 1-1 for now and have the largest chance of challenging of taking the top spot away from the favorites. The Saints have proven talent who are accustomed to playing together, a record-breaking quarterback, and a record of winning the division even when the opposition teams were far better than they are now. Injuries are really the only factor here that could change the outcome, but given their depth in most key spots it is unlikely this will be enough to swing the division any other way."
