His other advantage is the lack of a discernible opposition on the ground in Belarus. Tikhanovskaya’s tours of European capitals have little effect, given the EU is somewhat ineffectual when confronting Belarus/Russia and demonstrators are not pro-western but anti-Lukashenko.

So he must either support Lukashenko to stay in power at least till the end of the protests or he must replace him but then it would have to look like not the success of protests. It is impossible for me to imagine all the possibilities but one way for Putin to replace Lukashenko and do not make it look like protesters succeded is to make him ""die from a heart attack"" or something - but this would be quite a radical move and Putin would probably need the support of some current key Lukashenko's backers - I am not sure if they would be ready just yet to turn on him. Replacement of Lukashenko could be benefitial for Putin in longer term if he play his cards well - he could in fact get much more control over Belarus (thru investment of money, activity of his secret services and criminal groups he control) but there is also a risk. I think his is not that comfortable with backing Lukashenko, but he might continue to do so untill the price is to high. In the same time he probably is preparing for other options. For now he could really pressure Lukashenko to try to gain what he wanted for a long time since Lukashenko is now so dependent of his support."

The idea is that the population is not now anti-Russian and he wants to keep it that way. He has not invaded so far but keeps threatening. Putin has extracted concessions from Lukashenko so might continue to back him. Key item that made me change my prediction is that Putin declared the Coordinating Committee for the Opposition illegal and unconstitutional. I could see Putin coming in and forcing Lukashenko to have another election in which a bigger Pro-Russian President is elected. That would take time.

Can they endure tens of thousands every weekend protesting against AL? This is somewhat like Venezuala, but without the steadfast supporters of the incumbent dictator, the Chaveznistas.

Externally, Russia is quite a confounding factor: though Lukashenko refuted Putin’s suggestion of a country merge in the past, Putin has a vested interest in showing force towards both NATO and his own protestors by sending troops into Belarus as a demonstration of support for the regime. However, increased protests within his own country, as well as everything happening in Belarus, may have rattled Putin (if the suspected poisoning of Alexei Navalny is any indication); he seems aware of the counterproductive nature of police brutality as a tool to suppress dissent. Furthermore, given the economic union between Russia and Belarus, any future Belarusian government would likely still be reliant on Russia: thus, Putin may have no particular political incentive to help Lukashenko that much. In the West, both the EU and the US have refused to recognize the legitimacy of Belarus’s recent election, but response beyond that has been feeble: some sanctions were called for in the EU, but nothing more. It appears that this issue will most likely be settled domestically: the one thing that is clear is the fact that Lukashenko needs the loyalty of his own security forces and armies to stay in power. If the protests of the Belarusian people continue in their current scope, he may find himself losing this loyalty; the question is whether he will lose it before November."

Lukashenko says NATO, EU and US are instigating change in Belarus [2]. Lukashenko asked Putin to help. Putin has avoided direct intervention. To me, this says that Putin (who is not the biggest fan of his Belarussian counterpart) knows he cannot plant a coup so has advised Lukashenko to warn of an imaginary foreign interference. This is clever from Putin because it plants the idea into the head of Belarussians that the West is meddling in their affairs / that Moscow is the friendly ""good cop"" / neighbour. If my assumption is correct, it means that Putin wants Lukashenko to stay in power for now. This combined with the fact that Lukashenko says he will ""solve"" the protests with the army, suggests he is going into full survival mode. The increase in protests shows that the public is not fatiguing and will continue for a long-time to come, which warrants a 5% increase. From now, I will likely revise my judgements from either Russian interferences or military news. Hopefully, there will be some form of military factionalism, which tends to be a regular starter of dictatorship coup d'etat's [3] - realistically, the chances of this are low for now.

While this could change, Russia's willingness to distance itself undermines the credibility of Lukashenko on an international stage even further and is more likely to spur external, open support for his removal. 2) The protests are growing, not shrinking. In my initial post, I suggested that it was likely the protests would begin to die down as time passed, but recent reports suggest the exact opposite. This not only shows that the people of Belarus are intent on making a change and willing to fight for it despite reports of the arrests and abuse of protesters, but their prolonged protests are bringing further international attention. 3) Similarly, the news cycle has not yet grown bored of this story which, unfortunately, is surprising but promising for those that want Lukashenko out. More news means more information for everyday citizens, which means more outrage both at home and abroad, which means more pressure on political leaders and dissidents to throw Lukashenko out of office. Whether this happens by November 11th is still up in the air, especially with everything going on and the possibility the story does begin being buried under an ever changing news cycle, but right now is as likely a time as any for a head of state to be thrown from (or flee) their office."

Two hours later there was a mass anti-government rally. Around 200,000 people showed up. And that was just in Minsk. The entire country took to the streets in solidarity.

The key factors here are the Belarusian Military and security forces and Russia. From what I have read for a democratic revolution to succeed military needs at least not to take action against the protesters which is more likely when some of its members are supporting them (and then military leaders fear inner fights within the military). If protests will last and security forces will remain loyal to Lukashenko, he could introduce the martial law claiming that there is foreign threat (he is already using this retoric about the threat from NATO forces in Poland and Lithuania). If at least part of security forces and/or the army would rebel against him he might receive unofficial support from the Russian military (possibly even disguised as Belarusian Army units to avoid anti-Russian sentiments among Belarusians). I think Lukashenko will only ask Putin for help if he won't have other options to stay in power since he don't fully trust him, and would be much more dependent from him if he receives such help.

If the protests become so much that extreme violence is used again to stop it, then there might be an uprising or coup to take over. If Russia is smart, they will have picked someone in power there to take over if they need to assassinate Lukashenko. It would be like a VP taking over for a dead president and suddenly everything changes and is better in a game of gathering support so their party stays in power even if the VP is not elected as the next president.

In that time, he has been able to consolidate almost all governing power under himself, either directly or through surrogates in the legislative and judicial branches of Belarus. Even if these two branches were to turn on him, he still wields more power than either of them, including an ability to simply dissolve the House of Representatives, appoint (and therefore dismiss) nearly all judges, and name eight members to the upper house. So, legislatively, it is virtually impossible to force him to quit the presidency via impeachment or similar means. As for public opinion, polls are heavily regulated, with the most recent ones (2016) leaked to outside news outlets showing an approval lingering around 30%, very low for such a long-serving leader. Moreover, he has blamed these protests on criminals and unemployment, telling people to 'get a job' instead of addressing the electoral fraud questions directly. There also appears to be little to no outside pressure from any foreign power for his resignation, while many foreign authoritarians are voicing their support for him. As such, it is unlikely he will step down due to public or international pressure, as he does not appear to believe the people's support is a priority and has no reason to fear foreign interference. So, that really only leaves a successful assassination attempt. In the last 20 years, there have only been five successful assassinations of heads of state, with the last coming in 2011 with the death of Gaddafi. So a decent anchor rate is 25% per year, or 6.25% per 3 months. As no foreign powers have taken an interest in his removal (so far), this should be lowered. Let's say 4%. Now, the election results were only announced on August 9th, so while large protests are not a good thing for the president, until they become long-term they are unlikely to represent any sustained and organized threat to his seat or his life. It will be interesting to see if these demonstrations continue (or even increase) in the coming weeks, in which case the percentage may begin creeping up to mirror the added intensity and seriousness of sustained and widespread displeasure."

He is a Soviet-era figure who has a Soviet-esque style of managing his country — ""He has supported state ownership of key industries ... retained much of the country's Soviet-era symbolism ... Elections are not free and fair, opponents of the regime are repressed, and the media is not free"" [2]."

93350,2020-08-11T18:58:02Z,1,[85.0],[85.0],"Lukashenko claimed an 80.23% victory over Ms.Tikhanovskaya who apparently received 9.9% of the vote has been disputed. The overwhelming landslide is considered brazen and would have been more believable if a 55% claim had been made and the anger restricted. According to a previous British Ambassador, the country is unified in its condemnation of the election and compares the situation to the 1989 revolutions that destroyed European communist regimes. Pro-Kremlin and state-run media in Russia had shown support for anti-Lukashenko protests or downplayed the demonstrations. Tikhanovskaya has fled the country to Lithuania citing her family’s safety, that appears to have been a threatening situation that would leave a vacant space for an opposition figurehead. Lukashenko is now dependent on the loyalty of his militia (army/Police) in the whole country and his immediate elite to ensure his position as President which will dictate his length of tenure plus Moscow will not want to lose Belarus to Western interests. This will not be determined by an election rerun, but by a toppling of the President and his regime. I propose that given internal and possibly external pressure Lukashenko will not last until November 11th 2020 although the opposition will need a leader to focus on."
