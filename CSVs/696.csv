These are my three primary data points: Hackers attack every 39 seconds, on average 2,244 times a day. (University of Maryland) The average time to identify a breach in 2019 was 206 days. (IBM) The average lifecycle of a breach was 314 days (from the breach to containment). (IBM) Since the time from the presidential election to the close of this question is 184 days, less than both of the averages of 206 and the 314 days, plus the info from @juancambeiro on CISA's election confidence, leads me to my 0 assessment."

This is attributed to Trump administration’s reimposition of sanctions on Iran which have resulted in increased levels of economic and social hardships and an increased threat of a direct military engagement with the U.S. . Tehran views the re-election of President Donald Trump as leading to further instability and greater economic challenges . Conservative Iranian elements also criticized a possible new administration led by former Vice President Joe Biden as one that will not alter attempts to isolate the Islamic Republic . Intelligence sources claim Iranian covert disinformation operations relating to the U.S. electoral process were carried out using automated bot accounts and fake personas on social media (ex. “Endless Mayfly” campaign . Overt Iranian information operations have rapidly established programs such as English language “Palestine Files” which adjoined U.S. topics like Black Lives Matter and the death of George Floyd with that of pro-Palestinian and “anti-Zionist” movements. . Such operations broadly contribute to Iran’s objective of deteriorating the U.S. government reputation . Iranian media groups like Press TV use investigative reporting and interviews with U.S. based persons on topics such as domestic politics and social developments to depict perspectives that support Iran’s interests . Intelligence sources assess these efforts are specifically aimed at English-speaking audiences, primarily in the U.S., with the goal of lowering the audience’s confidence in the democratic process . Cyber operations have also impacted the U.S. election space, showcased by reports of Iranian state-sponsored threat actor APT35 conducting phishing attacks against the campaign staff of President Donald Trump in June 2020.” It goes on with further details but you get the gist... the above information did not come from the U.S. It is possible another state actor influenced it however (dis-disinformation?).

Does it mean the election is swayed from D to R in a particular seat, or that 1 bad vote is tallied and later disqualified? If an election outcome is swung, it necessarily means vote totals were adjusted, or votes were moved from one person to another."

The immediate focus is on the Presidential election on November 3rd, but there are other elections to be held on that date. Depending on the type of election will possibly determine the probability, source and likelihood of a cyberattack. All elections are potentially susceptible to an attack and therefore the result could be affected. Looking at the register of elections to be carried out in California in the remaining part of 2020, there appears to be just November 3rd, that is for the General Election, school boards, DA and Superior Court and possibly other minor appointments. The Federal election appears to have postal vote issues that could be manipulated. Possible, but not likely due to an awareness, trained officials and a paper trail as dictated by Californian law. School Boards could be hacked by tech savvy students. Is this possible? – Yes. The District Attorney and Superior Court appointments could be the focus of criminal elements. Is this possible? Yes. According to the findings of the referenced websites, local officials lack the skills or training to monitor malpractices, potential or otherwise. The attacks themselves could be an attempt to distort results emanating from the system itself, such as voting lists/postal ballots, lobbying influential parties or creating rumours and innuendo via social media. The result of the latter being a creation of a disillusionment and distrust in the system by declining to vote at all, which would affect the result of the vote. If the result of any election held in California had been affected by a cyberattack, would it be discovered? Perhaps not and that is why 3%. https://ballotpedia.org/California_elections,_2020"
