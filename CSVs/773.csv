Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman said authorities are certain that no-one was driving the car at the time of the crash. [...] Federal traffic safety officials are investigating several Tesla crashes in which the vehicle’s Autopilot function may have been used, including crashes in which cars drove under tractor trailers. The company warns customers that its driver-assist system, called Autopilot, is not an autonomous-driving program, and that they must pay attention and be ready to take control of the vehicle.

The most publicized case was when an Uber car killed a pedestrian. The result was the backup driver but not the firm being charged. (https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54175359) There is also a push within the U.S. to hold technology firms in general more accountable and this could expand into the self-driving vehicle sector. The timeframe of this question is significant and with the proliferation of self-driving vehicles it is likely that more criminal charges will be filed.
