However there is still a general risk that Iranian strategic level counters (such as advances in their missile program) to US policies will be demonstrated in this month.

As such the launch of a ballistic missile at this moment is somewhat unlikely. Yet, consider the Trump administrations stance ( as well as the rest of the political conditions in the region, especially Saudi Arabia) might make some in Tehran think that a show of force (such as that which could be created by launching a satellite) could be seen as beneficial for the regime."
