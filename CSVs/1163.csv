The larger single killing per-year in Afghanistan is around 100 civilians, some years larger, some years smaller, but that indicates that the probability of a 1000 civilian killing is (100/1000)^2.5, or about 0.3%, maybe a bit larger if the exponent happens to be smaller. I round it to 1%, which is still a bit too pesimistic."

It says ""If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilian fatalities occur in one or more campaigns."" I am good until it says ""only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilian fatalities occur in ONE OR MORE campaigns."" I noticed there are some other questions which are similar to this one involving other countries, I don't really understand how to answer these. Does terrorist activity from a single group in general count as a campaign? Or do they want to know if something big will happen like a huge multiple bombings of malls across a region or something, like a coordinated attack?"
