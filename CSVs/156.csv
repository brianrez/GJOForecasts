Granted, there is a large stochastic element, and the total number of birds affected depends largely on large farms getting hit, but I would have expected at least 1 or 2 farms with >1M birds to be affected in October by now. But while more *backyard* flocks have been affected in October so far than in September, fewer *commercial* farms have been affected so far. I have no idea whether this reflects enhanced biosecurity among egg and poultry producers, sheer luck, or a combination of both, but the result is <1M birds affected so far in October, when 6.15M were affected in September. So, I am raising my forecast a bit further on bin 2. There is only 2.27M to go to reach 50M, and I still think that's highly likely to be reached, but it might not be. The top 10 poultry-inventory states have almost completely been bypassed lately. It's weird, and I don't understand it."

Also, I think producers are already circling the wagons to prepare for bird flu's return, as a variety of news sources are warning commercial and backyard poultry producers to expect more HPAI this fall. The more bird flu is around, the more producers will step up biosecurity. (Kind of the opposite of the situation with Covid.) Still, a lot is up to chance."

More than 50M birds were lost in the spring 2015 outbreak; there is variability across seasons and years. Nonetheless, because the question ends in early November, I think bin 4 is fairly unlikely.

And it's in Canada. It's in wild waterfowl populations up north for the summer. The USDA said months ago that it's becoming dominant in wild waterfowl populations in North America. I expect that we'll start seeing more of it with the fall migration, which will start in a few weeks. I don't really see a good reason why it would affect substantially fewer birds in fall than in spring; poultry producers were already prepared for it in spring. But maybe producers will be even more careful after last spring. But, viruses do mysterious things, so I also don't rule out the possibility that HPAI mostly goes away and is replaced by some other low path strains; that's bin 2.https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nwhc/science/distribution-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-north-america-20212022"

I expect spring cases to wrap up in the next week or 2. 130k more to reach 40M. There were ~103k birds affected from May 18 through today, and ~183k affected from May 17 through today. I think it's very likely the total by the end of this month and the end of the spring migration will be <40M. But obviously, if it is, it will be very close. Still, I think there's a real possibility that the total will remain under 40M by the end of the month and that there won't be a fall outbreak, so I'm leaving substantial weight on bin 1 for now. I really can't narrow the forecast down between any of the 4 lowest bins at this time. And 50.4M poultry were affected in 2014-15 outbreak, so I suppose I should leave open the possibility of another 50M+ in the fall. I don't understand why the crowd is so low on bin 4 at this time, though; if 40M are affected in the spring migration, it would seem possible that 40M could also be affected in the fall, if HPAI continues to circulate in N American waterfowl."

I think a fall outbreak is somewhat likely because HPAI H5N1 has become dominant in waterfowl in N America, but it's far from guaranteed. So, I think bin 1 is still very much a live option.

The spring migration is wrapping up, Iowa (with the largest chicken inventory in the country) hasn't had a confirmed case since May 4, and no flock with at least 100k birds has been affected since May 3. The total as of today is 37.95M, and it may well stay under 40M by the end of the spring migration. Then we have to worry about fall migration; there may or may not be any cases in the fall. I do think it's more likely than not that we'll see some, as HPAI has become dominant in N American waterfowl, but it's also possible we won't see any substantial numbers. We didn't see much in fall 2015. So, I'm giving bin 1 a big chance. I think any number between 38M and 80M is possible, so I have to assign a fairly low probability to 4 bins, which means I'll probably have a bad score lol."

April 28's total is 35.52M, which is about where I thought we might be for all of April. Another big commercial operation was hit in Nebraska yesterday, affecting 2.1M birds. Also, it looks possible that spread is occurring between farms in Lancaster County, PA, as they are having a lot of outbreaks there on commercial farms in close succession, starting on April 15 and still ongoing. As my forecast was that the total would end up very close to 40M with most inter-farm spread being prevented, I think the big hit in Nebraska plus ongoing spread in Lancaster, PA will very likely tip the balance over 40M. PA is #4 in the country in the number of chickens in 2021, at ~37M, so there's a lot of possibility for damage. And PA wasn't hit hard in the 2015 outbreak, so their poultry farms may not have developed a culture of biosecurity at the level needed to prevent the spread of bird flu. I think we can expect to see more commercial operations affected in Lancaster, PA in the coming days and possibly weeks, and possibly in neighboring counties as well, if the outbreak spills over."

I think the key to this question is understanding how bird flu is transmitted to poultry. The reservoir for this disease is waterfowl, and it's a gastrointestinal disease in waterfowl. It spreads to commercial and backyard flocks and other birds through the droppings of migrating birds; the virus gets into poultry areas directly, by droppings falling into poultry areas, or indirectly, by inadvertently being brought into poultry areas on clothing, shoes or equipment. The goal of USDA policy is to prevent infections caused by wild birds and local spread between farms through good biosecurity practices. Migratory waterfowl that are the primary carriers of this disease largely migrate to Canada, with resident populations also in the northern US, especially around the Great Lakes; if local spread can be eliminated, then once the spring migration season is over, infection risks will recede to close to zero. The threat may then return with the fall migration season."
