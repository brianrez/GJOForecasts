However, given the low likelihood of China engaging in any conflict directly with any country's forces and over Taiwan meaning war with the US (and possibly even Japan), and seeing how Ukraine has gone for Russia, this is the probability I would assign to China engaging in a lethal conflict with any country directly before 28 November 2022."

Don't peacetime exercises (which are underway right - PRC conducting as demonstrations to Taiwan) sadly have lethal outcomes for a few participants.

The CCP National Congress is coming up in October, its unlikely Xi would want to rock the boat much before then. Afterwards, at least as far as deliberate acts, there aren't many great candidates. The goal for Taiwan invasion capability is 2027 (https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2022/06/06/2003779417), the Indian border has been contentious but there haven't been conflicts (as far as we know) like the ones in 2020.

The United States has told China that there may be a chance of direct intervention if they invade Taiwan. If there was direct conflict, a large portion of Taiwan is covered in mountains, and China probably doesn't have a lot of experience fighting in the mountains, therefore Taiwan would have the advantage. Also, it would take YEARS if they were to be victorious and a lot of money to supply China's military. There is 0 percent chance China goes to war with Japan or India. Japan is part of NATO, and China would take whatever measures not to anger the NATO alliance. China and India have disputes all the time, including some brutal disputes in the past few years, but they never actually invaded one another.
