Already Russia is processing many inhabitants through its ""filtration"" system in which people are stripped naked, many tortured, everyone's cell phones searched, and those who aren't imprisoned or executed are deported to low population and distant areas of Russia. This ongoing horror is a huge motivation for Ukraine to expel Russians from this region, and for those who fear filtration to flee to areas held by Ukraine by any means possible. Given the partisan warfare ongoing behind the front lines, there is a good chance many will be enabled to escape across the front liens. These people will not be counted for this question, only the deported victims of filtration."

Concurringly, we have to take into account that refugee figures do not follow the number of internally displaced people (IDP)s in a one-to-one fashion. Importantly, corridors of mobility (including still intact infrastructure) that are fairly proximate to battlegrounds play a primary role, thus pointing towards that refugees being able to flee (flee rate) will start plateauing. This would point towards option C as the most likely scenario. As a part of a broader scenario planning, taking into account the worst battles are yet to come. Things to follow:"

Only 0.4M became refugees in the first 2 weeks of April. But I think ongoing Russian military campaigns in the south will keep causing more to leave, if they can. I agree with the crowd that the lower forecast bins are most likely. 4.6M from Feb 24 to April 13, in 1.5 months. 3 months in this forecast. The only way I could picture a similar overall pace would be if the war took a turn towards chemical weapons or tactical nuclear weapons. Barring such developments, I think it's reasonable to guess that we'll most likely see the numbers climb at rates similar to those now (0.4M/2 weeks), so that we might see ~0.5M-1.0M new refugees per month, for a total of ~6.1M-7.6M by July 28. But a lot can change, so I'm casting a wide net. I think the crowd is about right. For the total to stay under 6.4M, only 1.8M would be added, or an average of 0.6M/month. That's quite possible, if the rate keeps falling."

If we assume this rate until July 15th, we would have a total number of 4.8m + 0.8m*6 = 9.6m... but there is not an ""unlimited supply of refugees""!! First of all we have to guess the initial number of ""potential refugees"", we have to consider Ukraine total population (42m) and substract men between 18 and 65 (around 14m), people that will not leave because of ideology or health reasons (say 10m), etc. Therefore, we would be estimating 18m as initial number of ""potential refugees"", of which 4.8m (26.7 %) already have left. What has happened with the remaining 73.3%? They have had 50 days for leaving but so far they have decided to stay (perhaps my guess of people that stay because of ideology or health is too low). My estimation is that an additional 10% of the ""initial potential refugees"" will leave in the next three months, giving an estimation of 4.8m + (18m * 10%) = 6.6m. There may be an event that triggers more departures (e.g. CBRN weapons). However, this is considered unlikey and current scenario suggests that Russia is focusing in key areas, which means less threatened population that will consider leaving their homes."
