If they were to meet the only chance I might see this happen is the coming up G20 Summit in Indonesia by ""bumbing accidently into each other"". And this asumes that both are attending. For Putin to come to the G20, I give it a chance of 18%. Putin has only leaft Russia on few occasions and met with other country leaders, which are at least on paper on Russia's side and in close proximity to Russia. So I don't he is willing to risk to have to confront a bunch of other country leaders, which are openly supporting Ukraine to various degrees, if they are actually willing to meet up him. It might be different, if Putin ceases to be Russian president but then it depends who would succeed, is it somebody from the war monger camp or somebody from the fraction which seriously wants to end this war. And the whole succession scenerio in my estimate has to unfold in a way that the next Russian president and the whole Kremlin crowd have by then sorted and realigned their allegiances and rivalries. This still would be a black box in peaceful times and this is Russia, so anything can happen and nothing is for certain. For Zelensky to attend something like a 4%. I don't think he is going to leave Ukraine as long fighting is continueing. I would say as a rule of thumb, Zelensky is not going abroard until it is safe to fly in and out of Ukraine. In case Zelensky ceases to be Ukrainian president (which only can mean sudden death or serious illness) not so much would change in that circumstances, cause the Ukrainians pretty much seem in consent there are no talks with the Russian side unless the Russians are out of the country or showing their willingness to retreat back over the internationally recognized border. So that makes 0.0072% that are both there. But nevertheless I make it generously 2%, because you know: It's Russia: You never know so anything can happen. And propably more important: I wanna be able to say (as a small ego treat): I saw the black swan when it still was in the black box."

His demands include the return of all Ukrainian territory. Russia increased tensions and showed greater resolve to gain and keep territory in Ukraine by partially mobilizing military reserves and taking steps to annex additional Ukrainian territory. The escalatory measures on both sides indicate they are moving in the opposite directions of any agreement and making a meeting between the two men less likely. @Julie-Kinloch - do you think Putin would meet Zelensky if it mean conceding territory or do you think his pride would not allow that to happen?

Just yesterday, occupation officials in the south and eastern parts of Ukraine (which identify strongly as ethnically Russian) announced they were putting together a referendum to make formal aceeding (peace) agreements with Russia. This puts them one step closer to annexation, which Putin would likely use to fuel further military volunteerism (or forced service) from the new ""Russian"" territory, as well as allow for Russian troops to further mobilize throughout the region. Since Zelensky has stated several times since the fighting began that there can be no peace talks until Russia removes its military forces from Ukraine's borders, I would consider it highly improbable that the two meet barring unforeseen circumstances that lead to either the complete withdrawal of Russian forces or the outright defeat of Ukrainian forces in the war."

Russia is sending constantly signals that is open for negotiations. The Ukraine is not sovereign by opinion of Russia. The Ukraine is also not sovereign as retainer of The West due to fact, that about 5 Billion US$ it is missing per month on state budget, due to fact that about 7 million Ukrainians live off EU countries budgets, due to fact that has not enough weapons, due to fact it has no weapon industry due to fact that about 80% of its BIP are located at occupied areas of Russia, due to fact that only by intelligence of USA it can survive in this war. I assume if the NATO Nations may press the Ukraine for negotiations they will happen immediately, because after 4 weeks the Ukraine is running out of all resources it needs to go ahead to fight this war. Therefore the President of USA, UK and some Members of NATO decide when the negotiations may begin from Ukraine side. This may happen soon in the next months like a probability of a falling coin by economic evaluations of the supporting countries. At the end of the day the Ukraine may need several hundreds billion for reconstruction.

Although negotiations can occur quickly, negotiations usually take a matter of weeks or months. The current conditions are stable enough to keep the conflict going without negotiations for some time. However, conditions could change that would lead to bringing one side to the table more quickly which increases the chances of this occurring.

However it's hard to see how Putin could position himself to take such a meeting domestically and internationally. On one hand domestically he could use it to A) show he's trying to be reasonable and B) actually make no concessions, however this would be problematic for him if he were then to find Russia losing entirely and being forced out of the country. I suspect that domestically there isn't much to be gained at this point unless the talks result in some concessions from the Ukraine side, but it certainly doesn't feel like negotiation from a position of strength from Russia's perspective.
