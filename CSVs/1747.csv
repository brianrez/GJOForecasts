However, budget questions and construction delays have cast doubt over the project (California High Speed Rail Authority, LA Times, National Review, Federal Railroad Administration). Some examples of approval include Congressional authorizations and appropriations, as well as decisions on grants by executive agencies. Funds do not have to be disbursed for the question to close as ""yes,"" they only need to be approved. Funding which was originally approved by the Obama administration will not count to resolve this question. Confused?
