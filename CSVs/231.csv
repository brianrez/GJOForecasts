Governor of an R+2 state and is running a campaign based on progressive populism and force of personality. Oz (R) is a television star with brand name recognition but no political experience and no real ties to PA other than real estate. Fetterman's campaign more or less stopped in its tracks when he suffered a stroke on the eve of the primaries. He won the nomination, but remained mostly out of public view until recently. He participated in a tv interview and a televised debate, both of which demonstrated he is still in recovery. The debate performance has generally been considered disastrous. There has been skepticism in recent years of the utility of debates and their effect on voters. This debate seems to have moved the needle. Prediction markets shifted dramatically, and polls were already starting to favor Oz after the interview. Whether or not voters will follow suit remains to be seen, but if momentum has shifted, then it hasn't shifted in favor of Fetterman. A crude averaging of the prediction markets, pollsters, and professional forecasters gives Oz an ever so slight advantage of 51-49. Anything can happen, but I think this trend will continue. 55-45, Oz."
