There is a small chance that bitcoin could substitute for a percentage, e.g., 10 to 25 percent, of the gold that is held as a store of value. This would greatly increase Bitcoin's value. However, this is unlikely because bitcoin uses a lot of electricity just to remain in existence; bitcoin cannot be used for any non-commerce purpose, e.g., gold jewelry, electronics,; and, bitcoin is at least twice as volatile and therefore more risky on the downside.

That said I would've said the same for the ~45k range as a support from the recent dips in February, March, and April. A lot of the narrative is also coming into question, with the Chinese government cracking down, Gensler and the SEC eyeing crypto, and its unclear how that will affect the institutional stance toward Bitcoin. Per JPMorgan the shift into crypto and away from gold has been reversing (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/19/big-institutional-investors-are-dumping-bitcoin-and-going-back-into-gold-jpmorgan-says.html), though Jamie Dimon does hate it so I do take it with a grain of salt."

The 2 ratios are 2.65 and 2.10. Assuming this season's peak has been 63k, it is possible that the retrospective trough from this season will be 63k / 2.65 = 23.8k < 25k. Since the previous drops occurred in 1 month, it also fits the July 1 time-frame for this forecast. However, Bitcoin is a much more financialized asset compared to those years, with the arrival of derivatives on BlockFI, KuCoin and elsewhere. I subjectively assume this provides a market mechanism to reduce the impact of a price fall by ~50%."

Prior research here suggested there's another support from orders placed around $28k though, and its hard to say if the dip will simply be bought again. The main yes case for below $25k is a narrative arising of the ""digital gold"" narrative being disproven by the recent volatility maybe attributable to Elon Musk. The issue is I don't know how much of the purchasing was people who actually believe in digital gold vs. people speculating on other people believing it, since both positions would encourage people to promote the idea in similar ways. There's also people speculating on Bitcoin because its volatile and conceptually simple. If the digital gold narrative being disproven becomes a narrative itself then it'd be a lot more impactful if most of the purchasing is speculative, people who actually believe in digital gold would probably be less phased by volatility (...it's Bitcoin, volatility isn't new). On the other hand speculation on other people's beliefs would probably be a lot more sensitive to new narratives since its all second-hand and its more difficult to think for people who aren't yourself."
