This year Bale made a transformation to become Vice-President Dick Cheney which did very well in the box office making $55.7 million dollars. As for Rami Malek he won at the Golden Globes beating out Cooper and is played Queen frontman Freddie Mercury. However, A Star is Born and Coopers performance were very popular at the box office making $417 million dollars which is why I gave him at least 10%."
