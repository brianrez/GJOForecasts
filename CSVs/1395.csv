"On 29 June 2018, how many public hydrogen fueling stations will be available in the United States?",2018-02-28T18:00:53Z,2018-06-29T06:59:53Z,Fewer than 45,"['Fewer than 45', 'Between 45 and 55, inclusive', 'More than 55']","['Technology', 'Society', 'Environment']",435,654,195,237,"Hydrogen fueling infrastructure is expanding (U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC)). Air Liquide, in partnership with Toyota, has announced the creation of a chain of 12 hydrogen fueling stations in the Northeast, stretching from New York to Boston (NY Times). Honda has also announced that an additional 36 stations will be built in California (LA Times). The State of California has earmarked $200 million for as many as 100 new hydrogen stations in the next several years, and car manufacturers and energy providers are working together to make it happen (Green Tech Media). This question will be resolved using data for public hydrogen fueling stations from the AFDC. Confused?

Reports as of May 18, 2017 said that the first station would be open by the end of 2017, but the data from the AFDC shows no stations yet open in the Northeast. This leads me to believe this project is going slower than the originally projected timeline and will not be able to boost the number of stations over 45 before June 2018. The additional California stations mentioned seem to be opening slowly as well. On May 18th last year there were 30 and now currently are 34. At that rate, it is unlikely the number of stations will exceed 45 before 29 June, 2018."

So far, California is the only place in North America where drivers can buy a fuel cell vehicle and have some confidence they can get it refueled. “Competition is pretty scarce right now,” says Shane Stephens, chief development officer of FirstElement Fuel Inc., which built 16 of California’s 31 stations with $28 million in state grants. Most of the existing single-pump stations can fill 50 tanks to 60 tanks a day. Sometimes there’s a wait at the pumps, but mostly the nozzles hang limp, devoid of cars to feed. On the occasions when two or more cars line up to fill at the same time, the second car typically has to wait an extra few minutes after the first car is done, because gas pumped under high pressure begins to freeze a single pump’s nipple, condensing moisture from the air into ice. Several newer, two-pump stations have helped address this problem, but California still needs more trucks to deliver supplies of hydrogen for the stations. (The state is subsidizing the refills for eight years.)"

By the timeline provided, it shows everything listed as ""commissioning"" should be completed by 29 JUN, and even a project in LA in construction phase could make it. On page 25 of the annual assessment (1) from CAFCP, it shows that there is an average of 261 days from beginning of construction to completion and availability to the public. The LAX project started in May of 2017, So it is already beyond this point but still listed as ""under construction""(2). The same document(1) shows that organizations with construction completed should only have about 66 days to when the site is open to the public. It is unclear though if the three sites listed as ""commissioning""(2) are actually considered in ""Phase 4"", (the 66 day phase). Phase 3 is described as, ""This phase includes station construction and meeting operational requirements: the station has a hydrogen fuel supply, passes a hydrogen quality test, dispenses at the H70-T40 pressure and temperature per standard (SAE J2601), successfully fuels one FCEV, and receives the occupancy permit from the AHJ."""
