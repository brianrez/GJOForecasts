The United Kingdom's planned exit from the EU has caused some Scottish leaders to call for another vote on independence, less than two years after nearly 56 percent of voters cast ballots against it (Reuters, The Telegraph, Scotland's Referendum). Recommended Questions Before 1 July 2017, will any other European Union (EU) member state set a date for a referendum on leaving the EU? When will the United Kingdom invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty? What will the end-of-day closing value for the British pound against the US dollar be on 30 December 2016?",https://www.gjopen.com/questions/236-before-1-july-2017-will-scotland-set-a-date-for-another-referendum-on-independence-from-the-united-kingdom

Geographically, that would leave Northern Ireland sandwiched between two EU countries and that would be unacceptable for the United Kingdom. The separation of Scotland from the UK would likely crash the economy of Northern Ireland because of lack of tourist euros or pounds sterling and the Northern Ireland loyalists would be up in arms, possibly violently. Also, Scottish secession would be very embarrassing for the monarchs. The monarchs rarely exhibit power on political issues, but this would be an appropriate time because of Prince Philip's position as Duke of Edinburgh."

So this question can be resolved as yes under two scenarios: (1) the UK and Scottish governments agree on a Section 30 text and Holyrood sets a date, or (2) the Scottish (government or parliament) sets a date for a non-binding referendum. The chances of (1) by July 1 are slim but not zero - after the 69-59 vote, stubbornly opposing the will of the Scottish parliament may be seen as deeply undemocratic. The chances of (2) are higher, but not overwhelming either - a non-binding vote may be seen as a way to put pressure on the UK government to agree on Section 30, but also comes with the risk of low participation that might validate the UK's resistance. The most likely outcome seems continuing discussions, but no resolution by July 1. But if Theresa May agrees in principle to the idea of a referendum, Sturgeon can wait a bit for the date."

She has been beating the ""we are leaving the UK"" drum heavily since the Brexit result. From her perspective, she has two reasons for wishing to go ahead with this quickly. One: The earlier she manages to leave Britain, the more in sync Scottish law and EU law will be. Second: If she manages to get a referendum quickly, she will have the highest chance of success. Since most scots voted against Brexit, the temporary emotions in all this would play in her favor. If she waits too long and Britain succeeds after leaving the EU, she would be in a much worse position. In addition, if she gets a referendum while Britain is busy with the Brexit process, she can be assured that her political opponents would be preoccupied, allowing her to campaign more easily."
498,2017-03-21T02:12:03Z,5,[6.0],[0.0],"It's possible that it may come down to specific wording within the legislation. It is my understanding that in the case of the Brexit legislation, Parliament ceded discretion to the PM to set the date. It is conceivable the Holyrood legislation might include some reference to a date, or a period of time. Thus the two legislations might not be directly comparable. Would not setting a time frame, or window, be setting a date? Again, if the mechanism is different (i.e., unlike the PM, the discretion of the First Minister might be limited), you can't really use the Brexit legislation as a comparable. One was not fixed in any way; the other might be fixed in some way."

However, I believe that the Scottish Parliament (SP) does not have the power to decide on having a referendum, Westminster holds the power for that. Hence even if the SP votes FOR, there is a lot to be negotiated between Scottish and UK govt before a date is set. The answer to this question also depends on the meaning of ""will Scotland set"": technically the date will not be set by Scotland alone but by a combination of Westminster and SP decisions as well as a Royal Assent (if the same procedure is followed as previously). Given these complications, the probability for a definitive date as of 1/7/17 remains low but if the interpretation is ""the date set by the SP"", it is possible that it will happen by the deadline.

He was repeatedly pressed by the interviewer on the question of a second referendum, and repeatedly dodged answering it. Now - you could say: the decision is not his to make, it is Sturgeon's, and it is true also that the SNP operates more or less on ""democratic centralist"" lines these days - being very careful to avoid public dissent or gun-jumping - but his reluctance to engage on the matter seemed quite unusual for him, and perhaps telling."

On 16 October 2016, the Scottish Government published a draft bill that would enable a second Scottish independence referendum to occur, after receiving legislative consent. The Scottish Independence Referendum Bill draft is largely similar to its sister act of 2013, and has been put out for consultation by the government to allow the public to convey their views on the wording and procedures of the bill. 2. As the constitution is a 'reserved' matter under the Scotland Act 1998, for a future referendum on Scottish independence to be binding under UK law, it would need to receive the consent of the British Parliament to take place. 3. The Scotland Act 1998 empowers the Scottish Parliament to legislate in policy areas devolved to Scotland, but one of its clauses obliges the Scottish Parliament to ensure its legislation is compatible with European law. For the UK to completely leave the EU, it would need to remove that obligation. If the UK Parliament wishes to legislate on policy areas devolved to Scotland, or if it wishes to amend the powers devolved to Scotland, by convention it needs the Scottish Parliament to pass a ""legislative consent motion"". 4. Media reports suggested this might give the Scottish Parliament a veto over UK withdrawal from the EU, but under the Scotland Act 1998 the UK Parliament could ultimately override the ""veto"" as it is based only on parliamentary convention. ____________________________________ COMMENT: There are so many issues to iron out before a referendum can take place. Nicola Sturgeon is right to strike while the iron is hot, but the timing is too short. Although one you should always be careful of the wording. ""Set a Date"" is what we need before 30 June. Still too early in my view. Moving to a more prudent forecast."

Support for a new independence referendum is likely to be driven by a poor deal being struck for the UK by Brexit negotiators. More specifically it will be driven by a poor deal for Scotland. It's in SNP interests to wait to see what kind of deal the UK is likely to get. Nicola Sturgeon's comments yesterday that a soft Brexit could take a referendum off the table for now further support the notion that they are waiting to see what deal the UK gets as a soft Brexit is unlikely to stir the mood of the Scottish electorate sufficiently to boost the prospects of a victory in a new referendum. She has to be very careful as the SNP have potentially been given a gift with Brexit and must ensure they don't blow their shot.

Scotland policy makers wanted to actually put this up for a vote they would almost certainly wait for the UK to trigger article 50 (which probably happens in March) plus see what the initial wave or negotiations bring up. Then they would debate it in their own parliament to see if the whole thing should actually go up for a vote. THEN would have to pick a date etc... Seems unlikely they would be in a hurry to get the ball rolling when actual 'Brexit' is still years (2020?) off of bein official."

Sturgeon also met with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, who commented that ""I will listen carefully to what the first minister will tell me... but we don't have the intention, neither Donald Tusk nor myself, to interfere in an inner British process that is not our duty and this is not our job."" Manfred Weber, leader of the European People's Party Group, and Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group, indicated that they were supportive of Scotland remaining an EU member. Gunther Krichbaum, head of the Bundestag's Committee for EU Affairs, made supportive comments about Scotland becoming a member state of the EU. However, She does NOT have the support of French president Hollande (who cares about him now) and Spanish PM Rajoy (because of his own problems with Catalonia)."

For these reasons, unless Scotland somehow negotiates a deal to remain within the Single Market or the EU, or further powers are devolved to the Scottish Parliament, I believe a referendum will be called as it will be viewed as a sound course of action both ideologically, and to bolster the negotiating power of Scotland."

Indisputably, a significant number of Scotland desires independence. However, the polls show that the wishes of the public have not shifted much, following the Brexit vote, from the results of the earlier independence referendum. Moreover, the oil prices and the high cost of production of the North Sea (one of the higher, if not the highest regions), will make the public finances of an independent Scotland harder. What in effect Scots have to decide is to break away from the UK seeking a better future with the EU - there does not seem a lot of independence in that. And the EU did not appear overly enthusiastic to support this, some countries, like Spain, were outright against it. On top of all that, the second independence will have to go through the Westminster, yet another obstacle. Still, Sturgeon, will probably want to keep a significant part of the supporters on her side - after all this was what she promised. It may also be a tactical move to cultivate this option as a negotiating chip with Westminster. Despite the near impossibility of second referendum under these conditions, these may well change and in order to reflect that a 5% probability has been assigned to it."

For one, the UK appears to be reluctant to invoke Article 50 due to the economic and regulatory uncertainty that it could potentially generate in the near term. In addition, negotiating new trade deals with the EU will be a laborious process and could put off investment in the short-run and reduce the potential growth trajectory of the UK in the long run, due to increased tariffs and non-tariff barriers.

14493,2016-07-28T17:02:37Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"The question seems to assume that ""Scotland"" can set a date for another referendum on independence. An Independence referendum is a UK Constitutional matter. Constitutional matters have not been devolved to the Scottish Parliament (""Scotland"") but are reserved by the UK Parliament in Westminster. Therefore before Scotland could set a date for a referendum the Westminster Parliament would have to pass legislation authorising it. There seems to be no appetite by the UK government to authorise another referendum. Therefore in order for anyone to set a date for another referendum would require (a) The Scottish Parliament to decide that there was a very high probability of winning a 2nd independence referendum (b) the Scottish government demanding that events had meant that the results of the first referendum should be ignored and request that Westminster authorise a 2nd referendum (c) something to happen to change the UK government's mind. Although the UK has voted for Brexit, which could be considered grounds for holding a 2nd referendum, as yet it is totally unclear what form Brexit will be (or indeed if it will actually happen). Until it is clear what form Brexit will take it will remain equally unclear what impact, if any, it would have on Scotland there are not really any grounds for holding a 2nd Scottish referendum. Coupled with this the problems that are arising from having a Brexit referendum that only established what the voters did not want (they did not want to be in the EU) but did not actually establish what relationship, if any, voters wanted the UK to have with the EU. It can now be seen that there is a very high probability that having voted for Brexit, whatever relationship between the UK and EU results, a majority of voters will be unhappy with the outcome (e.g. if 48% did not want to leave, 10% want no deal with the EU at all, 10% want to be in the EEA, and 32% want some other arrangement then it will not be possible to give the majority what they want). The 1st Scottish referendum was a vague as the UK EU referendum, now with the benefit of the Brexit vote it is likely that Scottish Independence voters would want to vote for something more concrete than just leaving the UK, they would expect to be voting for a specific relationship with both the UK and EU. It is probable that by July 2017 it will still be unclear what the relationship between the UK and EU will be."

(their own currency, legislation, parliament, elections, etc.) Low probability H1 2017, which would more than double till Q2 2018 in my point of view."

I think this will be strongly influenced with whether GB executes Article 50. Lets say they do. Scotland strongly wants to remain in the EU, so there is a good chance (85%) they will have another referendum. Further, they want the referendum with sufficient time before the UK exits the EU, which will fulfill this questions timetable. I am guessing 50% chance Article 50 gets executed this year. On the other hand, if Article 50 doesn't get executed, I strongly suspect that Scotland will take a wait and see attitude. 50% (assuming Article 50 is executed) of 85% (Will Scotland have a vote or not), rounded up a bit, is 45%.
