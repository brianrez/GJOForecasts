Had the figure been any higher than 94k I would edge the forecast down out of caution, but it still appears very likely to me that sales for May will be marginally stronger or similar to those in the prior months, creating either a reduction in inventory or at least reducing the possibility for stocks to grow much more in the short term. Historically inventories have declined between April and May due to increased seasonal demand outstripping production capacity more each year (2018-2021), and while we are in very strange times (interest rates rising, economies forecasting no growth or recession, continuing supply-chain issues alongside a major climate crisis and a war in Ukraine creating severe consequences in all sorts of areas) I still expect this basic premise to hold to some extent. These balancing factors have been in play for the last few months, with stock levels remaining fairly steady, so very worst case I'd expect perhaps 150% the increase from March to April, which would be circa 98k. There have been some strange late upsets in other questions, but I still don't see the picture changing that much just yet."

Several manufacturers have reported that the chip crisis will not be solved before 2022Q3, so we do not expect a significant change in supply. On the demand side, it is interesting to consider the ""Auto Inventory/Sales Ratio"" indicator (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=AISRSA,#) last value of 0.242. This indicator can be considered an estimation of ""average number of months it takes to sell cars in current inventory"". The usual value until February 21 was 2 or higher. According to this interpretation, before February 21 a car usually stayed 2 months in inventory before being sold, but nowadays it only stays for less than a week. Therefore, we have huge unbalance beteween supply and demand. I do not expect inventories are above 100k in May 21, unless we have an unexpected event that sharply reduces demand."

Even assuming the chip shortage eases up and production jumps, there is, presumably, a backlog of demand to be filled. Anecdotally people are driving great distances and paying thousands above sticker price to get new cars right now, but people with less urgent needs who would still like a new car can simply wait."

If inventory continues to fall or at least remain <40 through Feb, and worldwide production doesn't ramp up hugely, then that will make bin 2 look less likely to me, as pent-up demand will absorb new production and likely keep inventories very depressed for at least some more months to come. Even before the pandemic, inventories were decreasing; they've been on a decreasing trend since May 2017. The pandemic is pushing below that trend."

As supply bottlenecks hopefully start to ease over the next 6 months, I suspect that any increase in supply will be quickly annihilated by pent-up demand, and it's not clear whether supplies will top 100k for some time to come."

But the aluminum shortage is deepening with the energy crisis in China and will soon to be drastically worse because of upcoming magnesium shortages also due to the Chinese energy crisis. As a result, I'm less optimistic than the crowd."

Max out the graph(starts at 1993-01-01) to take a look at changes after the past US recessions for the month of May(2001, 2008- 2009) it took about 2 years to surpass 2001 lows and 2008(lowest point) -2009 took about 4 years(from 2008). I didn’t crunch the numbers to confirm but it doesn’t appear that May is the strongest month for inventory so I wouldn’t expect a large outlier leap if numbers are low early in 2022."
