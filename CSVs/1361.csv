Everything it does is going to be closely regulated, if not in the US then in other territories (e.g. the EU). What data Facebook collects on users will be regulated. Who Facebook makes user data available to will be regulated. The veracity of posts by users will be regulated. The removal of illegal posts will be regulated. Facebook will be responsible for illegal acts carried out via its platforms. In short Facebook and other social media sites will be treated other forms of media. This will affect its costs and probably reduce its share price."

Though they have made missteps, they still have many resources and have overcome challenges in the past. The platform is simply too widespread to permanently impair global promise of future returns. Also, many of the challenges are in the US & EU, yet FB's worldwide opportunities continue to grow and mature in many other regional markets - and situation that, taken as a whole, offset some of the offsets in US/EU business operations. Consider that FB's customer & consumer base outside of US/EU is larger & that this portion economically is growing on a per capita basis."

The range from 500-570 is pretty wide and current value is quite close to the center so there is a decent chance of staying within this range. It would take 7.8% price increase to get over 570. According to Bloomberg 1yr return on FB was about 7%. With only 141 days to go having price increase y almost 8% is not too likely. On the other hand it might come back a bit after recent sell of. It is hard to balance the momentum in tech stocks and possibility that market is irrationally overextended. In the end I decided it's 10% chance to clear 570B cap.

Aussuming modest Recovery makes 500 to 570 sound reasonable. Unexpected growth or new shares issuance can break the 570 limit. In case customers withdraw in larger numbers, or further leaks occur it might come out below 500 or even 430"

I see two reasons to think that is too high. First the P/E of most US stocks is higher than the historic norms, which suggests at some point US stocks can be expected to fall back to historic norms (they always say ""its different this time, they will not fall"", but they always do). The second reason is that Facebook's business model is having to change. The fact that the US politicians seems to have no idea what that business model was possibly indicates that some investors are equally ignorant, but it is clear that the world is changing. Users and regulators are taking a lot of interest in social media, ""free"" services, ownership of personal data, and who can do what with it, fake news, racist, sexist and illegal comments, interference in democracy, the high profits and low taxes paid by the companies. Facebook has so many users who spend so much time using it that the likelihood of more usage does not seem very likely, but even before the CA issue the hours of usage in the US was already dropping. And had dropped a lot among the younger age groups. There are reports that 10% of US user have left in the last few weeks (some may come back, other may leave). The average hours of use will probably continue to fall in the US and within the next year or two will probably start dropping worldwide. All social media companies will need to employ a lot more people policing their sites as they will increasing be required to clean up their act. If the US is slow to act the EU shows signs of forcing the pace (why not? Facebook takes business from European firms, but does not employ many Europeans or pay much European tax, making life uncomfortable for Facebook is a win/win for every European politician, believer in driving out fake news, and raising tax (or fines)). Other countries around the world will take note of the control that China has over social media, and wondering why they don't follow suit. So bashing Facebook is something that liberals and conservatives can agree on. I don't think the Facebook investors have seen the train coming, they are standing on the tracks thinking nothing happened."
