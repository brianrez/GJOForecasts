So this would let Beijinb signal to the world that the security law would not interfere with Hong Kong's self-governance. But it's the security law that the world is angry about because that represents infringement on self-governance. Reasons Beijing manages the results to prevent a pro-democracy majority 1)Trump may not be President in 2021 so consolidate while it can 2)already signaled a heavy hand with the security law 3)arrested persons under the security law 4) By awarding seats to loyalists the Party passes out favors. So since the security law is not going to be repealed there's nothing gained by signaling free elections equals self-governance. So I am more than 50 50 on the yes no split but not 100% certain.
