Spain's first death occurred on March 3rd, 30 days ago. If we extrapolate an exponential function from this to find the death rate and predict death counts for future days, using f(x) = a(b)^x, we get 10,348 = 1(b)^30, which simplifies to a death rate of the 30th root of 10,348, which is 36%. If we are optimistic and assume that Spain's lockdown will cut transmission and thus death rates by 50%, giving us a death rate of 18% going forward, and want to find the number of deaths on May 1st, which is 31 days from now, we can use the expression 10,348(1.18)^31 to come to a total number of 1,750,647 deaths. Of course there are many other factors that will lower the death count such as the building of new hospitals, increased efficiency of social distancing among the population, an increased medical supply, etc, one can be 100% confident any measures could be enacted this late in the timeline to reduce that death count below 15,000. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/spain/."

Their situation on 3 March was similar to Spain today, taking about their absolute growth for the weeks to follow, we should be at about 10000 cases in Spain by 1 May. SK was very strict in testing and especially isolating, so I consider that the bottom line. They got it under control early, which isn´t certain for Spain, so there is some potential upwards. On the other hand they are very strict now, so it could happen. Thats´s about 3rd and 4th bucket. If it got really out of control (and that can happen, because there are more cases of local spreading than in SK), it would easily go beyond 15000. Will have to adjust this to new numbers every few days."
