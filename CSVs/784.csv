The league has been in a bubble for a while now, and given that there have been no players that have contracted covid in the Orlando bubble (https://www.bulletsforever.com/2020/7/21/21332646/nba-coronavirus-orlando-bubble-no-positive-cases), especially with all of the media coverage and expectation around the season start."
92822,2020-07-27T23:29:55Z,1,[99.0],[99.0],"The bubble has been beautifully constructed. Two weeks ago not a single player tested positive, which means that community spread is completely impossible, and anyone that leaves the bubble must go through a minimum 4 day quarantine process, up to 10 days. They have been playing pre-season scrimmages with no issues. Any changes would require someone to effectively leave the bubble, get covid, and sneak back without getting caught, and then infect several players. I put this at a very low probability. Other reasons for postponement, would be a famous death (if a player dies), issues related to race relations (Which has cooled off significantly since June), or some other tail events. I put these at < 1% but enough to not make it 100%."

As of 27 July 2020, the NBA has demonstrated that they will do whatever it takes to keep the players safe in order to open up again. They have quarantined players who have not tested, who have gotten takeout, and who have demonstrated that they have done anything risky. With how close we are towards the opening date, and everything already prepared and ready for resuming, there is very little doubt in my mind about this."

92812,2020-07-27T15:16:01Z,1,[97.0],[97.0],"NBA scrimmages have been occurring for 5 days so far, without any major challenges due to coronavirus. This makes my prior close to 100% for the season resuming as planned. However, there have been reports of players leaving the bubble or forgetting to take coronavirus tests and being placed in quarantine (Lou Williams: https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/07/26/clippers-lou-williams-in-10-day-nba-quarantine-after-stop-at-atlanta-strip-club/, Kristaps Porzingas: https://sports.yahoo.com/dallas-mavericks-kristaps-porzingis-forgot-take-coronavirus-covid19-test-nba-bubble-quarantine-230920727.html). While these cases are few, they may make the NBA wary about how many players are actually obeying the quarantine. The chance of postponing due to this is slim, but there are several more scrimmages to come, so I lowered my prior by 3% to 97%."
92801,2020-07-27T15:14:55Z,1,[99.0],[99.0],"Scrimmages have been running smoothly for a few days now. No reports of positive tests in the bubble have been made (out of almost 350 players). The league has shown an inclination to deal with breaches seriously; Lou Williams was recently put on a 10-day quarantine after leaving the bubble (which means he will miss the first two seeding games), and many players have been giving one-day quarantines for missing designated tests. With the July 30 start happening before the weekend, I see the probability of a delay very low, barring tail events."
93030,2020-07-27T15:13:59Z,1,[98.0],[98.0],"The resuming of the NBA season looks extraordinarily likely with the onset of the start day looming in just 3 days; however, we can't discount the high degree of susceptibility to a singular disruption of the NBA bubble. Thus, I'm leaving 2% of likelihood to account for a sudden outbreak within the bubble that immediately leads to the postponement of the season. We've witnessed two MLB games be postponed amid the Marlins' COVID outbreak. Nonetheless, if any players acts out and somehow contracts the disease, I have strong faith that the NBA has set up extensive protocols to limit those tail cases especially due to the critical economic incentive of a normal resumption of the season."

The season is scheduled to begin in only 3 days now, and the signs that could indicate a delayed start are mostly going away. The current weather forecast for Thursday (July 30) in Orlando (which should be reasonably accurate given only a three day gap) is Sunny/partly cloudy with about a 20% chance of rain, so a weather delay also seems very unlikely by this point. The risks of ""bubble contamination"" have also lessened with time, as xguo refers to in their post."

92813,2020-07-27T00:09:55Z,1,[99.0],[99.0],"It seems like from the current set up, statistics released, and how the NBA is handling and dealing with players breaking quarantine, it seems very likely that things will continue to run smoothly and that the season will start on time. The most recent NBA player test resulted in 0 positive cases out of 346 players, and even the most recent one before that where results for 322 players tested on July 7 (results announced July 13) resulted in only 2 positive tests. Also, it seems like anyone that might be a likely suspect for breaking covid had already tested positive before even coming to the bubble (e.g. Jokic, who blatantly was seen hanging around Djokovic in Europe, Djokovic being a serious covid-denier). And, it seems like any breaches of quarantine / bubble are being taken seriously as well: for example, Richaun Holmes who briefly and barely left to simply pick up some food was forced to undergo another two week quarantine (Jul 13), and Lou Williams who left to attend his granfather's funeral and strip club was also mandated a 10-day quarantine after discovery. Now, there is still an extremely low chance that someone could leave completely undiscovered, but it seems like weekends would be the most likely time for that to happen and it being a Sunday night with no news released, being only 5 days out from the proposed July 30 start makes it nearly improbable that something will happen to force the NBA to delay the July 30 season re-start."
92809,2020-07-26T21:45:24Z,1,[97.0],[97.0],"Summary: We are quickly approaching the settlement date of this question, and the NBA appears determined to begin the season despite growing Covid case numbers in Florida, Texas, and California. While this appeared less likely earlier in the question's lifecycle, the NBA's stance has not changed - even positive test results from Kevin Durant and Deandre Jordan, as well as 12 other players, have not fazed them. The reference class for this type of question would be other sports leagues in the US - the NFL continues to push forward with their 2020 season (starting Sept. 10), and the MLB and NHL are following suit, with the NHL creating their own bubble in Edmonton. More importantly than setting the stage for other sports, the NBA is attempting to salvage part of the estimated $1 billion in losses on revenue from Covid. The stakes look extremely high for them, as they've rented out a Walt Disney amusement park and heavily marketed the beginning of the upcoming season (estimated investment of $170 million) - their Twitter account continues to promote the beginning of the season 4 days from now. In summary, the NBA's willingness to continue with the season despite over a dozen players testing positive and a second wave appearing cross the US, shows a determination to run this season as planned."

Therefore the information from other sports leagues may not be a good ""base rate"" estimation for this prediction. Given that NBA already invested heavily in the preparation work and the staffs are well-equipped, only unforeseeable catastrophic development could further postpone the NBA season."

Currently, no ""Good News"" is needed to confirm the resuming of the NBA season, but for a delay/cancellation, ""Bad News"" is needed. There has been little news in the last 10 days that at all suggests the NBA will not reopen; there have been a couple of players who have decided to leave the bubble and rumors of a player sneaking out, but it seems mostly under control. If we deem ""waiting for Bad News"" as the main factor to turn the answer into No, then because half the time until the start has passed, my probability of No should be about half of what it was in my original forecast (i.e going from ""10% No"" to ""5% No""). However, several factors that weren't as predictable 19 days beforehand are now more easily predicted; for example, the probability of a bad hurricane to cause a delay within the next week is much less likely than it was a week ago (weather forecasts are more accurate a week in advance). Several NBA insiders, such as Mark Cuban, also seem pretty sure the season will continue as scheduled.

NBA's return-to-play guidelines and their social bubble in Orlando have been widely praised by many health experts on the comprehensive nature of their COVID precautions. The NBA as a whole is encouraging and essentially demanding the reopening of the NBA and will likely do so unless a substantial portion of the league is unable to participate. Of the 20 projected starting players of these games, all have continued to test negative and remain quarantining. The recent news of 2 players testing positive and breaking quarantine may demonstrate that there is reason to suspect other NBA players may also break quarantine. However, due to heightened security and the realized knowledge that the NBA is actually taking action to isolate and prevent these players from playing means that players are probably going to be less likely to break official rules. On social media, Kawhi (Clippers) and LBJ (Lakers) at least have come out publicly to condemn those not wearing masks and taking precautions in Orlando as well as recognizing the risk of COVID, even within the bubble. As two of the teams with some of the highest chances of winning the playoffs, both desire/have an incentive to be extra cautious (e.g. Lakers choosing to forgo bringing much of their staff to decrease the odds of spread)."

I operated under the assumption that since the quarantine period was over, all players were cleared to play. However, this news release came out today and thus made me reconsider this notion). I attribute a 5% decrease in probability due to this. 2. Richaun Holmes broke quarantine to pick up food, demonstrating that NBA players breaking the rules is an actionable probability. While Holmes is placed again on quarantine, it would only take one unguarded infection to shelf the season. However, I think due to this happening, there may be heightened security , which puts a ceiling to this decrease. I thus attribute this news as 2.5%. 3. Florida weather patterns.

92803,2020-07-12T03:00:00Z,1,[87.0],[87.0],"Prior: I looked into European and Asian sports leagues' restarting timeline and the factors that influenced their reopening. In particular, 2 factors seem to be the most important: 1) government green light on resuming 2) teams quarantining together 2-3 weeks before the competition. As long as these two conditions are met and the leagues having announced official start date, the start rate is 100% (I might have missed some smaller leagues so could be an adverse selection bias here, will keep checking on this). For NBA, these two factors likely won't be an issue: 1) Florida has been one of the more aggressive states in opening back up, and DeSantis is very firm on this. Also given that the government okayed arrangements like the Citadel bubble, it probably would not get in the way of NBA. 2) all 22 teams are in a bubble as of today (7/11). So my prior is 98%, revised down due to possible adverse selection."

In addition, there will be no audiences in any of these games and essentially NBA players and game workers are live inside a self-contained professional bubble."
