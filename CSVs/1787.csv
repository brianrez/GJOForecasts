Is there anything to mitigate these facts? For instance, many political expectations have been overturned over the past year. Trump is not a part of the Republican establishment and Rubio may be carving out some space for himself as a leader of legislators who want to assert their independence from Trump.

32012,2017-01-15T18:15:35Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],"Rex Tillerson faces a vocal but seriously weakened opposition from environmentalists who oppose the possibility/probability that he could undermine their hopes and dreams of promoting alternative energy as a major component of alleviating the impact of climate change. Perhaps, a more readily transparent and critical concern that could lead to scuttling his appointment revolves around his close ties with Putin and Exxon's economic stakes in Russia as well as in the Middle East. These issues have aroused concern of many Republicans (most vocally Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham) who could join a majority of Democrats to block his appointment. I believe that Tillerson's depth of awareness concerning international conditions he has had to contend with in his long tenure at Exxon allows him to effectively answer difficult questions that, coupled with his basic gravitas, will at the end of the day, win Senate approval. I, as a committed opponent of dependence on fossil fuels, paradoxically believe that Tillerson will have the political savvy to convince President elect Trump that he should not remove US participation from continuing in its current role as a member of the Paris Climate Agreement."

32445,2017-01-11T21:09:02Z,1,[55.0],[55.0],If Trump likes him then why wouldn't he put Tillerson in as secretary of state. It seems like a hot topic but I think Trump likes the ties with Russia

32429,2017-01-11T18:32:11Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],He will be approved because the house and senate are mainly Republican so it will make it easy.
32427,2017-01-11T17:54:28Z,1,[85.0],[85.0],Trump is a major businessman and would love to have another one of his kind in the office. I think it is very likely that he will be approved for office.

32432,2017-01-11T16:28:20Z,1,[73.0],[73.0],I think that Rex will be confirmed in the first 100 days because of the fact that he is a important man and he could be futile in the future on board with the senate. He will be chosen.
32433,2017-01-11T16:24:55Z,1,[50.0],[50.0],Yes because trump wants to get him in office as soon as possible

32423,2017-01-11T16:00:15Z,1,[25.0],[25.0],I think that there is a chance he will be secretary but there will be strong opposition from the Republican party.

32393,2017-01-11T05:18:13Z,1,[80.0],[80.0],Yes because Trump is very similar to Tillerson as in they are both wealthy business and I believe Trump would like having Tillerson by his side.

32366,2017-01-11T03:33:30Z,1,[33.0],[33.0],"The only reason he wouldn't be confirmed is because he has no experience with being a secretary, hes worked on engenering and growing his buissness.

32389,2017-01-11T03:28:04Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],Trump is a Republican and with republicans dominating Congress I think it will be very likely that he gets approved. Also Trump would love another businessman in his staff.
32386,2017-01-11T03:26:32Z,1,[85.0],[85.0],I think he will be because he is a businessman that Trump will definitely want in office as soon as possible to begin work and Trump has a habit of putting on people that the country may not necessarily like.
32388,2017-01-11T03:25:21Z,1,[85.0],[85.0],Trump wants other business men around him that most likely share his views and can vouch on his side so therefore I think it is highly likely this happens.
32387,2017-01-11T03:18:20Z,1,[17.0],[17.0],I think that it will take a little longer than a couple months but eventually I believe that Rex Tillerson will be approved as secretary of state because the republicans dominate Congress.
32385,2017-01-11T03:17:37Z,1,[80.0],[80.0],"I think it is highly likely Tillerman will be confirmed by senate as there is a republican majority that will likely allow all of Trumps decisions to pass.

32381,2017-01-11T03:03:28Z,1,[89.0],[89.0],I think this is likely to happen because there is no rational reason why the nomination would not be approved.
32373,2017-01-11T02:59:52Z,1,[85.0],[85.0],"Trump is a ""Businessman,"" so I'm sure he would love to have another Businessman in his back pocket during presidency. Being chairman of such a large, important, powerful company for so long must come with perks that Rex would be willing to share if that meant a job for him in Government. I can guarantee that those perks will be taken into consideration when deciding whether or not to confirm him as secretary of state."
32382,2017-01-11T02:56:06Z,1,[90.0],[90.0],this is very likely because just because people have been critisizing him being the senate it will still happen
32384,2017-01-11T02:54:32Z,1,[90.0],[90.0],Trump wants business men like him surrounding him so he will probably get approved and start the job.
32353,2017-01-11T02:53:20Z,1,[55.0],[55.0],"He may be very popular, but he has too many ties to Russia so that might hurt him."

32376,2017-01-11T02:25:59Z,1,[89.0],[89.0],I am making this forecast because i believe that there is no one else eligible for secretary of state in my opinion.
32370,2017-01-11T02:19:48Z,1,[50.0],[50.0],I am completely split on this one. He is very liked for his high education and he is just a very popular man. His ties with Russia might ruin that for him. It will end up coming down to where people end up standing when the votes are counted.
32284,2017-01-11T02:15:12Z,1,[95.0],[95.0],Yes because hearings are this week.
32371,2017-01-11T02:12:15Z,1,[65.0],[65.0],"I think he will be appointed as secretary of the state, but there is some doubt from me also because he has pro-russia views so that might stop some people of the senate not wanting him as secretary of state."
32367,2017-01-11T01:47:24Z,1,[55.0],[55.0],Yes. That's who Trump wants the most and he has received who and what he wanted so far.
32365,2017-01-11T01:36:55Z,1,[45.0],[45.0],If Donald Trump is not impeached because of his ties to Russia
32357,2017-01-11T01:27:24Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],Despite his ties to Russia Tillerson might have good ideas and views on different subjects. It all depends if enough of people like and trust him.
32361,2017-01-11T01:17:13Z,1,[70.0],[70.0],yes i think that he will due to his education and popularity.
32175,2017-01-11T01:16:28Z,1,[80.0],[80.0],"Trump likes a show and being disputed over. It is only natural for him to nominate controversial people to these high ranking positions. Although Tillerson is slightly unfavored by both parties, this does not deny the fact that he could have some important views and possible solutions to the subject of climate change."
32306,2017-01-11T01:15:48Z,1,[66.0],[66.0],I think that he will be confirmed by the senate because he is well educated and well liked.
32359,2017-01-11T01:09:02Z,1,[60.0],[60.0],"It may be fought on, but I think he'll win in the end."
32360,2017-01-11T01:04:01Z,1,[55.0],[55.0],it is unlikely that he will be secretary of state because democrats and republicans have all expressed concerns about him be inducted into the secretary of state.
32344,2017-01-11T00:44:54Z,1,[85.0],[85.0],"If he has a better record while serving under a government I will have no issue with his appointment but since he's had no experience in politics and likely to be the first and last person as a secretary of state who has no working experience in politics, it is very risky to appoint him to such a high office. Also, his ties with lawless Russia and one of terrorism sponsors, Iran makes it more difficult for me to trust him to serve the country without fear or favor. However, if his business views do not align with his political views I think there should be no cause for alarm here. Also, he might help in convincing the president that climate change is real. Overall, I think he has a good chance of becoming secretary of state since he's quite popular with the republican led senate"
32350,2017-01-11T00:16:34Z,1,[85.0],[85.0],Because of Tillerson's business background and his status I think he is very likely to be confirmed as secretary of state. Even though his pro-Russia views may deter some people I think his businessman personality will win over many people.
32348,2017-01-10T23:43:47Z,1,[25.0],[25.0],i do not think this is likely to happen because people are cautious with his ties to Russia
32346,2017-01-10T22:35:41Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"I believe that he has a very small chance of winning but which the people we have today who vote, he might actually win. I don't think it is a good idea though"

However it also points out that while the last time a nomination had been rejected was in 1989, five picks have been withdrawn, including three of Obama's.
