Does a veto completely disqualify a candidate from running in the next rounds? Some press articles seem to suggest so (without being explicit). Or does a veto is valid just for one round, and the candidate can run again? The latter seems more likely, but does anyone know for sure?"

Probability: 20% - scenario 2: no agreement by Oct 1. In the first Oct poll, every candidate is vetoed or does not collect 9 approvals. Negotiations continue, Georgieva is nominated later and wins (15%) - Scenario 3: one of P5 is adamant against Georgieva, she does not get nominated, a man from the current candidates wins (60%) - Scenario 4: Georgieva is nominated after all, but does not win (5%)."
27461,2016-09-13T22:18:16Z,10,[30.0],[-30.0],"This is getting complicated. The Bulgarian government will support Bokova until the poll on Sep 26, and afterwards if she is first or second at that poll. If she is not (as it is very likely), they ""will see"". This looks like leaving the door open without committing one way or the other. But the important issue is whether Georgieva will agree to be nominated. My guess is that she will agree only if it's clear that she will be supported by the P5. So between now and October, the P5 will have to bargain on the distribution of top UN posts. If the Russians and the Chinese get what they want (various UN posts, or other stuff), then Georgieva will be nominated and will likely win. If not, she won't be nominated and the likely winner is a man. Hard to predict whether such an agreement can be reached. The Russians and the US are working together in Syria now, but this may unravel quickly. The West can also try to agree with China - where the relations are a tad less adversarial - and isolate Russia. But then Georgieva won't probably be nominated."

Suspect neither will happen, but still not an iron-clad plan to offer a new candidate. Would the UN like the narrative to be ""the original candidates were not the best qualified so we found a new person?"" My guess is no, but I also can't anticipate the final P5 moves."

So over the last while, we've seen SGs from South America, the Middle East, Africa, and E.Asia. There was also rumoured to be an expectation that the SG be from Eastern Europe this time around (at least on the part of the E. Europeans) but simultaneously, there appears to be an even stronger expectation (at least normatively) that the SG be a woman. Given that half of the serious candidates for the position are women, I think there's a good chance we might get a female SG this time around."

None of the men are from a country that is wealthy or powerful enough to exert undue influence. The ten temporary members of the Security Council are geographically and politically diverse and seemingly unlikely to form a bloc in favour of any particular candidate. Russia, and informal tradition favour an eastern European, but this can as easily be a woman as a man. All in all there seems to be no persuasive reason to suppose that a male candidate can succeed against the broad consensus that its time for a female secretary general. Even where particular female candidates are potentially weak, support will likely flow to one of the other women. The Bulgarian woman seems to be at least a little bit corrupt. Helen Clark, so far as I can find out, does not speak French, which could potentially lead to a French veto. (The French seriously considered vetoing Ban Ki Moon because of his limited French). The only thing I can envisage that undermines the near certainty of a woman winning the role is that there is no very strong female candidate. Im not sure of the intricacies of the voting system but conceivably say three women could get two votes each and one man could take the prize with three votes. I'll try to research that angle in the next day or two. Meanwhile my odds reflect the powerful consensus in favour of a woman secretary general."

It does seem that chances of an East European becoming Secretary General are high, given that it seems to be that region's ""turn"", and it is generally being reported that this will be the women's turn as well. As women make up 44% of the officially declared candidates (less if only Eastern Europeans are considered), a 50% increase over that starting point is probably as high as one should prudently go."
