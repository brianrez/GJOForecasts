In Serbia and Kosovo, there are heavily nationalistic ideals which exacerbates tensions. This is especially true in places where there are still Serb villages in Kosovo, and people in Kosovo who identify as Serbs. Instead of creating programs that help to assimilate these populations and grow acceptance, they are seeking to redraw country border lines. This discussion does not signify a move towards normalization, but rather a discussion that could lead to increased tensions. Russia also has very close economic ties with Serbia, as they supply their oil, as well as cultural and religious ones. This aspect of their relations could deter Serbia from reaching a normalization, especially given that both Serbia and Russia refuse to recognize Kosovo as a country."

The EU has also made the balkans a priority this year during the Bulgarian and Austrian presidencies, but this orientation may not outlive the Austrian presidency.

The EU has made it clear to both countries that normalization in relations is a crucial act if the two desires to enter the EU. Although this has been seen as a clear tool to persuade both parties, the situation is much more complex. Ethnic tensions are very high as Serbian officials and the general Serbian population refuse to acknowledge Kosovo as a sovereign nation. It’s been over 10 years since Kosovo declared independence and almost 20 years since the end of the War in Kosovo and there has been little success in normalization of the relationship between the two countries. Meetings that have thus far been planned have either been canceled or ended with little to no progress. The EU membership has been a good incentive for the two countries to begin working together, but current solutions that are being thrown around include a land swap, which has faced criticism from the international community as well as people in the region. If they continue with this solution at the rate they currently are, there is a very low chance that normalization will occur, however, if other solutions are proposed, and the two come to terms with the past, there is a chance for better success. Chances now are a bit better than they would have been 10 years ago, but still, the situation continues to slowly progress."

The West prefers good relations between the two countries and Russia prefers mild instability causing the prevention of EU accession for both countries. Keeping the two countries out of the EU is likely very important to Russia and contributing to poor relations is a good opportunity to prevent Western expansion. If your country uses the Cyrillic alphabet, Russia wants you off of the West's roster of member states of the EU or NATO. Prevention of accession only requires light to medium instability, whereas EU accession requires complete stability. Helping to maintain discord between two countries that already dislike each other requires much less investment from Russia with a higher likelihood of favorable results."

38548,2018-07-04T10:50:04Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"Despite the pressure on Serbia to come to a comprehensive agreement, there are several reasons why it's highly unlikely to happen before 2020: - Serbia is willing to trade Kosovo's recognition in exchange for the entry into the EU. This one, however, will not occur before 2025. To give its bargaining chip that early would expose Serbia to the risk of not becoming an EU member state in 2025 for different reasons independent of its own will (refugee crisis, EU crisis, enlargement fatigue, another exit, and so on) and despite an earlier Kosovo recognition - to recognize Kosovo at an acceptable cost, Serbia needs to obtain something from Pristina. This has not happened so far and in Pristina, they consider the case closed and see no reason why they should accept any compromise, which would oblige them to concessions - for Pristina, the absence of a comprehensive agreement is a long-term problem (it will complicate its path toward NATO and EU) but this path still has a long way to go before any accomplishment is made - the EU and the US have other problems to deal with than Balkans. This situation leads to a lack of interest and a diminished pressure on Belgrade and Pristina to find a compromise - Russia has long been absent from the Balkans and any NATO enlargement in the Balkans would not have the same impact in Moscow as in the case of Ukraine Georgia or Moldova. As a result, atlanticists cannot play that card to push for an agreement between Belgrade and Pristina - other ""frozen conflicts"" have not been resolved although they date from earlier times (Transniestria, Cyprus) - there's always a small risk of opening the Pandorra box in the Balkans with the unstable situation in Bosnia, obliging the US and EU to move carefully and not provoke a too strong counter-reaction (that could be used by Russia to pursue its interests in the Balkans), diminishing the rush to a negotiated agreement that is totally detrimental for Serbia."

Serbia doesn’t want to be part of any military alliance (but thank you Vlad for the Russian kit and all the support) . Serbia thanks Tsar Vlad the Shirtless for blocking UN resolution against Serbia for slaughtering unarmed Muslims . Doesn’t sound like normalisation to me. But perhaps some barrel bombs and attacking hospitals will work... https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/serbia-s-president-hails-russian-support-and-seeks-help-on-kosovo-1.3489401

Relations between Serbia and Kosovo are extremely tense and there has been little effort from officials on either side to fix the relationship between the two countries. While both countries are hoping to join the EU in the future, I don't see either side spearheading a normalization agreement anytime soon. Serbia is still phasing out institutions from the Kosovo war (http://emerging-europe.com/in-brief/serbia-kosovo-tensions-rise/), and until both sides feel like they have received reparations and reconciliation, there will be little progress in a normalization agreement. Additionally, the EU has set a path for possible accession of some Balkans nations in the year 2025, so while I see the probability of an agreement increasing with time, a normalization agreement by the end of 2019 is extremely unlikely. http://prishtinainsight.com/kosovo-serbia-normalization-agreement-key-benchmark-eu-accession/ timeframe"

Entrance into the EU could reboot the struggling Serbian economy and spark reform in a nation still badly broken by the ethnic wars of the 1990's. Reluctance on the part of Belgrade in part is due to its need ""to reform its slow and unwieldy judiciary, improve rule of law, tackle the freedoms of the media and safeguard minority rights"" as well as improve their relations with other Balkan states such as Bosnia and Croatia. The EU, still reeling from Brexit, may accept the beginnings of normalization as ""progress,"" in hopes to balance the loss of Britain."

As long as Belgrade wants EU membership, they will have to find some way around normalisation. The EU membership has value in a number of ways to Serbia, including economically (http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/kosovo-territory-swap-would-net-serbia-90-million-study-04-20-2018), and is relatively politically popular (https://www.euractiv.com/section/enlargement/news/most-serbs-support-eu-membership-cite-job-opportunities-in-new-poll/). Normalisation is obviously a big step for Pristina as well​ if they hope to get on the EU track. The low estimate comes from the timeframe. Serbia has only closed two chapters of the 35 acquis communautaire so far. Earliest accession date is 2025, and that's theoretical, so there seems to be no huge rush to finally solve the hardest thing immediately. There is a lot of room to continue making progress on an agreement without finalising one, which gives a lot of time to drip feed the ideas to the various stakeholders, which is probably preferable to a headlong political lunge. It's hard to see then how we get from where we are now to a signed agreement in about 20 months."
