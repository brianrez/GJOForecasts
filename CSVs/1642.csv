Current population is 184,422 (12/7/17), trending downward but is expected to increase. The 2018 estimate was formed using time series analysis (TS) and simple regression. 190,023 | Regression . Population regressed on year 196, 782 | Exponential TS 200, 482 | Average change over the period. 198,946 | Moving average using two previous years to forecast following year. INSIDE VIEW From the Wall Street Journal Article (6/8/17, Beth Reinhard) , Trump promises to step up prosecutions for drug offenses and illegal immigrants. Jeff Sessions, attorney general, has scuttled the Obama administration policy that avoids mandatory minimum penalties for non-violent offenders and has instructed federal prosecutors to charge for the ""most seriously readily provable offense"". Militating again this initiative are the need for prison reform and improved infrastructure (Money) . Fewer clemency grants are expected than Obama's 1,927 (most since Truman). The WSJ article estimates the population as 4,171 (2%) to 191,493. Estimates are shown above."

Will Inch be an ally for better prisoner education? Will he limit the amount of time prisoners are held in isolation? Will he rely on controversial for-profit prisons to house new inmates?Inch hasn’t said. Prisoner advocacy groups have asked Justice officials if any hearings will be held to examine Inch’s background and priorities. They were told no.*** Advocates for reform wonder if Inch’s empathy for soldiers with post traumatic stress disorder might also make him empathetic toward the plight of prisoners.Donson, citing a “leadership void” at the agency, said he hoped Inch would streamline the agency’s top-heavy administration and begin recommending more elderly or infirm prisoners be eligible for BOP’s “compassionate release” program, designed to free up prison space and reduce medical costs associated with caring for these prisoners.*** If Inch wants to address these shortfalls, he will have to be creative. The fiscal year 2018 budget includes the elimination of 14 percent of the Bureau of Prison’s staff — 6,100 jobs. https://www.themarshallproject.org/2017/08/23/can-a-general-conquer-the-federal-prison-system?ref=hp-1-111#.szaHH4UQN"

Almost all stupid policies come from the former, and the Attorney General has adopted one. However, it takes a while for changes in sentencing pratices to work their way into the prison system. First, some trials are already going on or are about to wrap up under arrangements made during the grownup period. These may not add as heavily to inmate population as later ones will. Also in this category are the ones which have ended but see a fairly long stretch of time between conviction and sentencing. Second, there are appeals, which take a while and mayn't add much to inmate populations if their subjects are out on bail or retained in state or local joints in the interim. Third, many district and appellate judges were Obama appointments and unless they are confronted with mandatory sentencing, may opt to keep people out of the slammer, and that's before you get to bench trials in which Obama judges may find a defendant Not Guilty rather than BoP fodder. Fourth, many states' jury pools consist mostly of adults who will acquit low-level offenders rather than send them off to the tender mercies of Jeff Sessions. So while this stupid policy will undoubtedly increase BoP populations over the medium term (at your expense and mine and to no other actual effect, by the way), the big BoP population explosion may not hit until second or third Q of '18."
