Making a quick analysis we throw out the high and the low to get 1764, 2694, 4483 Summed= 8941 then divide by 3 = 2980 which just says what a typical challenge should do after 1 year. However, is this case different? Yes. There are only 384 forecasters at this time. Best guess would be to make the 2980 an upper limit."
