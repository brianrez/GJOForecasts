I am not sure, short of this; any offficial announcement by the Ministere de Defense. Thank god Obama picked Ashton Carter for DOD.

498,2016-01-21T01:11:11Z,21,[83.0],[8.0],"+8 based on links & analyses of @Clairvoyance & @aaseawaf15. We have a two-step forecast: 1) Will the troops be deployed? and, if so 2) Will deployment be credibly reported? Because I believe the coalition is building to a major offensive campaign (which I also believe focuses the French upon Syria), and I believe the ""best practice"" is always to allow a period of reconnaissance, intelligence gathering, and acclimation, I have been leaning towards ""Yes"" as to the first part of the two-step process. [Edit: And for those who suggest that French SF may have already been there, I would suggest an increased tempo and scope as to their activities.] I could place some probability on the first step, but taking Le Drian's ""hint"" as a confirmation, and for computational simplicity, I'm just going to assume it to be ""yes."" The aforementioned is just a long way of saying we are faced with forecasting the probability that these (assumed to be) deployed troops will be reported upon. This is challenging because, except for very rare glimpses, it is a controlled information environment. - French ""long-standing policy of never discussing the deployment of its elite troops."" Certainly an excellent operational security policy and one that would likely be respected by the vast majority of Western news sources and outlets. + The assumption that LeDrian is sophisticated enough to recognize that even a ""hint"" is a violation of that policy, which therefore requires the additional assumption that LeDrian had some sufficient reason to violate that policy. Would the desire to generate a signal of coalition solidarity be sufficient reason? Is there some perceived need to demonstrate some active effort to a domestic audience? Perhaps this reason, whatever it may be, will continue. + There are some reputable non-Western sources and outlets who may have an independent interest in the report; which can only now be enhanced by, perhaps, the professional ambition of some intrepid journalist to pop the ""hint"" bubble that Le Drian has created. - The nature of the activities are covert, often in ""the dark"" both figuratively and literally. Not a lot of free-floating witnesses who don't have their back turned to the action as they are running away. Also, maybe the ""hint"" indicates the French SF are embedded within some U.S. SF group(s), making distinctive identification difficult. +/- The one perhaps relevant incident we have is that of a Canadian special force contingent. No news was generated by this contingent until they were placed under a crazy banzai-like attack (my description) by ISIL. If ISIL really is feeling the pressure, it is possible the frequency of such ""crazy"" attacks might increase, thus perhaps drawing attention to a French SF contingent."

The meeting came after a the arrival of an elite U.S. “expeditionary targeting force” in Iraq that is expected to include up to 200 Special Operations troops. It is not yet clear whether it has begun carrying out operations, but it is expected to conduct raids, collect intelligence and carry out other operations against Islamic State leaders.' Okay, FR is conducting air sorties, positioned the Charles de Gaulle offshore and has 3500 boots deployed in the AO, mainly as trainers. It has relied on US logistics and airlift capability for many of it's African missions and has experience coordinating with US and UK forces in Afghanistan.

Read any history of the Vietnam War and it will state that the first US combat troops were sent under LBJ, not Kennedy."
