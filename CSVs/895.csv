Current earnings season proves the point o Next rate meeting would be in the middle of next earnings season, it might well be that the US is then tentatively more open and feeling the worst is behind them. So outlook might be better. Yet, according to most recent IMF estimate the US economy will still be severely hit. • Lower rates: o Lower rates would imply one of two things:  A downward shift of upper and lower band. This would imply negative rates, which hurt European banks in recent years and even prompted hikes in Scandinavia, the US is very unlikely to follow the EU in this regard • A single rate (upper band = lower band): o The FED did historically have a single rate which at current effective funds rate levels would mean a lower upper band o As of today, I see no indications anyone is discussing this"
