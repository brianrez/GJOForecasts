Several of the remaining states are favorable to Sanders but the delegate difference is very large and the super delegates give Clinton a clear advantage unless Sanders finishes extremely strong. Sanders has a small chance based on the fact that so far he has out preformed expectations in several ways and the data has proven to be wrong with polling. If the polling continues to be off due to errors in collection his chances are better than they appear. I also believe there is a small but not 0% chance that the FBI investigation could come in to play and diminish Clinton's chances.

Key Note Speaker will be Elizabeth Warren. After HRC and Biden, EW is the next Dem nominee for 2020 ( if necessary) Goal: move HRC to DFA ( Dean WIng) position. Note Howard Dean did not hedge his bets. DFA grassroots picked Sanders long ago. That is a free vote pf members. Dean endorsed HRC. I did too after Super Tuesday. See www. realclearpolitics.com. Warren did not run unlike a Crux or Rubio she learns the Senate. Works well with all Dem Senators gather before the State of the Union every year. Watch Warren interact. Top 10 in power and recognized as future. Warren, tough, smart and has a bigger visons than just break up the big banks."

Historically, Hillary has been favored among Latino and minority voters while Bernie controls much of the young voter population. Though the primaries and caucuses have been back and forth as of lately, Hillary’s history and experience within the white house gives her the decisive edge. H Clinton’s recent performances have seemed to given her a huge boost in the democratic race going into the future. As of February 23rd, every major poll has Clinton up by at least ten points. In addition, about 6/10 primary voters view Hillary as the ideal candidate to represent the Democratic Party. A Due to the latest information on the race and with Hillary’s convincing victory, the latest prediction of 57% Hillary against 43% Bernie still holds. Bernie can easily slide towards the 50% range, but at the moment, Hillary is and continues to be in the drivers seat heading into March. M Recent polls continue to favor Hillary, and her 52.6% to 47.3% victory over Sanders in Nevada gave her much-needed delegates for the race to come. Hillary has won 502 delegates compared to Bernie’s 70, however, 2,383 are needed to win. But with a strong start and likely future momentum, it would be no surprise to see Hillary pull through with a victory. P The primaries are still an ongoing process, however logic will lead us to believe that Hillary will ride off of the much needed energy from her last two victories into the spring and certainly compete in the race against Sanders. S Large questions to answer: Can Hillary win over young voters, in addition to more males? Clinton has been seriously lagging within these demographics, and if she can find a way to resonate them, she will be a clear frontrunner for the nomination. Also, will she ever get over her shaky past as secretary? K The single most key player is Bernie Sanders, who seems as confident as ever to compete against Hillary in the future. The democratic candidate seems unfazed by the last two primaries, and believes he can be victorious in the primaries to come. N Delegates are won proportionally based on the vote counts in congressional areas, and 2,383 are needed to win, so Clinton will need some more decisive victories in order to haul in large quantities of delegates. South Carolina will be a key area for her to bolster her lead. O One thing that is important to note is that Bernie Sanders has been allotting most of his time to super Tuesday, which features 11 primaries and is arguably the most important part of the upcoming election. Will Bernie make a serious run at Hillary by winning massive amount of delegates in March? W Hillary needs to continue to ride out her momentum within her campaign, as she is beginning to rack up more and more support as we get deeper into the year. If Bernie wants to make a serious run, he needs to continue to attack Clinton’s credibility as secretary, her super PAC, her paid speeches, her views on the Iraq war, as well as her shaky past with regards to civil rights."

I get this impression particularly from African Americans (personal as well as media coverage). -- Polls also seem to agree with Hillary's popularity among southerners, Hispanics and African Americans, and I haven't seen any evidence that Bernie has penetrated that support base. -- Furthermore, superdelegates are a crucial factor in Hillary's favor and against Bernie. All superdelegates haven't expressed their support and these ppl can always flip, but this group strongly favors the establishment in the Dem primary process."

The numbers aren't there. As in, people aren't voting, numbers are WAY down compared to 2008. Some of that is due to the fact that the DNC seems to have utterly failed to properly train volunteers, and have made voting as difficult as possible. The caucus system in particular is just rife with stories of people leaving because of confusion, ridiculously long lines, and misinformation; volunteers doing illegal things (i.e. Iowa not recounting all the Hillary votes to see if anyone had left, Nevada letting people vote with registering, both caught on video), locations that were difficult to locate, and too few people on the ground with little to no training. This favors a particular candidate, whether it is intentional or not. And it most certainly favors Hillary in the primary (and, if I may say so, the Republicans in the general - I think if Hillary is nominated the DNC may find that they could lose everything due to independents and half of their voter base's apathy or outright loathing for Hillary). But Bernie's widespread support among younger voters isn't translating into getting them out to vote. And despite the ground that he is making up among minorities (Hispanic community in particular), it may not be enough quantity or fast enough. The African-American community in particular showed in Nevada that they are still serving as Clinton's firewall, overwhelmingly voting for her, almost as overwhelmingly as they voted for Obama in 2008. And unfortunately Super Tuesday is practically designed to destroy Bernie's momentum - overwhelmingly Hillary-loving states with large black populations. If he can't get out his support (and he has plenty, basically neck and neck with Hillary at this point), and right now the numbers show he simply isn't getting people to vote the same way Obama did, then he's probably doomed. I still think he has a decent chance, as literally every day that passes he moves a little up and she moves a little down in terms of the polls - but in the caucuses and primaries its simply not translating to the tangible numbers needed and the narrative is probably not going to be pretty after Super Tuesday, despite the fact that there will still be tons of voting to be done people may simply go back to assuming that the Clinton coronation that this race was always meant to be is moving forward as intended and not bother voting."

There are many factors that contribute to Hillary having a better chance at winning the nomination for president. First, Hillary has the backing of the democratic party's establishment, Wallstreet, many superpacs, news sources and almost any other source of wealth that is affiliated with the democrats. Additionally, Hillary Clinton has already locked up half the Democratic superdelegates in Nevada and South Carolina before the first votes are cast in either state. The former secretary of State has won public support from half of South Carolina’s six superdelegates and three of Nevada’s eight superdelegates. Bernie Sanders has secured only one, a Democratic national committeewoman from Nevada. The superdelegates are made up of Democratic lawmakers and party leaders who can cast a vote for the party’s nominee during the Democratic National Convention. They have the freedom to back whoever they want, and are not bound by the results in their states. Currently, according to recent polls, Hillary Clinton has a 61% to 34% chance of winning the South Carolina primary, mostly because she has a large amount of support from African Americans in this area. In Nevada, however, the two candidates are basically at a tie of 50% each. Moving forward, it is somewhat likely that Bernie Sanders will gain more support in Nevada because they were hit the hardest from the financial crisis of 2008 and Bernie Sanders campaign has been centered around breaking up the big banks. Some things that could change my prediction in the foreseeable future would be the results of the SC and NV elections. According to MSNBC, Bernie Sanders has employed over 240 staffers to work on his ground game, and about 80& of them are focusing on predominantly African American areas. If Bernie can effectively use his ground game to persuade blacks to vote for him, and somehow pull a upset victory in South Carolina, the chances of Hillary winning the national election will definitely drop. However, despite Bernie gaining momentum, it is still a long shot that he can pull an upset in South Carolina. Other factors that could play a role in Hillary winning the election are what happens if she is indicted for her email controversy, but it is unlikely that that will happen. Nationally, Hillary has a lead over Bernie of 49 to 33%. There are still a good amount of undecided democratic voters in the country, and how the next couple of debates and primary's turnout could have a major impact on each candidates chances of winning the democratic primary. However, in 2008, we expected Hillary to win SC but she lost in an upset to president Obama, so an upset by Bernie in this state is not out of the question, If it does occurr, his chances of winning the democratic nomination will dramatically increase. nevertheless, since Hillary has all the cards stacked in her favor, I predict that she has a 57% chance of winning while Bernie has a 43% chance of winning the democratic primary."

During the last campaign minority voters shifted towards Barack Obama once he began to be perceived as a viable candidate. While race likely played a factor in that campaign, there is a possibility that a similar outcome might occur - or a minimum that Hillary will see some erosion in her almost monolithic African-American support."

No, since complex systems can survive only a change by evolution, not revolution. In my understanding the US has lost the ability to a gradual progress, evolutionize as needed. Almost all subsystems, health, legal, education, media, political system, financial, military, residential housing, etc. - all of them are depending on subsidies from government, financed by the petrodollar scheme - means OPEC sells it's crude oil for US Dollar only, which creates an artificial demand for the US currency world wide. Here to two questions: Is this scheme going to last forever? If not, is the US system ready for the day when this scheme ends? So far, none of the candidates even distantly discusses this fact. Who ever is elected will learn first, that the empire will collapse immediately, if the petrodollar scheme will fall and will therefore continue with the same imperial policies as before seeding controlled chaos. The electorate is left in dark by consolidated and controlled media, and therefore by definition is not informed and therefore does not consent to the tensions the US-administration is creating world wide in an attempt to maintain a hopeless position - the world will not tolerate an US hegemony. Therefore, possibly Sanders would lay the most appropriate political direction to transform the US empire to a rather team player than a hegemony, but will he be able to overcome the financial oligarchs? I doubt it. More probable is, that the trunk will be cut off, and the elephant will die, similar destiny of the USSR."

For me this is an indication of selective observation bias. My rationale (right of wrong) would be: According to realclearpolitics.com Trump is in the lead for the Republicans (36,2%) with Ted Cruz following with (19,4%). So at this point it is not impossible that Trump will be nominated candidate for the Republicans in Cleveland July 18-21). Thinking/ hoping that this is impossible is a strong case of the 'Just world bias' And now my (weak) argument: Hillary Clinton is the only serious challenger for Donald Trump. My argument for this: According to Der Spiegel 5, 2016, page 23, Donald Trump's Roger Stone strongest attacks are against Hillary Clinton with quadruple ammunition: 1. Chelsey not being a child of Bill and 2. that Bill would have one son with a prostitute 3. maybe even more 4. the prostitute should have been black. My presumption is that you attack hardest on your biggest opponent. Therefor: HC 80%, 1% for O'Malley and Sanders 19% because a part of other predictors give him a change. Closely looking how this is going to develop: -""Iowa looks like nothing like the rest of America"" (Int.NYT, jan 30-31, page 9) so these results can be ignored. - My first update of my rational after Febr 9 (NH) and March 1st Super Thuesday."

Indeed, her greatest strengths (political pragmatism, strength of will, length of public service) can all be seen as weaknesses for an electorate who are keen for substantive, perhaps even systemic, change and upheaval of the political class. The strength of Obama's 2008 victory belies this electoral desire for fundamental reform, though Obama himself has not delivered on early promise. Sanders has crafted a strength of momentum which places him as the current favorite, however the crucial 'super' days where multiple large-college states vote will obviously be critical for him in winning outside states which resemble his (fairly liberal, fairly WASP-y) home state of Vermont. Results to date show that his record, radical policy positions and ability to communicate with a range of audiences is resonating well, however the acid test is whether this can translate to truly mass appeal, and whether his efforts to 'get out the vote' will be successful."
