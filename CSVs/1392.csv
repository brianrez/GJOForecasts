Additionally, the spread between 2 and 10 year treasury bonds are as close as they were in 2007 and 2002, precipitating a recession in both instances. Finally, the ECB and Chinese regulator authorities have chosen not to follow the Fed's most recent decision to raise rates, increasing the spread between US T-Bonds and others, sending investors and capital flocking back to US bond markets, which triggered massive price decreases in Italian and Argentinian government bonds. Should prevailing forces in the White House continue this path of ""US First, World Second,"" it's likely that we'll see further rate increases to better position the US bonds in capital markets compared to the Rest of the World."

Assuming the momentum will carry at least into the first half of Q2, a June hike is also a high probability. Beyond this things get a little more uncertain, but unless the economy slows down sharply in late spring/summer, a September hike seems likely as well. Now what are the main factors that would affect the economy by mid-year? The tax cuts provide some tailwind in the short run, while possible trade wars work the other way. However, provided most US allies are exempt from the recent steel and aluminum tariffs, their negative effect would be limited, I believe. And interest rates, while rising, are still low enough not to be a main drag on consumer and investment spending."

In the past (e.g. 2004/6) rates have risen in a six month period 4 or 5 times from a historically low rate. The current circumstances are unusual in that the US economy seems to be running close to capacity while government policies seem to be likely to increase demand (e.g. changes to taxes) and/or prices (e.g. increases in import duties). Import duties on steel and aluminum will likely feed straight thru to increased prices for goods made of steel and aluminum, as it would take some time for US producers to increase production to replace imports (they will probably not increase production much, and are very unlikely to invest in new plants). So an increase in prices would be good for steel and aluminum producers, but the increased prices would reduce demand for the end products (i.e. create inflation and slow the economy). If US tariff increases start a general trade war that would (obviously) be a risk to the US (and world) economy. We don't know if this will happen or not, but its clearly a risk. While this uncertainty lasts I would expect the FOMC to be cautious with rate changes. We know rate changes take about 18 months to effect an economy. The ""trade war"" could be all over in a week, but in the last couple of years we have seen several countries pursuing economic policies that most economists think ruinous so anything is possible. If I were setting rates, last month I might have thought 4 or 5 rate rises in the next year looked about right, the events of this month would have toned it down to 2 or 3 rises, So in six months maybe only 1 or 2, with the caveat that if the ""trade war"" fizzles out more rate rises can be done then."
