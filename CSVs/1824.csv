Kim-Jong might come across as an obese nutter, but he is more strategic than is acknowledged abroad."

For the time being, a change in leadership seems very unlikely. Different reasons are at play for this. Internal: North Korea might be the most controlled state on earth but this does not mean that there are not discontent citizens in NK who are not happy with the government. However, the government has been very successful in implementing a society where noone can trust anyone and whole families get punished because one member did something wrong. Hence, a revolt from within the country is very unlikely to topple the government. External: NK is perceived as a growing threat but neighbouring China still would not want it to collapse as it prefers NK to be a buffer and fears the influx of refugees from NK. South Korea talks about unification as a possible goal but also sees that the costs might be very high as NK and SK have developed very differently since their partition. The international community may not want NK to gain more power, more access to nuclear weapons but also fears what could come after a NK collapse. Despite NKs inevitable collapse over the long term (or at least a change in goverment style), Kim Jung-Un shows no sign of leaving the stage."

Based on Russian ballistic missile submarines, the Sinpo-class carry North Korea to the next level of submarine warfare. The challenge posed by SSBNs is their disruption of an adversary's confidence in detecting and destroying nuclear weapons before they can be used. While the U.S. tracks North Korean submarines, sometimes, as in 2010 when a North Korean submarine sank a South Korean corvette, they slip through the net. The Sinpo appears likely to provide a nuclear ballistic missile capability (SSBN) within 3 to 4 years, but it may be sooner. One final problem? Based on North Korea's recent and rapid improvements in its land-based ballistic missiles, the U.S. cannot take anything for granted. As we saw last week, North Korean ballistic missiles can likely already strike the outskirts of Chicago. Ultimately, this is just another wake-up call. The threat posed by North Korea is immense and it is growing. In turn, the Trump administration must prepare to strike North Korean ballistic missile development and combat forces. Absent that, it will never be able to get China to apply adequate pressure to Kim Jong Un."""

China’s nuclear safety agency also started monitoring radiation levels in its northeastern border areas on Sunday. “At present, the automatic radiation monitoring stations in the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning and Shandong are functioning properly,” Xinhua reported, citing the Ministry of Environmental Protection, which administers the safety agency. Addressing a business forum hours after the test, Xi did not refer directly to North Korea but he did say the BRICS bloc should be more proactive in mediating geopolitical disputes. He also underlined the importance of the United Nations. It was the third time Pyongyang had conducted a test just before a major diplomatic event for Beijing."""

E-International Relations, August 7, 'The US Response to North Korea: The Cyber Option': http://www.e-ir.info/2017/08/07/the-us-response-to-north-korea-the-cyber-option/ Clips from Relations article: ""There is, however, one thing the US can do to North Korea, despite the dangers this option poses. The US can block North Korea’s access to cyber-space, and make it clear that the US is behind the attacks. North Korea is fairly advanced in cyber space, and often uses the cyber realm to promote its interests. North Korea is suspected to have been behind numerous high profile attacks, including the Sony hack in 2014 and a recent string of attacks on banks. These attacks serve a range of purposes for the regime, including retaliation against those who have offended North Korea and to steal money. Much of the money from these bank hacks is suspected to have been funneled to the nuclear weapons program. North Korea has grown increasingly sophisticated and bold in its attacks; however, the kingdom’s cyber-capabilities still lag badly behind the US’. North Korea, for example, lost all access to the internet in the wake of the Sony hack as a result of a cyber-attack. There have been no unrefuted claims regarding who was behind the attack. It may have been the US government or hacker groups. Either way, the success the attackers had underscores the weaknesses in North Korea’s cyber-defenses. By contrast, the US is among the most capable actors. This proposal does carry dangers. Cyber-attacks raise the risk North Korea might escalate its offensive behaviors, and that China may become angered, particularly if the attack inadvertently spills into Chinese systems. These issues can be addressed. North Korea may not be prepared to worsen the situation. In fact, there is speculation North Korea “freed” Mr. Warmbier in hopes of opening a dialogue. The US must reassure allies it will stand behind them if North Korea escalates, and the US must be prepared to do so as failing to act will further strengthen North Korea. In regards to China, the US should discuss the goals of its operation with China and do as much as it can to ensure North Korea is the only entity meaningfully impacted. There is an additional risk. States have avoided claiming they have used cyber-space to punish another nation. Thus, by acting openly, the US runs the risk of setting a new norm of behavior that would allow other states to use cyber-space for similar reasons. This concern might be a bit overblown. This is a rare circumstance and is in regards to the world’s most infamous actor. Further, the US use of Stuxnet is well known and did not usher in a new age of cyber-warfare. Another targeted use in an extreme circumstance is unlikely to lead to a different outcome. The US could even use cyber-attacks on North Korea to help foster discussion regarding agreements on norms of behavior. Such an outcome would be greatly beneficial. To achieve this, the US must be very clear that it is using cyber-space in this specific case because: 1) a US citizen was murdered by a foreign regime through cruel and inhumane treatment, thus making the release of remaining US citizens highly pressing; 2) the development of ICBM represents a threat to the security of the US and its allies; 3) there are no other tools available to respond; and 4) the US wishes to avoid escalation in the physical realm, and 5) the US does not want to harm North Korea’s citizens. (Cyber-attacks should try to shut down offensive abilities and the connection to the outside world without affecting civil functions.) The US can stress that it is due to these factors that cyber-space is the correct venue for action, and that a broader use of cyber-attacks in other situations would not be acceptable. The US must stress also that it has two main, narrow intents. First, the US must use these actions in cyber-space as a deterrent. The US can harm North Korea economically by damaging North Korea’s ability to launch cyber-attacks on foreign targets. Second, the US should make clear it will only end the attacks once North Korea releases the three remaining US citizens it is holding and returns to fruitful negotiations regarding the nuclear program. There is an additional possible benefit should the use of cyber-tactics lead to the release of US citizens held prisoner and the resumption of negotiations. It will show that offensive actions in cyber-space can lead nations to change policies. It will, of course, only show this works in a limited arena. It is not possible for the US, Russia, China, Israel, or other major cyber-powers to change each other’s policies solely though cyber-actions. A successful outcome in regards to North Korea will instead show powerful nations that there is another way to achieve policy goals outside of sanctions and bloodshed. This is still a problematic outcome, of course, but far superior to the loss of life. There is an additional danger posed by using offensive cyber-weapons against North Korea. North Korea will be able to learn from the code used against it and advance their own capabilities. It appears, for example, that Iran advanced its offensive capabilities after it uncovered Stuxnet. The benefits in this case outweigh the risks, however. Further, once it is known what vulnerabilities the US used to launch its attacks, nations and private entities can create defenses against similar attacks."""

I'm not factoring in the possibility of such a strike's success, however, because a) it's a lot harder to actually do than to threaten, and b) even if U.S. and allied forces located him and attacked that location, he might survive anyway. I find it difficult to believe that Trump and his advisors would risk a strike when the probability of failure is so high. But they might; if they do launch such a strike, there will obviously be no warning, so there will probably be no data to analyze before forecasting.

North Korea's press is tightly controlled by the government, and media outlets are often used to convey official messages abroad. In the latest commentary by Pyongyang's Korean Central News Agency, titled ""U.S. Must Stop Modernization of Nuclear Strategic Assets,"" North Korea said Saturday it was interested in peace, but would not surrender its nuclear weapons as a condition for de-escalating the current tensions with the U.S. on the Korean peninsula. North Korea claims it views its nuclear arsenal as a means of preventing foreign invasion and routinely rejects arguments calling for its disarmament."""

As Fanell says, “Make no mistake: The target list for North Korea has been continuously updated during the past 50 years.” We may think Kim Jong Un should be worried by the presence of three carrier strike groups near his shores, but he may not be all that concerned. “Lots of firepower can deter only if the intended target feels genuinely threatened by it,” June Teufel Dreyer, a University of Miami political science professor and a leading Asia watcher, told me. “The U.S. has backed off enough times in the past that Kim probably doesn’t believe that we will use the firepower on him.” And as Arthur Waldron of the University of Pennsylvania has said many times, Washington has continually taught autocrats to disregard its warnings. Should Kim think Trump is bluffing with the Carl Vinson, the Ronald Reagan, and the Nimitz and he proceeds with his launches and detonations, the American president will find himself in an uncomfortable position. As Dreyer points out, “Bringing in three carrier groups and not using them sends a bad signal.” Kim may feel the three strike groups are irrelevant because he can, if the U.S. hits his nuke and missile sites, order the destruction of Seoul, a good part of the rest of South Korea, and Japan in retaliation. As Secretary of Defense James Mattis said a week ago at a Pentagon press briefing, “If this goes to a military solution, it’s going to be tragic on an unbelievable scale.” Yet a tragedy of that scale is possible. As retired Adm. Samuel Locklear, once head of U.S. Pacific Command, said in New York last week, “Just because it’s tragic doesn’t mean he won’t do it.” And the probability of America using force may just have gone up. South Korean President Moon Jae-in, elected on May 9, made statements during the campaign that sounded inconsistent with the U.S.-South Korea mutual defense treaty. Should Moon carry through on his threats and move his country closer to China and North Korea, Trump could conceivably decide that the lives of South Koreans are not his primary concern. In these circumstances, an attack on the North’s facilities becomes conceivable. Trump has often talked about America disarming Kim on its own should China not help, and there now looks to be a deadline for getting the job done. Acting Assistant Secretary of State Susan Thornton told reporters in Beijing on Friday that North Korea is a “time-limited problem set.” In common English, that means Trump wants a resolution “as soon as possible.” So what is the timeframe the president has in mind? Thornton says this is “not going to be a matter of years.”"

Therefore I predict his death will come as an accident, or due to illness. We will know if the plot fails if Un executes members of his inner circle prior to October."

The missile would have flown a distant of some 45oo kilometers if launched on a maximum trajectory. It appears to have not only demonstrated an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) that might enable them to reliably strike the US base at Guam, but more importantly, may represent a substantial advance to developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Given speculation over the past months about the possibility of military action by the Trump administration to prevent Pyongyang from acquiring such a weapons, the possible testing of ICBM subsystems in this low-key manner may be a North Korean hedge against the possibility of such action. We are still awaiting more details on this test, and if the North Koreans follow their usual practice we can expect photographs soon. But unless Pyongyang is hiding something completely new, there’s only one real candidate for this missile. During last month’s parade, one genuinely new missile was revealed – one that looks very much like a small, two-stage version of their three-stage KN-08 ICBM prototype, on displayed on a mobile launcher previously used for the “Musudan” intermediate-range ballistic missile. We don’t have a name for this missile yet; the “KN-17” designation has been used for both this system and for a Scud-derived short-range ballistic missile with a maneuvering reentry vehicle displayed in the same parade. But whatever the name, it would be expected to have about the same performance as the missile just launched."""

He supposedly spent many hours on detailed pencil drawings of his favorites."" ""I have not, of course, interviewed Kim. But my educated guess—informed by decades listening to a myriad of clients, including political leaders, gang leaders and organized crime figures—is that Kim was prevented from becoming a complete individual by being born into such a powerful, all-consuming family structure. And those whose lives are commandeered by the legacies of others and who, therefore, lose the opportunity to express their real emotions and core interests, do have some things in common. They are, first of all, filled with desperation and rage and may project it onto others, in irrational ways. The anger of a child, adolescent, teenager and young adult, whose real persona is “executed,” in favor of creating a clone of his dictator father, may know no bounds. That person, in adulthood, may execute thousands of others, as Kim has reportedly done, rather than reflect upon and truly register his own psychological annihilation. And that person’s rage could even become manifest as an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, coupled with raw hostility toward other nations. It may seem astounding to think that one human being, suffocated psychologically, could threaten the entire world with his internal fury bent 180 degrees and then released from the cauldron of his psyche, but that is Hitler’s story, too. Is Kim Jong Un all bluster? Is the North Korean quest for nuclear arms and the means to deliver them to North America just a ploy to gain more leverage in foreign affairs? I wouldn’t bet on that. The rage of a boy who may have dreamed of being a basketball player, or an artist, and became the living embodiment of his father, against his will, could project that death upon millions."""

Alcohol from other countries landing in North Korea is on the rise, but it appears Kim is hitting harder stuff than before with 10 times more rum arriving in 2016 compared to 2015. Official statistics revealed he spent £139,000 on vodka last year, up $32,000 on 2015. Half of the money he spends on booze is blown on regular wine, but the growth in his spirit imports suggest he is changing his ways. Last year, the leader claimed to have downed 10 bottles of Bordeaux during one meal last year, but the figures show he has not imported a drop of French wine in four years."""

It is an autonomous agency of the North Korean government reporting directly to the Supreme Leader. It was established in 1973. In addition to its internal security duties, it is involved in the operation of North Korea's concentration camps and various other hidden activities.

North Korean succession is hierarchical, but it depends on: (1) acceptance and support by the military; (2) elimination of opposition; (3) charisma and respect of the leader (4) support of the elites. As to acceptance and support of the military, the nuclear program seems to be consistent with the military ambitions. North Korean engineers and population seem to be educated and ingenious enough to carry the program on. As to elimination of opposition, there are no signs that the Supreme Leader is having trouble with it. As to his charisma and respect, Kim-Jon un does NOT have a son. His father has reportedly died of high blood pressure and diabetes. He maintains a very unhealthy lifestyle. An unnamed official responsible for providing supplies for his health has defected with his family in late September. His health might be undermining his personal power. His mental health might be making his actions towards his physical health even more endangering. His wife Ri Sol-Ju has disappeared for 7 months. Speculations are that she might have given birth, have been killed or be recuperating from some illness. Unless he has a son, he has nothing to look forward to except perpetuating his own personal power. BUT, his supporters might become nervous with the perspective of this illness. As to support of the elites, sanctions imposed to North Korea have been difficult to implement. Coal - North Korea major export product - prices have risen and boosted its economic cushion making it even more difficult for the sanctions to make an impact. B. The international community has so far approached North Korea policies with sanctions. Sanctions have limited effect. Even if they had full effect, their inconvenience might drive an unstable leader with nothing to lose to simply launch a nuclear attack. This would defeat the purpose of the sanctions. There are other countries that take advantage of the situation in North Korea. Park Geun-hye - South Korean president - has proposed extend its mandate term to better deal with sensitive situations, such as the relationship with North Korea. China is the primary trade partner of North Korea and it views it as a buffer against the Democratic South in its northeastern border. HOWEVER, the nuclear tests have strained this relationship prompting China to support UN Security Council Resolution 1718. ""Bonnie Glaser of the Center for Strategic and International Studies says the Chinese government has tried to persuade North Korean leaders to revoke the clause that would force Beijing to come to Pyongyang’s defense. Beijing has also said if conflict is initiated by Pyongyang it would not abide by its treaty obligation"" http://www.cfr.org/china/china-north-korea-relationship/p11097. International contact has not been completely cut off. Leaders have continuously kept contact, even if deemed symbolic (i.e. the Film Festival in Pyongyang) C. Whoever wins the US election will have to deal with China and North Korea, maybe as a bundle. Being lenient with an ever-growing nuclear power is bad strategy. But options are scarce and violent. But this will not happen in the short term"

Either a faction within the North Korean military will kill Kim Jong-un to prevent the destruction of the DPRK in a war, or the Republic of Korea will execute a pre-emptive strike to short-circuit impending hostilities. It's hard to predict when this will happen, but I don't see it happening in much under a year. Ironically, further failures of the DPRK's missile development program will make hostilities more likely. Since Kim thinks that he must have a nuclear ICBM capability to guarantee survival of his regime, his inability to mate a nuclear weapon to a functioning long-range missile might drive him to take greater risks and perhaps try to run a bluff-based ultimatum against South Korea and the United States."
