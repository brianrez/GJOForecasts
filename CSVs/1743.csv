Will India or Pakistan launch a ground offensive in Kashmir before 1 June 2017?,2017-02-21T18:00:50Z,2017-05-31T17:00:28Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Foreign Policy'],598,654,246,237,"Unrest in Kashmir is the source of constant tension between India and Pakistan (International Business Times, The Hindu). Examples of ground offensives include India's Operation Vijay in the 1999 Kargil War (GlobalSecurity.org) and Turkey's Euphrates Shield in Syria (The Independent). Examples of military incidents that would not meet the threshold of a ground offensive include the September 2016 attacks (The Guardian, CNN), the October 2014 border clashes (BBC), and the 2001 attack on the Indian Kashmiri Assembly (BBC).

If India or Pakistan launched a full scale ground offensive to claim Kashmir, the casualties of the citizens of the attacking country would be unacceptable. The terrain alone of this region of the world is unthinkably difficult to move through without any thought of combat. In my opinion, whichever country decides to lead a ground offensive in the Kashmir region would lose terribly and I believe both Pakistan and India are aware of this. Claiming Kashmir via a ground offensive would be equivalent to occupying the tribal lands between Afghanistan and Pakistan via a ground offensive."

The state’s leader, Mehbooba Mufti, flew to New Delhi this week to urge Prime Minister Narendra Modi to hold talks with separatists. A new female police battalion has been established to deal with the schoolgirls and other public safety issues. Mufti’s government also instituted a month-long ban on social networking sites WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and others Wednesday to slow the spread of incendiary viral videos among young people — including one in which the army strapped a man to the hood of a jeep as a human shield. “I can’t say how difficult it will be but we’re very confident it will be contained,” said S.N. Shrivastava, the special director general of the Jammu and Kashmir Zone of the Central Reserve Police Force. Yet some see the presence of the young girls in protests as a sign that the security situation in the valley is spiraling out of control. Former chief minister Omar Abdullah tweeted this week that student protesters are the “new worry” and posted a photo of a girl in her school uniform kicking the side of a police vehicle. She clutched a brick in one hand, with a basketball tucked under her arm."""

The article has come in the backdrop of the BJP's unprecedented victory in just concluded assembly elections that were believed to be a referendum on the Prime Minister's economic policies undertaken in his first half. ""If Modi wins the next election, India's current firm and tough manner is bound to continue. It will be without question good news for the country's own development. Nevertheless, it will likely mean more difficulties in making compromises in rows with other countries,"" the article said."

Some sort of ground offensive is always being conducted if you count the operations taken up by Indian military forces against the terrorists and their local sympathisers, but that is unlikely to resolve this question as per my understanding. It is clear from the question's details that it will require a major cross border attack larger in scope than the 'surgical strikes' done in Sep 2016. I think that is highly unlikely to come about, although there is certainly a good chance for bigger anti-terrorist operations in the time period of this question.
