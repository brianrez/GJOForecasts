[...] As part of the initiative, individual governments of Latin America sign Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with the DFC, laying out areas of focus for which types of projects will be included in the funding. The Governments of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador have each signed on for $1 billion each in US government funding for infrastructure projects as part of América Crece.

Even though two countries severed ties last year, there has been no indication that any other countries are planning to sever ties with her re-election in January 2020. The Chinese do have ""race to zero"" campaign to sever all diplomatic ties with Taiwan so more countries will switch to the PRC over time as they apply additional pressure. Although the current 15 countries that have diplomatic ties with Taiwan provide trade, international support, and legitimacy benefits, countries like the US, UK, and Japan (informally aligned with Taiwan) provide greater benefit and voice to Taiwan than the other smaller 15 countries still in the fight. I am assuming that the countries still maintaining diplomatic ties with Taiwan are also smaller countries, that want to maintain a voice in the international community and this provides that avenue, and worth keeping. Worth keeping a closer eye on other countries in East Asia and the Pacifica and potential inducement measures going on there from China's ""race to zero"" to see if another country will fall in the next few months."

Given the steady success of the PRC's inducements to drop recognition of the ROC, it is possible another country will do so before November 30, 2020. However, the Trump administration has stepped up public displays of support for the ROC with widely publicized cabinet and sub-cabinet level visits to Taiwan in summer 2020. HHS secretary Azar was the highest level official USG visitor to Taiwan since 1979. This very public support may reduce the chances of defection in the short-term. Likewise, the PRC's apparent suppression of reporting about COVID-19 in the early days of the pandemic may have reduced its appeal, but that is difficult to quantify.

So if Taiwan is shedding allies at a rate of nearly one country per year, they are due to lose another friend in 2020 if they have not already done so. So next step would be to figure out whether Taiwan has already lost an ally in 2020. So far I have not found info indicating that a country renounced diplomatic ties in 2020, yet, so that would mean that Taiwan is due to lose another country this year.

Perhaps a country will accept an offer of covid immunization in return for recognition of the PRC. This would be a shrewd tradeoff for a national politician to engineer. Paraguay is wedged between two covid hot spots: Brazil and Argentina, it would appear that this would be a logical tradeoff to protect the population that may otherwise have a difficult time getting jabs. Given that the PRC has several vaccines both in trials and distribution this would seem to be a logical carrot and humane gesture."

The Holy See is making a deal with China but its support of Taiwan will not be affected. China might try to buy off some others as covid has destroyed economies.

Belize, Hondurus, Nauru and Taualu have all reaffirmed their relations with Taiwan recently and official visits to Taipei by the US and Czech Republic increase their international stature for support. If another country is to cease official recognition, it will likely be after November to assess the US stance towards Taiwan following the elections."

However it is probably not greater than a 30-50% chance since the timeframe is very short. iii) US foreign policies in response may be discouraging Taiwan's allies from switching sides. For instance it's notable that after Pence cancelled a visit with the solomon islands when they recognised the PRC, the only nation to cease recognising Taiwan was Kiribati four days later (probably because it was already their plan). However it is unclear. The article below argues in some cases the policies may actually encourage nations ceasing recognition with Taiwan (though I'm not completely convinced). Nevertheless China probably will continue poaching most allies if they have enough determination given everyone's interests. iv) With all that said this research is very scant so it's possible I don't know what I'm talking about."
