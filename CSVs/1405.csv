Get Out makes a solid Oscar push with younger voters, but many older (and white) academy members don't put it at the top of their ballot — if they've even seen the film at all. Even if it's not everyone's #1 movie, The Shape of Water is the least polarizing, allowing it to take advantage of the weighted voting system (i.e. being ranked as a voter's #2 film still benefits it overall). Guillermo is a storied and beloved industry vet who made a movie that audience, critics, and (most importantly) voters loved. He takes home gold for Best Director and Best Picture on Sunday."

The films that most consistently show up in expert opinions on Best Picture winner are The Shape of Water, Three Billboards and Get Out. All of them note how unsure they are and also note these points of concern: First, The Shape of Water wasn't nominated for Best Ensemble at the Screen Actor's Guild Awards - the last film to win Best Picture with the same circumstance was Braveheart in 1995. While Three Billboards has performed well at lead-up awards like BAFTA, pundits claim that the film may not perform as well in the Academy's preferential voting system, which tend to favor movies that all voters liked vice a film some voters adored and others hated. Get Out seems to embody the intangible argument amongst experts - the film was widely loved and topical, though it doesn't have the same pedigree as a more ""traditional"" Best Picture choice like the other two - though even this has holes in it given Shape being a fantasy film."

My projections were instead based on a mix of the projections of professional critics, my estimations of how political pressures might impact academy voters, and the types of films that have won in recent history. As cynical as it may sound, I think the Academy is anxious to reduce some of the pressure of the #oscars-so-white twitter campaign from the previous two years and that pressure will give voters more incentive to vote for Get Out than they might have otherwise had. This is unfortunate as I believe the was excellent and would be absolutely deserving in the absence of any racial consideration. It also may mare the perception of it selection if were to win best picture as cynics will say it won as some form of racial appeasement. I think Three Billboads Outside Ebbing, Missouri best fits the mold of recent best picture selections, however I think Get Out was a far more unique form of story telling with equal depth and relevance and was flawlessly executed. I gave significant consideration to The Post and the Shape of Water as well. The Post is possibly the most in line with what a traditional Best Picture selection might look it and it of course has Meryl Streep who the most prolific oscar magnet in history. The Shape of Water could be a surprise and my be the most unique prospect but the credit I give it as prospect comes entirely from professional critics as i know very little about it and as a result may have undervalued its chances."

However, 1) the Academy tends to vote for dramas with less comedy in them, and 2) ""The Shape of Water"" has lots of buzz and is ranked as the likely winner in multiple polls. So I give it a better than even chance of winning. Both of these films feature female leads, and with the Time's Up movement dominating Hollywood in recent months, it's likely that voters will consider this to be an appropriate year for a movie with a central female character to win Best Picture. For this reason, following the top two films listed above, I give ""The Post"" and ""Lady Bird"" a 5% chance each. For its popularity and unusualness, I give ""Get Out"" a 3% chance, and the rest 1% each.

Was this monster/creature a metaphor for anything?

So I mentally crossed off Shape of Water even though it's enormously popular. The Post ""should"" be as popular as Spolight, but it just wasn't that moving. It may still get academy attention. I downgraded a movie that I thought I'd say 100% historically significant allstar cast gimme. Get Out and Three Billboards have great, great potential based on storyline and actors. Dunkirk has to be considered for historical significance. Lady Bird? I want to say it's great but I found the story so common and privileged that it bothered me.

Often they want to promote a social issue, like LGBT rights, black lives, women and violence. So they may pick Phantom Thread because Day Lewis is retiring and possibly ill and it is unique and a bit strange. They may pick The Post because they constantly overlook Streep's brilliance and Hanks' and it is past time to rectify that and it IS about The Issue of Today in politics. They may pick Ebbing because they love the cast and it is brilliantly played by that cast. They may pick Shape of Water because it is unique and strange and has a mute feminist .

The shape of water, from an inside perspective, is a brilliant film by Guillermo del Toro, which speaks greatly to some of the judgmental attitudes of our time. It is likely to strike a chord among the more political voters in the Academy for several strong reasons. The data I wish I had access to, however, is how much money has been spent on Oscar campaigns per film this year.
