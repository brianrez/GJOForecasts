The margin of victories in 2014 and 2016 for Republican candidates were shockingly large in comparison to many other purple states in 2014/2016. Stagnant demography, mediocre but not terrible job prospects, and exporting of college educated youth to trendy coastal or sunbelt cities makes the education gap less important.
