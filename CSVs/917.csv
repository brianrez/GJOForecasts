This is largely due to the fact that interest rates on the 10-yr reflect future expectations for inflation. If growth and inflation are expected to slow (a recession), then the 10-yr falls. Meanwhile, if the Fed is still hiking rates, the 2-yr rises and the curve inverts. Structural factors keeping inflation low have prevented this from occurring."
