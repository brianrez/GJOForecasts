Regardless of who wins the elections, fiscal stimulus is very likely to come before or after the election. The current proposed fiscal stimulus is 1.8 - 2.2 trillion. This is likely to be funded via government bond issuance. some of this will be absorbed via primary dealer banks, the majority will be absorbed onto the fed balance sheet. The counter argument is the that there is stalemate in the run up to the elections, and stimulus does not come, however this is against both the interest of the republicans and the white house as a booming stock market is going to be more favourable for the incumbent. The democrats will want to delay, but as soon as the numbers 1.8 - 2.2 converge closer the stimulus package should be signed. Assuming the Fed takes on 50% of 2 trillion in bonds, this makes the balance sheet 8.1 trillion."

The most likely scenario going forward is underwhelming demand for Fed credit lines as banks have been flooded with deposits. (https://app.ft.com/content/73177be1-71cf-4e31-9590-a296a2ba16c7) Alternatively, we will see a sharp break in volatility suppression and a second leg down similar to what happened from Feb 20th to Mar 20th. In that case, more than 1.5tn should be necessary to avoid total meltdown, as the market structure problems have become worse and not better compared to half a year ago (i.e. excessive leverage as a response to insufficient yields, increase in Junk and Spacs uptake etc.). This question merits a lot more discussion, but I will leave it at this and add more later as the period is fairly long term given the fickle nature of financial markets."

I also believe many states will wait as long as possible to reimplement lockdowns due to the mass opposition from citizens and businesses. Therefore, I believe the situation will be worse than during the first wave even though I believe the rate of spread will be less due to some social distancing and preventative measures currently in place. The case counts will be higher, along with hospitalizations and deaths. And, everyone will realize that the restrictions were lifted too early which implies the next round of lockdowns will be in place longer. Now, the existing government aid is ending soon, and there is talk of additional support. This existing government aid lasted for ~3-4 months. Any additional support would likely need to be enough to cover a minimum of the same time period, but likely longer due to the above. It also may need to be substantially more because many individuals and businesses can survive a short lockdown without income or revenue on existing savings and minimal stimulus. But an additional lockdown just after the first one when it’s expected to last longer, will be a bigger strain and therefore require more government help. Now, assuming the existing assets on the balance sheet aren’t written down significantly because they’re “essentially” backed by the FED, this implies substantially more will be required from the government. I believe the situation described above highlights that the existing $3 trillion increase would be needed again (at a minimum) if the situation was the same as the first. But considering I believe it will be substantially worse and longer in duration, I believe the stimulus will need to be substantially higher. So, I believe the number will be above $11 trillion."

If we apply the same growth to the value of total assets before the COVID crisis, we end up at around 10 trillion. Let's assume the Fed's interventions will be slightly more aggressive this time. So we'll give the highest odds to the top three categories."

Japan, China, and the EU have their own problems and can't possibly absorb that much debt. The FED will be purchasing the lion's share of it. The balance sheet is right now somewhere around seven trillion. They have purchased almost 3 trillion dollars worth of treasuries in the last 3 months. The Treasury is borrowing $3.7 trillion in the period from April to September, and most of that is still ahead of us. Congress is currently working on another bailout bill which is currently set to cost another 3 trillion dollars. it is very likely we will see other bailout packages as well. also consider there is a lot of pressure right now for the FED to do negative interest rates but Jerome Powell seems to be resistant to it and has stated that he would support more asset purchases before setting interest rates negative. Jerome Powell just admitted that there is no limit to the amount of money they are willing to create. Looking at past recessions is not relevant to what is happening now. The wheels are coming off the bus. All the Fed has to do is continue buying treasuries at the rate they have been for the last three months to hit $11 trillion, and with the debt issuance coming from the Treasury, the rate of purchases will actually be more than that."
