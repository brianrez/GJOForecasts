But, I'm going to add an extra assumption that the undecided voters do not break that way, but rather break more toward the minor parties. Who knows!?! lol So close. Exciting. (Now here's the rub.

While it has maintained an average lead of 34.9% over three months against POS, there are several factors which could leave both parties with a marginal loss or gain: migration in to EU and increased anti-immigrant sentiment among the polish electorate. PO holds a consistently Center Right position while PIS maintains a variance in the spectrum from Center Right to Center Left.

The PO outlook is pro European, based on European defense strategies, which currently non greatly in favor of militarizing Poland against Russia. Duda and the PiS seem more inclined to invite NATO and US troops into Poland and to create defense arraingements with other countries bordering on Russia. The PiS is less interested in EU initiatives like renewable energy, when Poland has large amounts of coal, or social issues, than the PO position offers. Parties are required to collect 5%, and coalitions 8%, of the vote to gain Parliamentary seats. The united Left coalition of ""Your Movement"" and ""Democratic Left Alliance"" parties have combined, but the wiki polls show their combined vote total at apprx. 4% to 12%.
