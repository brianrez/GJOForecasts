They are now increasingly at odds amid mostly hidden jockeying to influence a protracted and possibly unruly succession struggle. With the arrest of Mr. Muzraev, however, the infighting burst into the open. ...Last month, however, the official, Mikhail K. Muzraev, was forced from his car at gunpoint near his home in the city now called Volgograd by a team of heavily armed men sent from Moscow by Russia’s Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., the main successor agency to the K.G.B. He was flown to Moscow and jailed the same day. ...On Thursday, in another sign of turmoil in Volgograd’s justice system, a female judge on the municipal court was found dead outside her apartment building in the center of the city. She was reported to have “fallen” from the window of her apartment on the 15th floor. ...Nikolai Petrov, a political scientist, said the abrupt fall from grace at the hands of the F.S.B. of such a powerful law-enforcement figure as Mr. Muzraev was a clear sign that a divide-and-rule balance between different clans of “siloviki” — whose loyalty to the Kremlin and wariness of each other have been the bedrock of Mr. Putin’s rule — is wobbling. “Without a clear signal from Putin about what he will do in 2024 or who will replace him, the whole system is coming apart,,” Mr. Petrov said. “Putin is in control of all major moves, but we see more and more moves by this or that elite clan.” ...Mr. Putin could well attempt another ruse to stay on after 2024 but anxiety about his intentions has left rival power centers scrambling to assert their influence ahead of a possible transfer of power at the top, political analysts say. ...Mr. Kurilla added that it was not yet clear who would win the fight over Mr. Muzraev and his record in Volgograd, but it was already clear that it involved far more than a mere provincial quarrel. “Something is going on in Moscow,” he said. https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/13/world/europe/fsb-intelligence-committee-putin-russia-muzraev.html"

However, as it stands, the scenario ends in January 2020, and it is highly unlikely the constitution will be changed prior to that date. There is simply no urgency for the Kremlin or Putin to pursue a change when there are nearly six years before the next election is held. Putin is still relatively young, especially compared to President Trump and the current candidates for the U.S. Democratic Party, several of whom are in their early 70s. That said, it is fairly likely the Kremlin and Putin will pursue a change to allow him to run again, but not prior to January 2020."
72994,2019-06-24T17:59:19Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"I think it unlikely that the Russian Constitution will be changed before 1 January 2020 to allow Putin to run for a third consecutive term. Mostly because I do not think Putin will make that move. In the past, he was perfectly willing to step into another political leadership role to abide by the constitutional rules. While, he may not have fully approved of the new President's every actions, he was close enough and maintained enough political power and clout to still effectively lead Russia in the direction he deemed most appropriate. This evidence, plus Putin's increasing age and the likely desire to ""end on a high note"" and retire safely and securely are probably enough to keep him from pressing for a constitutional change. He still has a few year to groom a successor of his choosing to ensure his legacy does not die. The 10% yes is attributed mostly to the random crazy acts of life that happen in this world. If the international political climate were to shift dramatically in the next six months, and he became anxious for the future of his homeland, I could see the Russian people and Putin pressing for the change to ensure continued stability instead of risking an unknown with a new president."
73176,2019-06-24T15:44:25Z,1,[50.0],[50.0],"I think it is likely that the Constitution could be changed by 1 January 2020 to allow Putin to stay in power longer. Currently, the next Russian elections are set to be held in 2024 at which point Putin will have fulfilled the two consecutive term limit. However, in the past Putin has found ways around this rule. In 2008, the Constitution was changed to allow for longer terms, changing from a 4 year limit to a 6 year limit. This change allowed Putin to remain in his position an extra 4 years than he otherwise would have. He has also hand picked others to serve as president while he served elsewhere in government in order to break up his time in service and not have to extend his term limits in the past. There has already been discussions within the Russian government of amending the constitution to allow Putin to serve longer. At this time Putin claims he is not looking to serve another term but he has made similar claims in the past and still chose to run for another term. Therefore, I think it is likely the Constitution will be amended to allow Putin another term or to extend his current term. However, it is also likely that he may find other ways to skirt the term limit. Additionally, it is likely that the Constitution might be amended to allow for this prior to 1 January 2020 but I don't think it is highly likely since there will still be four more years left of his term in which that change can be made."
73149,2019-06-24T01:02:26Z,2,[40.0],[-5.0],"Putin's approval rating generally averages around 65%. Although Putin hit a historic low of 33.4%, this is still higher than American approval ratings of Congress (see: https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/05/25/putins-trust-rating-hits-historic-low-state-poll-a65744). Putin is generally liked by his people. In the last election, Putin won significantly and the term limit increased for him. However, I did not want to fully commit to a response over 50% because Putin's trust level has also declined more recently, especially as Russia's economy continues to decline. Other experts indicate there are signs that a political stir-up may occur, as some have expressed a likelihood of placing Putin in a position that enables him input for crisis situations. Since Putin has been there for two decades, Russia will most likely face a lot of questions in regard to its future, stability, and public concern. Generating a new position may be the best fit to ease apprehnsion. See: https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2019/0122/New-Russian-order-After-presidency-yet-another-role-for-Putin."

This has led him to imprison political prisoners, jail dissidents/free media, intervene in the Ukraine/Syria, and meddle in Western elections. This behavior suggests that Putin would have no problem with any political movement to keep him in power past 2024. The reason my probability percentage is so low right now is because I think Putin and his allies would want to pursue this course of action closer to the end of his current term in 2023-2024."
73046,2019-06-18T17:03:57Z,3,[6.0],[-1.0],"Putin has served as Russia's preeminent leader since 1999, and his popularity remains high. The constitution can be modified using simple legislation, but, at least officially, amending the section of the constitution that would allow Putin to remain in office beyond 2024 requires a constitutional convention- or a repeat of the ‘castling’ maneuver that enabled him to remain in power as prime minister during the nominal presidency of his acolyte Dmitry Medvedev between 2008 and 2012 https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/going-legit-foreign-policy-vladimir-putin. (The constitution was changed only once before -- in 2008 -- when Dmitry Medvedev, just months after succeeding Putin as president, pushed through an amendment that extended the presidential term limits from four to six years). https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-s-top-judge-spurs-new-talk-of-changing-constitution/29547265.html. In May 2018, lawmakers in Chechnya submitted a proposal that would allow Russian President Vladimir Putin to run for office in 2024, giving him another six years at Russia's helm. Some think it is inevitable that he will want to stay in power, if for no other reason than self-protection- as he has made a considerable amount of enemies https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/18/612450404/lawmakers-propose-to-extend-putins-term-limits-as-president. Political analysts and government insiders have been discussing the possibility of constitutional changes for months as the focus on the end of Putin’s term grows. Putin, now 66 years old and apparently healthy, has suggested he doesn’t plan to stay beyond that time, but few see a suitable replacement for the man who has ruled Russia virtually unchallenged for the last 18 years https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2018/12/26/russia-contemplates-constitution-changes-as-putin-faces-term-limits-a63970. Russia’s great power identity is an enduring legacy of its imperial past. Ideas and ideology will continue to influence Putin’s foreign policy over the current presidential term. Putin arguably remains the dominant political figure in Russia. Nobody’s certain Putin could pull off a transfer of power without triggering destabilizing infighting among rival Kremlin camps that currently is held in check by his rule. The political and personal risks to Putin are high https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-21/kremlin-wonders-if-putin-may-follow-kazakh-model-to-keep-power. Putin, 66, won a fourth and presumably final term with a record 77 percent in elections last year. He’s crushed political opposition and centralized power in his own hands since he was first elected in 2000, becoming so dominant that many Russians find it hard to name potential successors even as his popularity has declined https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-21/kremlin-wonders-if-putin-may-follow-kazakh-model-to-keep-power. All said, in early 2019, Russia's trust in its President Vladimir Putin has fallen to its lowest level since 2006, falling more than 33 percent, according to a recent poll conducted by the Russian-state Public Opinion Research Center. Confidence in Putin’s government fell 33.4 percent amid sluggish economic growth, a decline in disposable income, and a deeply unpopular rise in the retirement age. The trust level was at 71 percent in July 2015 after Russia's annexed Ukraine’s Crimea https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/poll-shows-russia-trust-putin-falls-time-190122184309853.html. When Putin came to power in the midst of economic turmoil in 1998, he promised Russians better living conditions and decent salaries, in exchange for the freedom of expression - the social contract. For this reason, the inability to deliver might very well overshadow political culture. Any constitutional change before 01 January 2020 would send this public perception deeper into the negative. For now- it is likely Putin will appear to depart as scheduled while considering ways to influence the Kremlin into the future to bolster his legacy."

However, the reality of this announcement is that there are hidden motives that could be present underneath. For example, maybe Vladimir Putin and his team are just putting out feelers for how the public will react to the suggested future leaders. Depending on how the public reacts and how Putin decides to address it will greatly change the way this prediction plays out. Additionally, his character as a leader can be an indication of what we should expect in the next year. Sure, he is impulsive and unreliable, but his grasp on his cabinet and the people who surround him is an entirely meticulous and well thought-through product of his eagerness to maintain control. Therefore, looking ahead at the election past 2024, some ideas and plans may be in the works that we don't know about.

Such events could be an internal hardship (obviously caused by outside enemies), war, natural disaster with severe death toll and destruction, civil unrest.
