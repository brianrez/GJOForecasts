The DoJ is seeking to abrogate those treaties and compel that such information be provided despite it being against Irish law for Microsoft to comply. Should SCOTUS side with the government, it would force a number of actions to follow that would be damaging to the US tech sector and could force American tech companies to move their headquarters outside of the US in order to comply with EU and Irish laws regarding data privacy/protection.
