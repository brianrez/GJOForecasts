While Cameroon has one of the best economies on the African continent, falling oil prices, a world wide recession resulting in reduced demand for Cameroon's natural resources, and the COVID19 pandemic have negatively impacted the country's economic status. Discontent and conflict between the English and French speaking regions weighs heavily on the President as well. President Biya's age and questionable health prior to even factoring in his risk level with COVID19 increase the possibility that he will no longer be able to serve as President for an extended period. President Gnassingbe benefits from wide support despite the extremely poor economic conditions in Togo. Supporters most likely believe he provides political stability at a time when the country has been attempting to improve infrastructure and increase employment opportunities."

Since March this conflict has been on hold due to the pandemic, but an insurgency is always anyways an inherent risk in a multi-decade autocratic rule.

The only way that I can see him not remain in office is if he dies which is a probable scenario given that he is 86 years old and continues to have health issues When it comes to Gnassingbé He will also most likely stay in power as well because the government has already killed protesters who wanted a term limit so the protesters do not have the force to combat them. Also given the fact his family has been in power since the 1960s and that his family has de facto control of both the constitutional court and the Independent National Electoral Commission it is unlikely given the current circumstances that he will be ousted as president anytime soon. https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2019/togo https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2019/cameroon https://www.cameroonintelligencereport.com/biyas-health-panic-in-yaounde/
