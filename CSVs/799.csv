The recent surge in Japan and the declaration of emergency with near lockdown conditions in four regions of the county is placing a lot of pressure on the government and the IOC to postpone. A majority of Japanese oppose holding the Olympics this year by an overwhelming margin. The solid and near definitive declaration of the Japanese government that the Olympics will be held this year is surprising, because it is a relatively new government or at least a relatively new prime minister, which could face an electoral backlash for their deafness of public opinion on the issue. Will continue to monitor this question closely throughout the week, but expect the answer to reach near 100% ""no"" by the end of the week."

Because of this, Japanese officials appear to have expressed that they might cancel the event, only to backtrack, signaling hesitancy on their part. There is also mass public disapproval of hosting the event, according to survey data. On the other hand, cancelling the event would be an expensive choice, and with an event already creating massive losses for Japan, I am not sure if they would want to do this. Moreover, the changes to the event, such as barring foreign fans, could conceivably be used as justification for arguing that it is still safe to continue. If need be, they could modify the event even more, maybe even barring fans altogether (3/4ths of the Olympic revenue comes from TV, so that seems financially plausible for them to consider). Though it seems likely that they would cancel both the Olympic and Paralympic Games together, considering their interconnected nature, the Paralympic Games also occur later and draw much less fans, making it conceivable that they could carry those on safely while cancelling the Olympics. There is not enough information I could find to confirm this, however, so I kept the probabilities close."

Como ya se había anunciado se van a tomar medidas estrictas para los participantes además de limitar al publico no dejando que turistas participen en el evento, por otro lado Japón tiene buenas estadísticas a nivel mundial en base a como han enfrentado la pandemia pero si tomamos a nivel local, es decir, en Asia Japón comparado con sus vecinos no a tenido tan buenos resultados , de igual manera solo si empeorara la situación de forma drástica se consideraría a mi parecer una cancelación de carácter parcial (cancelar Paralímpicos) o si en verdad la situación empeorara sin retorno se consideraría cancelar el evento completo."

Además, el 2 de marzo de este año se publicaron una serie de medidas que deberán tomar los atletas y toda persona involucrada en los juegos para la mejor realización de estos en tiempos de pandemia, entre ellas están una cuarentena de 14 días en Japón antes de competir, restricciones a las actividades sociales fuera de la Villa donde alojarán los atletas, medidas para sus desplazamientos entre instalaciones de los Juegos y un sistema de controles regulares de COVID-19 durante los Juegos. Consideradas todas estas medidas que se han tomado, y sabiendo que se ha logrado la realización de otras fiestas deportivas, como lo son el Super Bowl , NBA, etc, creo que es muy posible y probable que se realicen estos juegos olímpicos 2021.

While it is most likey the game will not ocurr (the logistics and risks are simply staggering) the notion that in just 15 days they will be cancelled is difficult to assimilate. The amount of resources, planning, and variables involved require months of foresight for such a decision. Athletes are still preparing, vaccine rollout is still unsteady, and there has been little international coordination until now to prevent the impact of the pandemic with regards to interventions in events. The politics involved also make this difficult. Many top countries with good vaccine roll out or attempting to presume a good status will desire the Olympics to go forth as a way of proving their success, while others won't. Given the importance of records and the participation of countries, the tug of war to ensue will last longer than the deadline allows for an official cancellation of the games."

Lo mismo para el otro lado, si cancelan alguno será ambos o ninguno, de igual manera tengo la impresión que puedan pensar en solo cancelar los paralímpicos, dado que hoy en día a nivel mundial se llevan a cabo la mayoría de los deportes como en la normalidad, con las medidas y sanitización correspondiente. Desconozco el lado de los paradeportes y como están hoy en día a nivel mundial por el contexto que nos enfrentamos. Veo de igual manera que no cancelen ninguno de los dos juegos porque, no creo que les convenga realizar cada juego en distintos periodos, hay un mayor gasto y en un solo periodo se pueden perfeccionar mas las medidas respecto al covid y realizar un trabajo casi perfecto, donde se tengan PCR a cada momento y se restrinjan las cosas que son propensas a contagiar. Siento que se puede no cancelar, he visto que en el deporte mundial aún se mantienen los deportes a pesar de que aumentan los casos a nivel mundial."

In case of cancelation they will be both canceled. Just doesn't seem plausible to me to cancel just the much more prestigious Olympics, but not the Paralympics. The only reason for that would be that the Paralympics are later, but again why then not move the whole thing another couple of weeks later into the year.

This is obviously to make sure the impact of COVID is limited. @TheGuardian The torch relay has started on March 25th, which is a clear signal that they wish that the Olympics are going ahead. However, this might still not be the case for the Paralympics. @TheGuardian The book ""Going for the Gold: The Economics of the Olympics” by @RobertBaade and @VictorMatheson (2016) states considerable costs for infrastructure, ceremonial and security. The benefits like tourism will not come to fruition. So the book will not address the lack of income. What we will already know is that the benefits will be near to non-existent. But the reputational damage to cancel the Olympic Games at such a late stage will be always remembered in the history books. Even though it might make sense to cancel the games from a financial perspective, Tokyo would not like to be labelled as the games that never happened. The main obstacle is the assurance that athletes will not be infected. This might prove a challenge, as many athletes participating in the Indoor European Athlectics Championships in Poland during March 2021 were tested positive for COVID during the event. Knowing that you cannot avoid athletes mingling (especially during a Summer Olympic Games event where 42 condoms per athlete were purchased in 2016). @TheGuardian When the Olympics go ahead then it allowing the Paralympics to go ahead seems logical. The Paralympics are not a money-making event with low attendance, riding on the wave of the investments made for the Olympics. This makes it more logical to cancel both the Olympic and Paralympics instead of one of them. Cancelling the Paralympics only would be difficult to defend from just a cost perspective."

That's a pretty strong incentive to hold the Games that will be hard to overcome. It also very expensive to host a Games. This one alone is estimated to have cost around $25 billion. Again, another strong incentive. A third strong incentive is that organizers also pretty clearly have what they think is a strong medical/mitgation. That plan will provide a sense of security and enable organizers to convince themselves that holding the Games is the right course, even if they ultimately end up being wrong. When doing their risk analysis the worst case scenario will be an outbreak, which, if one occurs, they can cancel mid games, which is clearly a better option than not having them at all. Another factor organizers will likely consider is that the most fit athletes in the world are not in the target population for folks who are at risk to die from COVID, so they are likely more willing to take some risks, especially with several billion dollars in the balance.

Cancelling the Olympics only would not make monetary sense as the games in 2021 will be mainly broadcast games (=> commercials...) and the viewers' interest in the Paraolympics is lower in comparison to their interest in the Olympics. Participating athletes and/or countries might be less, due to their specific Covid situation, though the vaccination rate among the athletes, trainers, etc. not only on the guests' side consequently must be 100%, as well as among those engaged with organizing the games on the Japanese side. In this concern, I regard the Japanese government as more powerful than the Japanese people. Even if the enthusiasm for having the games is low within the Japanese population, the government will see this as a challenge to prove that they don't break the same promise twice. The 15.000 athletes (or significantly far less this time) + their huge entourage will be ""stored away"" from the local population, so I see no big risk of contagion here. The trust in vaccination might be lower in Japan than in some other countries (65% are willing to get the shot), but publicly communicated behaviour has a normative force, and as soon as vaccinations run and being vaccinated is combined with certain facilitations, the rate of sceptics will decrease. With increasing vaccination rate and therewith declinig Covid-cases, general confidence slowly will increase and the attitude towards big events will turn more positive."

Either they'll be held this year, or they'll be held next year. Update 4/17: I'm starting to feel a little nervous about this forecast, as some leaders in Japan are calling for the Olympics to be canceled or postponed. The Olympic organizing committee is protesting that the games will go forward, but the lady doth protest too much, methinks. The question is, if they do cancel, will they officially announce this before May 1? Only 13 days remain in the forecast period. I don't think they'll cancel in the remaining 13 days, even though cases/day could approach numbers from the winter peak if insufficient control measures are taken. It's a bit of a tough call. https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-expand-quasi-emergency-measures-casting-fresh-doubts-olympics-2021-04-16/ Update 4/18: The prime minister has crushed any notion that the Olympics won't go forward. https://www.newsweek.com/exclusive-japanese-prime-minister-yoshihide-suga-shuts-down-speculation-tokyo-olympics-delay-1584437 """"It's already decided that the Games will take place,"" Suga told Newsweek. ""So based upon [that] decision, preparations are underway."" Suga said he and the International Olympic Committee, the Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government came to that full-stop decision very recently. Pressed by Newsweek on any possibility there could still be a delay or cancellation of the Olympics, Suga reiterated that was no longer an option on the table."" https://apnews.com/article/world-war-ii-tokyo-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-tokyo-olympics-japan-bec3d048e9b962e5a577eca120cc664b"

An outright cancellation has thus clearly required extraordinary circumstances in the past. However, the Covid-19 pandemic is an extraordinary circumstance. A key difference between the world wars of the past century and the current pandemic, though, is that relief, if not an outright end, is in sight. Multiple effective vaccines are in production and distribution worldwide, with updates that protect from known immune-escape variants on the way. While this coming fall and winter (2020-2021) could be dominated by circulation of immune-escape variants, it seems likely to me that the combined effects of cumulative exposure and vaccination will bring worldwide immunity to far higher levels and virus circulation to far lower levels by next summer in the Northern Hemisphere. Thus, it would seem most likely to me that the most probable worst-case scenario would be postponement of the Olympics and/or Paralympics to next summer."

COVID is the main risk of cancellation and may still be significant, directly or indirectly. I'd start by taking the risk of cancellation up to 25% after a skim of info. - Case rates in Japan have fallen substantially since the Jan21 peak, but vaccination looks to be rolling out slowly. This lowers the chance of cancelling by, say, 10%. - Worldwide rates will continue for the period to be very variable - some athletes will come from high incidence locations. - Keeping people safe is an important political goal and is something of a mitigator of the power of the undoubted political and financial ""sunk investment"" in encouraging holding the games no matter what. - given this, and the report that the Japanese people may be negative about the Olympics (press: 80% against, Jan 21), the politics is less clear than I initially imagined. Taking these 2 last factors, I add 5% back. On the side of saying 'no', as others have noted, mitigations to Covid are now well developed - testing and quarantining, masking and distancing, restrictions on crowds, etc. - the G7 have reportedly stated their support for the games continuing, as have IOC officials. - Other sporting events (tennis, football) have also now restarted or continued, including internationally, suggesting it's unlikely nations or sporting bodies will want to withdraw. Take off 10%. However, it is not surprising that no one is talking up the chance of cancellation - all those speaking have an inherent interest in being optimistic. That does not mean that the Japanese government won't be forced to make the ultimate difficult call eventually. Add back 5 for the gap. It is worth noting that it is possible, if unlikely, that other causes of cancellation could arise - a major earthquake in the Tokyo area; - significant volcanic activity & ash clouds causing air travel to be severely disrupted For both these, the chance is deemed extremely low due to short time span in mind, but not completely negligible. I add 1% to the ""both"" category for these and any other 'black swans'. I can see the potential for paralympians to be slightly more at risk, so add 1% to the minimal risk of just one being cancelled, not the other. But overall, I see little political or practical point otherwise in separating the two. One gap in my knowledge is whether the decision-makers will ultimately be the same or different (e.g. would different decision-makers weigh their duty of care differently for their paralympians?)."

Slow vaccination rates across most of the world and Japanese attitudes towards immigration and willingness to close borders mean they won't risk having people travel to watch it. So how likely is a competitors-only Olympics? While possible, I think it's unlikely - but I don't have particularly good reasons for this intuition - just seems a bit pointless, and not really what anyone wants. The only concern then becomes that whoever is hosting next will also have to postpone, and they may have made their plans on the assumption that the next event will be in 2024/5. Still, I think a 4th wave is likely in lots of places and this will be enough for a cancellation."

I doubt many would want to lose out on this revenue, and the culture significance that the olympics bring. Vaccination roll out across first world countries may not be tracking fantastically but is tracking well enough. Perhaps the olympic committee will buy the required doses needed to make sure all athletes are vaccinated before attending? We have seen in many sports leagues come back to a semblance of normalcy, but with heavy covid protocols in place. Sports leagues like the NBA require athletes to miss games if testing positive for covid. This is the one aspect that gives me pause. As soon as one athlete gets tested positive, and can't compete, the round robin format of many sports in the olympics would essentially disqualify them. This would ruin the legitimacy of much of the competition for athletes and viewers. Finally, if the olympics is cancelled, they'll do the same with the paralympics. I'm leaving room for developments for covid vaccines and announcements by the olympic committee."

It would be very detrimental for all sports and Japan's image to only hold the Olympics and not the Paralympics. Thus, if one occurs, the other will. However, the control of the pandemic situation may not be complete or high enough before July. Thus, if under international pressure, Japan may have to accept the economic loss and postpone (given that they manage to negotiate financial compensations). The situation is still very fluid and many people have doubts (https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/30756126/amid-cancellation-chatter-ioc-tokyo-olympics-organizers-focused-hosting).

Logistics and shipping will also be difficult. We, therefore, maintain our view that a vaccine will not start to be rolled out widely in developed economies before mid-2021. Access to the vaccine will be difficult initially as all developed countries race to acquire sufficient quantities and poorer countries struggle to secure funding. As a result, the rollout in middle-income and emerging countries will take much longer; we do not expect it to take place at a game-changing scale before 2022. The picture appears even bleaker for low-income countries; we do not expect most of these states to have wide access to a vaccine before 2022-23. ========================= I am looking at this question with my emotions rather than a rational mind. The low Income countries won't have a vaccine in time. Will it be fair to hold the Olympics knowing that some athletes/countries cannot participate? Japan already lost a lot of money on this, that however, won't make it fair."

The sunk costs in building the venues and Olympic village are enormous and trying to recoup anything with television revenues and advertising is a must at this point. Cancelling the games in totality would be an unprecedented move; limiting competition based on vaccination, however, may be a more appropriate path if the IOC feels that some more strict measures are needed. If a cancellation were to occur, it would have taken place in 2020. The overall emotional attachment as well of a worldwide 'celebration' of sorts for enduring and overcoming the pandemic is also a pressing factor to get the games to go on. Overall, it is most likely an all or neither; cancelling simply one event (which would most likely be the paralympics) would be a terrible optic that would set back progress by years and something that would draw much global outrage and condemnation, especially from western nations."

Further assume a vaccine is available for 500k spectators by May 2021. If both of these are true the games could proceed. If not, the games cannot be held and could be cancelled or postponed. Cancelled - the entire investment by Japan & atheletes would be lost. If postponed by another year, Japan may be able to ameliorate some costs and some of the same atheletes could particiopate. 2022 is also a Winter Olympics in Beijing. Sponsors may be hard to line up for a 2022 Summer Olympics or for Winter Olympics if held in the same year. This feels like a slow motion train wreck. Can atheletes tread water for two years waiting to participate? Can the IOC really support both games in the same year? They have done it several times, but it's not ideal for them or sponsors.

Estimated the chances to be between 10% and 60% to have a vaccine (here the large uncertainty at this point in time). The baysian computation yields a 50-50% chances of happening, rounded.

In common with other sports events I judge that there will be strong economic incentives to try and do the event behind closed doors if not possible to do it with an attending audience - this eventuality may ultimately be the most likely since they will also have time to prepare for this arrangement. If this is not possible, the IOC/Japan can still choose to postpone again rather than cancel - though noises out of the IOC suggests that this is not a desirable outcome. In principle there is a higher likelihood that the paralympics would be cancelled than the olympics because of the greater risk to the athletes (indeed, I cannot foresee a reason why the olympics would be cancelled on its own) but the public messages on this topic suggest that they are being considered together."
