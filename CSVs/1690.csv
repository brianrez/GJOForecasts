McCain is almost guaranteed, and Flake, Collins, Graham all seem independent of Trump enough to vote against this. Other senators are likely to join them as well. No indication McConnell wants it to happen either. Trump is the main one pushing this, but nobody seems to be listening to him. Democrats are being careful to stay organized and not do anything to give R's a good reason to remove the rule. I'll give a 5% chance because that could change, or various other doomsday scenarios could happen that lead to the removal of the filibuster. But unless there's a big shift somewhere, assume the status quo stays."

So removing the filibuster doesn't help the GOP to achieve its major legislative agenda at this point.

Yes, it could, but it would also increase the scope of any piece of major legislation, bogging down the process while the GOP reconciles its position."

36679,2017-07-31T11:36:56Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],This has been an absolute goal of the Republican Party and its owners for decades now. I do believe it will push very hard to ensure domination. The only hesitation that may waylaid its progress to have complete free reign is that it might not want to appear to be 'unfair'. I would venture to guess it would be certain that it might rather backdoor this by making it even odds and then concentrating on gerrymandering and ensuring voters voices can be ignored. This is also why there are many states who have petitioned to take away amendment rights about protesting protections. It seems likely that the leaks which show people within the party paying for people to disrupt and cause havoc at peaceful protests are genuine. That way they can fan flames of outrage which they created to get what they wanted. It's a win-win.

It's unclear as to whether Congress can continue pursuing AHCA under FY17 reconciliation procedures after October 1. With the weekly crisis coming out of 1600 Pennsylvania, Congress has to focus efforts they would otherwise spend on getting AHCA through. They could attempt to pass major tax reform under FY18 reconciliation procedures, but that likely pushes that legislation into CY18. Any other major piece of legislation, would require bipartisan support to get through the Senate, or elimination of the filibuster."

They can blame the Dems for awhile but will probably eventually decide to just kill the filibuster. They won't worry about future repercussions (i.e., losing the ability to filibuster in the future if they lose their majority) because they have a stranglehold on a majority of state legislatures, where they can continue to enact voter suppression laws."

1201,2017-04-29T18:24:00Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"This is entirely up to Mitch McConnell. This is a matter of changing Senate rules and only the majority leader has the authority to bring that issue to the floor. He will not hesitate to change the rules, but to do it he needs 51 Republican votes. To get those, he needs a big enough issue to make it all worthwhile since eliminating the filibuster could backfire. There is no such issue in the pipeline. Healthcare isn't it: if anything ever comes out of the House, it will be some unlovable mutant that will likely be suffocated in conference so that no Senator has to vote on it publicly. The budget might be it, but that has to start in the House. Even then, McConnell has the option of doing some reconciliation magic to get it through on 51 votes. Wait on this one to see where we are in September. Tax reform might be it, but that, too, has to start in the House and Paul Ryan seems to be having trouble passing the salt, as they say, let alone something as complex as a tax reform package. Were I McConnell, I'd wait for the 2018 mid-terms. The Ds have 25 seats up of which 13 are in play to some degree. The Rs have 9 seats up of which 2 are in play. There's a better than even chance that the Rs could have a filibuster-proof 60 votes in the 116th. Why risk unforeseeable backlash for changing the rules if you can get what you want under the current rules by just holding tight for 18 months? Yes, it's a long game, but McConnell is very good at the long game."

He will start to demand this change very soon, since he has never displayed either understanding of nor patience with the concept of ""implications."" The Rs will very likely cave in, sooner or later. The cloture rule is terrible and should be killed anyway, but it will be sort of sad to see it go out this way."

With the administration unable to achieve much in the first 100 days, and the desire to have some substantial achievement prior to the completion of his first year in office and the subsequent State of the Union, Trump and the R's will want to push forward some major piece of legislation (whether health care or tax reform remains to be seen)."
