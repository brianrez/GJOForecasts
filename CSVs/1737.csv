29469,2017-03-05T15:15:30Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"The case against Android's dominant position in the app market seems misguided and would set problematic precedents in the IT domain. The case against the presentation of ads in Google search is more credible, and the fact that some differing cases have been merged under this one case would suggest the Commission is putting a fair bit of resources into the investigation. The time it has taken in the past for resolution of IT antitrust cases in the EU has ranged from 1-4 years for companies such as Microsoft (on several occasions) and Intel. The proceedings in the latter Google case were opened in July 2016, hence the earliest we could expect a decision is in Autumn 2017. Given that these cases concern new technology and business models there will not be many precedents to draw from making the process longer. In addition, Google has sufficient resources to mount a serious legal challenge to the investigation so can draw out the process further. In the end I think it's likely Google will end up having to slightly tweak its ads systems in the EU and pay a fine, but that won't be in 2017."

Google will want to delay as long as possible and there is no legal deadline for the European Commission to conclude this case so it may take a while longer.

Considering the amounts fined the European Banks by the US it will not be surprising to see similar actions against Alphabet, Microsoft and other US multinationals with significant accumulations of earnings outside the US often in Europe. These types of fines are adjusted so as to maximize the collection without destroying the company. Such as the US fine to the German bank and as will probably end of being the case with Volkswagen. If a US tax holiday of say 10% on repatriated earnings by US companies comes into being as is being considered there will be a quick and massive return of this money to be used for dividend payout, loan paydown, stock buy back and maybe even investment in the business. It will certainly be in part to remove these targeted pools of money from governments sight and reach."
