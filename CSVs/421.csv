Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020–2021): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_United_States_troops_from_Afghanistan_(2020%E2%80%932021) Clips from Wikipedia article: 'The Trump administration completed its reduction of forces to 2,500 troops in January 2021, the lowest number of American soldiers in Afghanistan since 2001. As of January 2021, there are more than seven contractors for each U.S. military service member remaining in Afghanistan, amounting to over 18,000 contractors according to figures from U.S. Central Command. In January 2021, then-incoming president Joe Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that the U.S. would review the peace agreement in order to effectively withdraw its remaining 2,500 soldiers from Afghanistan. Biden supported a full withdrawal in 2014 but it was initially unclear as to whether he would uphold Trump's May 2021 withdrawal deadline. In March 2021, news reports stated that President Biden was potentially considering keeping U.S. forces in Afghanistan until November 2021. On 14 April 2021, Biden announced his intention to withdraw all regular U.S. troops by 11 September 2021, the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks and four months after the initially planned 1 May deadline. The day before the announcement, Biden called former U.S. presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama regarding his decision to withdraw. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the decision was made in order to focus resources on China and the COVID-19 pandemic. Following withdrawal, the U.S. is reportedly considering options for redeploying troops such as relocating to U.S. Navy vessels, countries in the Middle East, or Central Asian countries like Tajikistan.' On 18 February 2021, Secretary-General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg said that the alliance has not made a decision on how to proceed regarding the withdrawal. Britain is expected to withdraw its remaining 750 Resolute Support Mission troops at the same time as the U.S. According to the plan, NATO troops would also follow the same withdrawal timeline. The U.S. indicated that some troops (the exact number had not yet been decided) will remain in the country to provide diplomatic security, and is unclear what will happen to the several hundred U.S. special operations forces working for the CIA on counter-terrorism missions. New CIA Director William Joseph Burns told the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee on 14 April 2021 that ""[t]here is a significant risk once the U.S. military and the coalition militaries withdraw"" but added that the U.S. would retain ""a suite of capabilities.""

Both the US and UK diplomatic staff are relocating to be closer to the airport (and escape) coupled with the danger of getting from Kabul to the airport.

However, the pace of withdrawal of forces is fast which indicates withdrawal will be completed by deadline so that makes less likely to target US and thus evacuating US personnel from Embassy in Afghanistan.

Basically, if the Kabul government falls then the embassy falls. But it seems it would be a very symbolic thing for the Kabul government to fall within a few months of the United States pulling out, so I imagine that considerable effort would be put into holding that fortified area."

Given their territorial gains over the past year (Long War Journal), it is likely (70% probability) that the Taliban will take full control of Afghanistan, including Kabul, by the end of the year. The Taliban have suggested that the group is likely to achieve this through an agreement (on their terms) rather than through military conquest (Politico). Secondly, and under the condition that the Taliban take over, the question is whether the Taliban will accept/tolerate the presence of approx. 650 troops to provide security for the US embassy which is a prerequisite for the embassy to remain (The Hill, Reuters). The Taliban have officially rejected this (BBC). However, the intent and preparations of the US to maintain the presence appears to be high (Politico). This comes also on the backdrop of a potential civilian NATO mission to Afghanistan and the plan for Turkey to take over the management of Kabul airport, including the international hospital which is critical for any foreign presence in the country (Politico) (70%). Taliban could at least temporarily/until the end of the year tolerate the presence as part of a deal with the Afghan government as they consolidate control (20%). Overall, the probability for this to happen is 7% (10% (remainder of 70%+20%) of 70%)."

Some troops will operate counter-rocket systems known as C-RAMs, which each have Gatling guns that shoot 4,500 rounds per minute.' 'Overseeing the embassy security mission is Rear Adm. Peter Vasely, a two-star Navy SEAL officer who was slated to oversee Special Operations in Afghanistan before Biden called for a withdrawal. “He was available. He had the experience,” Marine Gen. Kenneth “Frank” McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, said during a recent visit to Afghanistan. “I know and trust him.” Vasely’s team will operate partly out of the old NATO military headquarters, which will belong to the embassy. Security at the compound is now provided by the State Department, McKenzie said. While Biden’s plan envisions U.S. air power being used in the post-withdrawal period only to target groups such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, McKenzie said any threats against the embassy or the Kabul airport could be an exception. If security deteriorates rapidly, the U.S. military trains specialized forces for missions like temporarily seizing an airfield to enable evacuation flights. Or, in drastic circumstances, it could launch a noncombatant evacuation operation as was done in Saigon in 1975 and Mogadishu in 1991.'

Biden is somewhat disingenuous when he states ‘No nation has ever unified Afghanistan. Empires have gone there and not done it’, suggesting some altruistic actions to unify the tribes of that country. The country could be construed as ungovernable given that as stated by the Middle East Institute, the concentration of power at the local level is so strong, that even the core institutions of the state are undersiege by local interests. The reasons for invasion are therefore geo-political. The British wanted to control Afghanistan to deter the Russians from invading southwards in the 19th Century which lost an army in 1842 but gained a diplomatic solution in 1880, but no control."
