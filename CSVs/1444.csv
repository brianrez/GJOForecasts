"In Murphy v. NCAA, will the Supreme Court rule that Congress cannot prohibit New Jersey from amending or repealing its existing prohibitions on sports gambling?",2017-12-08T18:00:56Z,2018-05-14T06:59:30Z,Yes,"['Yes', 'No']","['Society', 'US Policy']",300,654,230,237,"By a count of 7-2, the question closed with ""Yes"" with an end date of 14 May. (SCOTUS) In 2016, the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) prohibited the state of New Jersey from repealing certain laws regarding sports gambling (The Chicago Tribune). New Jersey appealed that decision to the Supreme Court, arguing that Congress does not have the authority to prohibit amendment or repeal of those laws (SCOTUSBlog, The Washington Post). The Supreme Court is expected to hand down its decision in its current term, but if it does not, the question will resolve as no. Confused?

The States have no Constitutional authority to overrule Federal laws. A 20% chance to include the ""SCOTUS Nullification"" factor, as SCOTUS ruled in Van Orden v. Perry, where the different versions of the 10 Commandments was ignored and the Catholic version of the 10 was permitted over the Tora/ King James translations, thus 'Establishing' the Catholic version ""Thou shall not kill,"" over the Mosaic Law's "" Thou shall do no murder."" Doesn't take a genius to see that American jurisprudence is based in part on the difference between a complete prohibition of killing (conscientious objectors, et al.) vs justifiable homicide, such as a soldier in war. (At least sending the argument up the line, had the late great Associate Justice Scalia to admit in open court that he (Scalia) didn't know something: Numerous English versions of the Bible on the market, whose translations vary widely, IE 10 Commandments differences, or John 1-12 ( IE Sons of God, Children of God, Sons and Daughters of God, Servants of God, Slaves of God, et al.) ~Prof.Rath USMC Combat Wounded Warrior Persian Gulf War Green Valley"

This case also involves not just sports betting but the internet which the right-wing SCOTUS and Congress also want to rein in and control. So this is a HUGE case and a Constitutional one but these days SCOTUS is more ideological than constitutional though in this case it may turn out to be both. I do not see how the US Congress can give a huge benefit to one state and deny the same to another, under our Constitution. But Congress violates the Constitution all the time these days. Plus Republicans are mad at the NFL just now. No, I do not think SCOTUS judges are politically independent any more; sadly, it makes them much less authoritative and harms our Republic greatly. There is also an argument that SCOTUS would be ""legislating from the bench"" by giving all states the same rights but, again, the right-wing SCOTUS does it all the time, no matter what Scalia said. This is a HUGE case with MASSIVE implications. Sadly we do not have a SCOTUS that will focus on the law and the Constitution instead of politics and ideology.

As PASPA prohibited the state's involvement in sports betting, the Sports Wagering Act of 2014 was designed to allow casinos and racetracks to provide sports betting without the state being involved in the licensing or regulating of sports betting. The NCAA, NBA, NFL, NHL, and MLB once again sued the state. The federal district court sided with the leagues. The governor's office appealed to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the lower court’s ruling. The state appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to take up the case. https://ballotpedia.org/Christie_v._NCAA?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=DailyBrew This case hangs on a new phrase - the Commandeering clause in the constitution.... In brief: After New Jersey modified its restrictions on legalized gambling in 2014, pursuant to a ruling in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and four professional sports leagues filed suit in federal court to prevent enforcement of the New Jersey law. The leagues argued that a competing federal law, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), prohibited any state government involvement in gambling on amateur or professional team games. New Jersey argued that its 2014 modifications removed the provisions allowing for legalized gambling on team games and that PASPA offered states no alternatives. By requiring states to prohibit actions that Congress itself could do by legislation, New Jersey argued that PASPA violated the Constitution's anti-commandeering doctrine, which states that ""Congress 'lacks the power directly to compel the States to require or prohibit' acts which Congress itself may require or prohibit.""[3] A federal district court rejected New Jersey's argument. The Third Circuit, sitting en banc, agreed with the lower court. Argument in the case was held on December 4, 2017."
