A base rate informed by pre-COVID attack trends between the US & Iran, IMO, must be modified to reflect the COVID context. In which direction? Let's look at the domestic contexts for action (inside view): Iran: significant COVID infection scandal; poor public opinion of govt; increasingly diminished resources thanks to sanctions, COVID, and oil market crash; continued anti-American rhetoric and warnings; public still smarting over Soleimani death US: bellicose POTUS that responded violently to Iranian provocations/attacks previously; almost 1 million COVID cases; upcoming presidential election; devastated economy; tweets for US Navy to destroy Iranian ships that harass them. These factors could tip the balance in either way (attack to distract, rally around the flag or don't attack bc it exacerbates uncertainty too much). I lean toward the latter--the risk of exacerbating uncertainty will be too high for both governments during COVID, but I think the inside view is mostly indeterminate. The outside view should consider the average rate of attack annually (monthly?) between the US and Iran, the targets of those attacks (are national forces postured at the targets), the accuracy of those attacks (probability of killing a national force) as a rough start point. Based on the calculations of these probabilities by smart people below, I'd say the general base rate is very low, 10-20%, but is elevated in 2020 given the number of attacks that have taken place within the last six months and the momentum this has generated, so I bump to the 20-30% probability."

A base rate informed by pre-COVID attack trends between the US & Iran, IMO, must be modified to reflect the COVID context. In which direction? Let's look at the domestic contexts for action (inside view): Iran: significant COVID infection scandal; poor public opinion of govt; increasingly diminished resources thanks to sanctions, COVID, and oil market crash; continued anti-American rhetoric and warnings; public still smarting over Soleimani death US: bellicose POTUS that responded violently to Iranian provocations/attacks previously; almost 1 million COVID cases; upcoming presidential election; devastated economy; tweets for US Navy to destroy Iranian ships that harass them. These factors could tip the balance in either way (attack to distract, rally around the flag or don't attack bc it exacerbates uncertainty too much). I lean toward the latter--the risk of exacerbating uncertainty will be too high for both governments during COVID, but I think the inside view is mostly indeterminate. The outside view should consider the average rate of attack annually (monthly?) between the US and Iran, the targets of those attacks (are national forces postured at the targets), the accuracy of those attacks (probability of killing a national force) as a rough start point. Based on the calculations of these probabilities by smart people below, I'd say the general base rate is very low, 10-20%, but is elevated in 2020 given the number of attacks that have taken place within the last six months and the momentum this has generated, so I bump to the 20-30% probability."

That being the case, it has been seen as an obvious stoking of tensions in the reason and with the US as it is a breach of international norms and expectations. However, since then, the Trump administration has responded by pushing economic sanctions and sought UN approval in their pursuit, signaling that, at the moment, they do not wish to respond with force. This may change in the future, especially given that the UN is not eager to restart sanctions given that they only recently had to abandon an agreement with Iran due to the American government's sudden withdrawal. If the UN does reject the president's plea to action it is possible tensions could escalate to the point of physical conflict, but I believe we are still quite far away from any direct confrontation at the moment. More likely, a mistake could be made be one side or the other resulting in an incidental casualty that could satisfy the requirements of this question."

That said the current POTUS seems quite reluctant to engage in overseas conflict. Given the number of months to the deadline is quite short the likelihood of lethal confrontation is therefore low but the volatility of the region must be acknowledged.

A base rate informed by pre-COVID attack trends between the US & Iran, IMO, must be modified to reflect the COVID context. In which direction? Let's look at the domestic contexts for action (inside view): Iran: significant COVID infection scandal; poor public opinion of govt; increasingly diminished resources thanks to sanctions, COVID, and oil market crash; continued anti-American rhetoric and warnings; public still smarting over Soleimani death US: bellicose POTUS that responded violently to Iranian provocations/attacks previously; almost 1 million COVID cases; upcoming presidential election; devastated economy; tweets for US Navy to destroy Iranian ships that harass them. These factors could tip the balance in either way (attack to distract, rally around the flag or don't attack bc it exacerbates uncertainty too much). I lean toward the latter--the risk of exacerbating uncertainty will be too high for both governments during COVID, but I think the inside view is mostly indeterminate. The outside view should consider the average rate of attack annually (monthly?) between the US and Iran, the targets of those attacks (are national forces postured at the targets), the accuracy of those attacks (probability of killing a national force) as a rough start point. Based on the calculations of these probabilities by smart people below, I'd say the general base rate is very low, 10-20%, but is elevated in 2020 given the number of attacks that have taken place within the last six months and the momentum this has generated, so I bump to the 20-30% probability.

This raises a bit the probability that the Iran hawks in the US may exacerbate tensions and provoke a clash.

The Islamic Republic News Agency barely mentions Soleimani - it lacks the front page fiery anti-U.S. rhetoric that would likely characterize an Iranian state-sanctioned response. Similarly, the Official Website of the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran does not mention Soleimani and the Official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran makes only one front-page mention of Soleimani (dating from a 11 February 2020 article). Moreover, major U.S. news agencies have not reported any prominent statements emanating from Iran since late January. Further, despite the deployment of a 4,000-member Brigade from the 82nd Airborne, and some minor force protection enhancements in the region, the U.S. has not made public any major deployments of forces in the wake of the strike (e.g., carrier battle groups, Marine Expeditionary Forces, strike aircraft, Tomahawk-capable submarines, etc.). Likewise, open source intelligence has not reported any concerning Iranian troop or strategic asset movements (deployment of ballistic missile batteries to firing points, movement of troops to assembly areas, etc.). As such, it stands to reason that any retaliatory measures by Iran would have been initiated while the event was still fresh in the national memory. Either Iran is still in a ""wait and see"" period of assessing U.S. strategic moves while planning long-range escalatory measures, or Iran has accepted the strike as U.S. signaling that it had crossed a U.S. ""red line,"" and intends to back down any provocative actions for the foreseeable future. This suggests to me that Iran will likely ""lay low"" for a while, until such time it decides to incrementally test the boundaries of U.S. strategic action, which in my opinion, will not be for several more months. Accordingly, at this point I am assessing the probability of a lethal confrontation involving at least one fatality between the military forces of either side in the airspace, seaspace, or landspace of Iran as low and very unlikely. Since there are still roughly 10-11 months remaining on the question, however, I'm leaving a margin open to the possibility."

Since no US servicemembers were killed in the missile attack, there was no US response (that was made public, anyway) and thus the likelihood of a lethal mil-mil confrontation at sea or in Iran dropped significantly. It's now been over a month since the Iran attacks, and though it turned out that over 100 US servicemembers sustained brain injuries in the attack, any path toward the above-described scenario seems remote. Most likely path is a confrontation at sea; most likely scenario is one where Iranian ship gets too close to a US ship, is perceived as a threat, and is fired upon by US sailors in self defense. Though a commonly discussed scenario, it's never happened before. Assigning 7% to account for potential that Iran may not feel that missile strike sent a sufficiently strong message and chooses to be more aggressive at sea, setting conditions for the scenario to unfold."

Given the history of military conflict between Iran and Iraq, I thought this to be excellent insight into the potential decision making calculus of Iranian officials.

Though a confrontation in this area would fall outside of the scope of this question, it does have the potential for follow up operations within Iranian controlled spaces (land, sea, air). 3) Unplanned encounter that escalates to lethal confrontation (i.e. accidents happen) - An unplanned encounter is the least predictable, and I believe, most likely scenario from which a lethal confrontation could occur.

Trump has demonstrated his willingness to act aggressively, and even Iran’s favored asymmetrical weapon, oil price shocks, is not as effective as it might have been under Bush or Obama because of America’s recent status as a net exporter, rather than importer, of oil. However, I am placing the forecast at 39% (not lower) because the question sets a low bar by defining “lethal” as a single fatality. As shown by the downed commercial Ukrainian aircraft in early January, Iran’s forces may be unpredictable or inept, and the loss of a single life could easily occur (though, of course, Iran would be fully aware of Trump’s retaliation should a US soldier be killed)."

Militarily it will take a relatively short amount of time to devastate the regular Iranian military and fixed place infrastructure with the firepower currently available to the US in the Gulf. Then the pain will start for the US, probably first with cyber, asymmetrical targets both military and civilian, suicide bombs and, most likely, new and devastating IED's, around the clock missile attacks on Isreal and Gulf allies with likely disruption of the entire world economy as the narrow Gulf Straits become unpassable, possibly even the Suez canal if Iran truly thinks it is end game. Next, the body bags start coming home and our society convulses in real and imagined subversion, allowing further erosion of civil liberties in the name of securing the homeland. For all those no-win reasons the war will be fought in the shadows where both sides can claim innocence even as they encourage their proxies and covert operators to do the deniable.

First, my original base rate was roughly 13% based on how few of incidents have occurred in the past 40+ years since the current Iranian government took power in 1979. I'm not aware of any lethal conflicts between the US and Iran that specifically took place inside Iran or at sea since the mid-80s during the Iran-Iraq war. Given the roughly 30-year gap in lethal conflicts inside the geographic parameters and the corresponding impact to the scope of the timeline of the question, I assess this makes the base rate lower. Second, I increased my first forecast from the initial base rate based on the current situation. However, updates to the current situation warrant lowering the forecast. Iran accepting responsibility for the shoot down of the Ukrainian airliner decreases the likelihood of Iran conducting higher risk activities at sea or close to its borders in the near term (3-4 months). Also, US public opinion according to Gallup is against military conflict with Iran. As the next US election gets closer, I assess that US senior leaders will look to non-military responses (such as economic or diplomatic) before using any lethal military options against Iran."

Potentially, this will force a direct confrontation between the U.S. military and Iranian military to some degree. Iran has indicated the ballistic missile attack on US bases in Iraq was ""not enough"" - their prestige is at stake, many in the Iranian government likely view themselves at war with the US any way and see confrontation as both necessary and inevitable.

81447,2020-01-09T07:45:06Z,1,[3.0],[3.0],"In the detente following the Soleimani assassination, it became clear that neither side wants to escalate the conflict. Iran's funding is hurt by sanctions and although China has offered military (and financial assistance via oil purchases that do not require settlement in USD), I do not believe their economy can project power outside of Iran and the region effectively enough to make a significant statement to the US. Accordingly, they will suffer larger losses than the US. As for the US, there doesn't appear to be sufficient internal support for another conflict in the middle east and the region's allies are not interested in conflict at this time. Saudi is trying to expand its economy past petroleum centric activities and is even inviting tourism to the country (which will be hurt by conflict). Bahrain is teetering on bankruptcy. UAE has Expo 2020 on in October and so wants to ensure the event is successful and that will be measured by increased tourism for the event and afterwards. A task that is made difficult by regional conflict, particularly as Iran suggested that any escalation by the US will be countered by attacks on Dubai. Qatar seems to be surviving its regionally-imposed sanctions but with the world cup it is hosting coming up cannot risk regional conflict as it is unlikely (based on past conflicts) to be finished in time. It may also complicate completion timelines for a lot of the new infrastructure that needs to be built out in Qatar in advance of the event, particularly if shipping access via the Straight of Hormuz is compromised. In other words, no one regionally is incentivised to enter into a conflict that may very well turn into a prolonged regional conflict and that regional pressure on the US can lead to some interesting compromise (another topic altogether). I do give a minor probability to ""lethal conflict"" because there is always uncertainty, however improbable. Events which would increase the chance of conflict would be significant pivot by Gulf States to sell oil denominated in currencies (or gold) other than the US$. The need for foreigners to buy USTs is become a major ""hidden"" funding issue (unless you subscribe to MMT). Regardless, whilst the US government can self-fund by printing more money, effects on repo and other funding markets might not be able to cope and thus there may be economic incentives for the US to apply pressure to Gulf States to sell oil for dollars. However, there are many ways to get there without the need for conflict and so the probability here is small. Another reason for a small risk is that Iran is not an ideal country to attack. It is mountainous and largely uninhabitable and therefore after the air strikes would take out most of the country's strike capabilities, a ground force would be required to effect regime change and that would likely be a protracted battle against a very large army (much larger than Iraqi) with more sophisticated weaponry with established support from both Russia and China. I can probably write another page of reasons but this should be sufficient."

What is the US War Powers Resolution of 1973? = Congress has the power to declare war while the president, as commander-in-chief, has the power to use the military to defend the US. This is not new; the War Powers Act - which was enacted in 1973 about the veto of then-President Richard Nixon. Congress wanted to constrain Nixon's ability to further commit US forces to the unpopular Vietnam War. 2. Why are war powers an issue now? = The air raid Trump ordered on Soleimani - a significant escalation - late last month in Iraq was undertaken without consultation or notice to Congress. It put US forces into imminent conflict, even a potential war with Iran that Congress has not authorised, Democrats argue. The Trump administration has [ratcheted up tensions](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/understanding-iran-deal-coming-180509072633096.html) with Iran since taking office in 2017. One of Trump's first decisions was to unilaterally withdraw from the 2015 United Nations-backed Iran nuclear deal, the JCPOA. 3. In recent years, there has been a continuing debate in Congress on whether the 2001 and 2002 authorisations should be replaced with a new, more narrowly tailored congressional authority for US military action (In recent years, there has been a continuing debate in Congress on whether the 2001 and 2002 authorisations should be replaced with a new, more narrowly tailored congressional authority for US military action.) Retaliatory Measures by the USA: The purpose of stricter sanctions is not to change Iran’s behavior, but to crush the Iranian economy in an attempt to destabilize the regime. Iran is now in a US-induced depression, with GDP down 14% between 2017 and 2019 and inflation in 2019 at 36% (both according to [recent IMF estimates](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2019/02/weodata/index.aspx)), and severe shortages of medicines and other vital goods. Iran is unlikely to back down. 1. It has many options at its disposal, including a wide range of military, economic, and diplomatic targets in many countries in the region. It can operate directly or through proxies; it can use armed force or cyberattacks. 2. The US could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the Middle East and to use them in response to what Iran does, a path that could lead to additional Iranian provocations. — The US currently has 60,000 troops in the Middle East and North Africa, according to the Pentagon. — 3. All this could occur at a time of growing concern about North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, Russian military threats to Europe, the weakening of arms-control arrangements meant to curb US-Russian nuclear competition, and the arrival of a new era of technological, economic, military and diplomatic competition with China. COMMENTS: First thought is that there is a lot of time to go before this question resolves, and a lot can happen in the meantime. However, Congress will try to cool down the Presidential rage against Iran. At home the President has a lot of problems already, and is showing more and more instability."

President Donald Trump tweeted: “Assessment of casualties & damages taking place now. So far, so good!”. Yet it is hard to imagine that the violence, unleashed by the assassination in Baghdad on January 3rd of Qassem Suleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, ends here. Brigadier-General Esmail Ghaani, General Suleimani’s successor, has said that Iran’s priority will be to “remove America’s presence from the region”. That is a tall order, but Iran does have further means to avenge itself: maritime disruption, cyber warfare, attacks on America’s Gulf allies.

Soleimanis initiative was to weaken the US position in the middle east all along so this is like a legacy attack.

Once this happens, there will be a 90 chance of Trump launching a counter-attack. The only question is where. Of course, the US has no presence in Iran. Therefore, Iran cannot attack the US in Iran. It can attack the US in the Gulf with small boats. However, this would be very dangerous for the Iranian soldiers on the boats; they would likely consider any such attack a suicide mission and not very effective. Thus, it is possible but unlikely (10 %). Iran's American jets that it kept after the revolution seem to have disappeared--probably due to lack of spare parts and overuse during the Iran-Iraq war. (5%) Iran did obtain some military jets from Iraq during the Gulf War. However, all of these jets are old and would likely be easy targets for a modern US aircraft carrier or small ship. (5%) Also, Iran's UAV's probably could not reach an American ship. Thus, there is a less than 10% chance of Iran attacking the US Navy in the Gulf.

Looking at the timeline here https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/iran-tensions-timeline-events-leading-soleimani-killing-200103152234464.html (thanks @kerryb ), it seems that if either side was aiming for a military escalation, they would have done so already. On the other hand, I wonder whether at least the impression of a threat or immanent more open military confrontation is considered beneficial for odds of re-election? Which, if true, in turn begs the question whether Trump can keep the impression of a crisis going without an actual escalation."

[1] I think it still provides a useful outside view for this question, but I think the inside view is probably more relevant right now. Right now there are two main actors, Trump and Iran's leadership. Trump seems prone to conflict in the region - he seems to think it'll improve his elections odds given his proclivity for saying Obama would start wars to win elections - and if he wishes could easily start targeting Iran forces within Iran. In addition, Republican leadership seems to support this action which may increase his probability of going forward [2]. Even if they are skeptical behind closed doors, they have no way of limiting his power without coming out and opposing him publicly. Trump may also be gauging how the public responds to this tactic. If it sufficiently positive, he may be incentivized to go further. Similarly, Iranian leadership wants to retaliate and they've shown they're willing to take action in recent months. [3] Again, it seems as though pursuing action through proxies would be the simpler tactic, I think escalation is very possible."
60077,2020-01-04T01:53:39Z,1,[28.0],[28.0],"It’s certainly possible, but at this point, if it happens, it would likely be the result of local-level miscalculation and blindly following bureaucratic routines and SOPs rather than any deliberate government policy on either side. Iran’s objective is not to goad the US into a costly conventional war they know they are unlikely to win, but rather lure the US into an unconventional proxy conflict in Iraq or elsewhere in which they do stand a realistic chance of winning or at least obtaining a favorable settlement. Their interests are much better served (and at much lower cost) by standing back while their proxies and clients do all the dirty work of bloodying US forces with the help of Iranian arms and advisors, ultimately drawing the US into a long-term, un-winnable stalemate and war of attrition, and waiting for the US to inevitably defeat itself through growing public divisions and yawning government “credibility gaps” (no doubt supplemented with a healthy dose of Russia-aided social-media psy-ops and propaganda warfare campaign). This is exactly what the Iranian military has been preparing for over the past 10-15 years. Assuring this outcome also gives incentive to higher-ups in the Iranian government to demand that ground-level officers and bureaucrats exercise additional restraint and tighten up their procedures to circumvent the possibility of an untimely direct confrontation between conventional forces at the present stage that could escalate into an undesirable scenario."
