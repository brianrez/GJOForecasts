Some are even calling for a military intervention against the country's Supreme Court."

He is being investigated in multiple fronts but the processes are slow and the one with most potential for impeachment is the CPI (Inquiry Parliament Committee) which won't end soon. Besides, Impeachment is the main way that he can be removed, while it also took over two months to succeed under Rousseff's presidency. The last impeachment being not long ago also creates resistance, as the repercussions of Bolsonaro's impeachment would undermine the image of democracy, the people's trust in their chosen candidates, and other factors."

Una de las principales causas de esto, podría ser la terrible gestión con que ha manejado la pandemia, registrando hasta la fecha más de 360.000 fallecidos y más de 3.600 en la última jornada, eso sumado al bajo porcentaje de vacunación de la población. Otro de lo motivos se podría atribuir a la mala situación económica que el país esta enfrentando ya que en 2020 el PIB brasileño se redujo un 4,1% con relación al año anterior, además el desempleo ha llegado al 15%, su nivel más alto desde 2012, y el coste de la vida se eleva por la alta inflación. Todo lo anterior ha hecho que la aprobación de presidente caiga drásticamente, teniendo un 44% de desaprobación general y un 54% de desaprobación a su gestión de la pandemia."
