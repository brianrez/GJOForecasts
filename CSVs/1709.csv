"Between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018, will an armed group from Bangladesh engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Bangladesh?",2017-03-31T17:00:53Z,2017-07-01T06:59:53Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],208,654,72,237,"The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (Early Warning Project). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 30 June 2017 and will be resolved in April 2018 after EWP assesses the situation in Bangladesh from April 2017 to March 2018. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilians fatalities occur in one or more campaigns. See (Early Warning Project) for examples. See (GJ Open) for GJâ€™s FAQ on forecasting questions like this. Confused?

A major genocide took place in the early 1970s and the US conservatively estimates the death toll to be 200,000 individuals. Besides border disputes and a minor refugee crisis, Bangladesh appears to be the safest of all the at risk nations of the Early Warning Project. The country is populated by 161 million people, and compared to the other at risk nations, the ethnic groups are homogeneous. If I were forced to choose a country to visit on the Early Warning Project list of at risk nations, Bangladesh is my top choice. There has been a handful of acute violent acts targeting civilians, but world players are paying close attention and funding Bangladeshis' infrastructure projects. I believe no armed group from within Bangladesh with systematically kill 1,000 or more civilians within Bangladesh before April 1, 2018."

Very few mainstream outlets consider covering Bangladesh an important fact. This reality does not fall in deaf ears from the Bangladeshi power structured and they take advantage of this deafness. The number of 1000 civilians fatalities makes this event at this point a low provability event, but this does not means that they might end the year with near this number if things continue the present way. Again, like in many of the present countries Bangladesh is one of those places where truth is difficult to encounter and cover ups are part of the modus operandi."
