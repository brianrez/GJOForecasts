However, she has a somewhat strong challenger in Caruso-Cabrera (https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/09/chamber-commerce-aoc-primary-challenger-175917), and there are also two other challengers (unless they drop out before June 23). Intuitively, this would push her closer to 50% or even below 50%. I think there's little chance she loses outright, maybe a little under 10%.
