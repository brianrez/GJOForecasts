Also reflecting the crowd forecast, I am giving it another 7% as the new minister of the interior is more moderate which allows for a scenario that an actually more moderate cabinet builds up behind Truss who is allowed to govern until the Tory polls have recovered.With the next UK election being scheduled for Jan 2025, I would give a very high 85%+ probability for Truss' term finding a preemptive end. The question here is currently whether the Tories will give her a couple more months or whether they can install someone else."

Hunt backed Sunak in the last leadership campaign and wanted to cut corporation tax (which is now being u-turned on). The idea must be to put him there to reassure and reunite the party (other cabinet members are essentially all Truss supporters from the leadership campaign). The speed of the announcement suggests this move was also planned ahead (how far?) given that Hunt is also out of the country right so he could not have met Truss in person today.This may buy Truss a bit more time, but it's not obvious why Hunt would take the job now since he clearly won't have a good time and has already served in important cabinet positions (health sec, foreign sec) so this wouldn't necessarily be his last chance to make it back into cabinet if Truss was removed. On the other hand, if he expects Truss to be removed, managing to bring a bit of stability could earn him some brownie points in an upcoming leadership campaign or guarantee him a place as chancellor in a possible Sunak government."
