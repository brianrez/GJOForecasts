Even if they start growing tomorrow with a doubling rate for # cases/day of 20 days, analogous to last fall, we'll barely get to about 152.6k total. But this is a more pleasant time of year for being outside in Texas; more people go indoors for air conditioning in the summer. Cases increased in the Southwest last summer. So I suspect we won't see quite so much growth by the end of April. But it's on the edge."

In the fall, doubling time for cases/day was about 3.5 weeks. I would expect at most similar case growth now because of the combined effects of both strong downward forces (seasonality, natural immunity, vaccination) and strong upward forces (the state opening up, more risky behavior following vaccination, and B.1.1.7, which is expected to become dominant in Texas over the coming weeks). If cases start increasing now like they did in the fall (or as they declined in the spring), confirmed + probable cases will be at ~6k/day by Around April 21, ~7.5k by end of April. I would expect this to be an approximate upper bound. Such a scenario would put the number of cases between 150k and 250k. I expect cases to start growing soon in Texas, in line with the experiences of other states as B.1.1.7 becomes dominant. Note that the State of Texas website numbers are *very* different from numbers available from other sources."

Figure actual cases ~4 * 2.76M = ~11M = ~38%. To date, ~22.3% of Texas population has received at least one dose of vaccine. So ~50% have some immunity (expected overlap between vaccinated and previously infected); ballpark 60% may have ~90% immunity by end of April, some small percentage with only one dose vaccine. Few cases last April. Nicer weather in April than in summer; many people may be outside. But, Texas is completely ""open."" It's been open for 12 days. And B.1.1.7 is likely to become the dominant strain in Texas by the end of March (https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/uk-variant-set-to-become-dominant-variant-in-texas-us-by-end-of-march), although the vaccines are largely effective against B.1.1.7. Currently, curve (cases/day) is almost flat and at ~4k cases/day. Based on fall rise, average cases/day not likely to rise to more than ~6.5k cases/day, although greater levels are possible with B.1.1.7. To have 150k cases in 30 days: 5k cases/day average. 250k: 8.3k cases/day 350k: 11.7k cases/day So: if cases stay relatively flat, then April will have <150k cases. If cases start to increase a bit, April will have 150k to 250k cases. Cases would have to increase massively to have 250k to 350k cases. I don't think that's likely to happen given immunity levels and seasonality, even with the state completely ""open"" and B.1.1.7. Some modeling for part of the state: https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/covid-19/assets/modeling.pdf Rt in Texas: https://covidestim.org/us/TX Rt in Texas currently est. 0.51, albeit with a wide margin of error. Based on other graphs I've seen, I'd say it's closer to 0.9. Even if it's 0.95 now, Rt won't exceed ~1.45 in April (worst case scenario). The 7 day moving average of cases/day has been <5k since March 10, but we're right up against the edge of that forecast bin. But if half moving to 90% of cases are B.1.1.7 in Texas in April, cases may increase more quickly. If cases/day at 4k/day at beginning of April, roughly speaking, would have to get above 6k/day by end of April to exceed 150k total cases. That wouldn't be too hard; greater drops and rises happened last summer and early fall. So, it's a tough call, but I think given B.1.1.7's contagiousness and Texas' openness, a bit of an uptick in cases can be anticipated primarily among the unvaccinated and those who haven't had Covid yet, as has been seen in other countries earlier."

This question wouldn't need to be asked had there been strict adherence to and adoption of mask wearing and social distancing promoted by senior government officials from the outset. Vaccination rates are improving across the board; however, there is a multi-week lag between receiving the first dose and second dose and a subsequent two week lag before the second dose max efficacy is achieved. Variant B.1.1.7 (U.K.) infections are currently being confirmed as an increasing percentage of new infections and have been detected in over 50% of Houston area wastewater treatment samples as of early February. Although the rate of new infections is trending downward Texas appears to be preemptively seizing defeat from the jaws of victory by removing restrictions on public health and safety measures before the virus has truly been stamped out from circulating populations. While infections may rise before ultimately falling to near zero once the vast majority of the population has been vaccinated, fatalities should continue to decline as once overburdened healthcare facilities and beleaguered front line health care workers are more effectively able to treat seriously ill COVID patients following the winter surge."
