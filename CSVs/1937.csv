Vote of no-confidence tabled for Nov 10: http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-11-03-explainer-misconceptions-about-a-no-confidence-vote/#.WB53yNR97iw It's the third this year, and as the vote will be open rather than secret there's no great confidence that Zuma will be asked to resign. However, ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu's call for the entire NEC to step down is resounding: https://www.enca.com/south-africa/anc-nec-called-to-resign If Gordhan supporter CyrilRamaphosa can be emboldened to vote against his boss - possibly a good political move - this could be a done deal. Assuming, though, that the no-confidence motion fails, the next week or two may decide this question one way or another. The next step is a judicial inquiry scheduled for early December, during which a lot of dirty laundry will be aired. It's just possible that more than a few stalwarts may see this as cancerous for the ANC and quietly urge Zuma to resign with what's left of his dignity."

I have been following the situation there, but have not been trying to estimate the odds before now. There are many factors to consider, but the timing is very important to me. There is no momentum to remove Zuma right now, despite the many problems (falling Rand, uni student protests demanding free education, minimum wage debates, unrest leading to vandalism, etc). The most volatile part of the situation is his problems working with Gordhan. If he does force Gordhan out before Jan '17 then this could be enough tension (via the impact on the Rand and state borrowing costs) to push the ANC to act. Everything in SA takes much longer than you expect, though, so it seems very unlikely to be possible before the end of 2016."

It seems to me that given the recalcitrant nature of Zuma, either a split within the ANC ruling body (a renegade group) or wholesale withdrawal of cooperation with the ANC by society generally (grinding the economy to halt) are the two most effective strategies to remove Zuma. Left up to himself, Zuma will not resign, the ANC leadership will also not spontaneously offer up a mea culpa and resign; and any proposal that calls for such is more of a hindrance than a help to the goal of removing Zuma. To date, there are no ANC leadership renegades (or any bloc of such renegades) nor is there any news of general civil strikes or other manifestations of withdrawal of support intended to force the issue to a short term resolution. http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/the-seven-sins-the-anc-must-fix-to-survive-20160924"
