With second quarter sales numbers in, the sales are already 387 million. To hit the target, second half sales would need to be 364 million or better. We know that sales won't keep up with last year in the second half (my strong assumption that we won't see another 424 million sales), but it seems unlikely that second half sales will fall below 2019 numbers (380 million). I expect third quarter numbers to be around 160 million. If it's above that, I'll move up. If it's lower, I'll need to reevaluate."

96755,2021-05-12T19:48:11Z,1,[80.0],[80.0],"The growth in the sale of print books in 2020 seems largely due to the pandemic (as stated in articles written about the NPD article linked in the question, source 1). Further, NPD statistics seem to have been led by juvenile fiction, juvenile non-fiction, and adult non-fiction in real terms. However, the growth in adult categories of books was much smaller than juvenile categories in percentage terms. Extrapolating the overall intent of many book purchases seems to be to provide juveniles with something to occupy their time when no longer in school in person and to provide an outlet for adults to better themselves during the pandemic outside of work. If in-person work and school returns across the US in 2021 the overall sales of juvenile books and adult non-fiction will probably not be as robust as in 2020. This does not look likely broadly across the US until the fall. That means three quarters which will probably robust sales of print books at a minimum, which was also the case in 2020 as only three quarters saw strong print book sales in 2020. Therefore, book sales will probably continue to be strong, as was seen in the first quarter of 2021 (source 2)."

Q1 2021 saw the growth from Q4 2020 continue (3) Whats going to be interesting is how long the Covid measures will stay in place and what will happen with books sales when they are scaled back. My expectation is that books sales will see little growth when measure are lifted and people start going out. When this will happen will be a big influence on book sales growth. If life returns to normal at the start of Q3 or earlier books sales will likely not be greater than 2020. If measures are lifted in Q3 there is a change book sales will increase. Given the current vaccination drive 70% vaccination rate should be achieved at the end of august. (4) Also interesting to see is how reading habits have changed. Juvenile books where the top performers of 2020, if a lot of kids can keep the reading habit this could cause a surprise sales lift even when restrictions are lifted."

The cost of procuring materials for books has to be related to the supply of the wood somehow... not sure yet, but to me if wood is more expensive, that cost is going to be passed on to the consumer. So, even if there are more produced, costs could prove prohibitive in a relative sense of book purchasing. Want to look more in to the correlation as related to physical book production..."
