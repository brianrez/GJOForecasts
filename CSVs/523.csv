It's now going on long enough that it seems to me that the current decline is likely not just ""noise"" on the way up. However, I still firmly believe that Brazil will see >19.0M cases by July 31 because the peak respiratory virus season is approximately from now through the end of July, there is no concerted national effort to stem transmission, and vaccination is proceeding slowly and primarily with a vaccine that has been found to be 50% effective at preventing cases in Brazil. It is as inconceivable to me that there will not be a winter peak in cases of a respiratory virus in Brazil as it was that the US would not see an increase in cases last fall and winter. Spreading in fall, winter and spring is what respiratory viruses do. Even if cases continue to decline a bit more, I am confident that they will be heading back up within the forecast period. There are 4.22M cases to go to reach 19.0M, and 89 days remaining in the forecast period; it will take an average of 47.4k cases/day to reach 19M, and Brazil is currently at a 7-day average of 58.6k cases/day."

Additionally, will the Brazilian government get serious about putting COVID restrictions in place (probably not) or will the citizens take a more proactive approach to protect themselves (possibly, but probably with limited impact). I am modifying my forecast slightly, based on the likelihood that while conditions in Brazil will remain pretty bad, the county has probably seen the worse and COVID cases will begin to decline.

Knowing that individual day results were deceptive, I used a 7- day average. 107*75349+ 13 677 564 (cases to date)=21 739 907. My previous result was based on a 60 day window. How embarrassing. That being said, immunizations will bring the result down. At some point, the Brazilian strain will run out of people to infect in the North. The question is: how soon will it be under control in the south? (probably not soon, I would imagine?) From these points, @belikewater makes some excellent points. Yes, we will quite likely see >20M cases by then. ~3M spare, assuming the vaccine makes a meaningful difference."

At current rate an addtional 21.6% of the population will be vaccinated by July 31 (Total 26.1%). P.1 Strain is well on its way to being the dominant strain in Brazil, is 1.4-2.2 times more contagious, 25-61% more capable of re-infection, and evidence points to the SinoVac Vaccine being ineffective against it (which accounts for ~70% of vaccinations). If the SinoVac vaccine is ineffective, and the other vaccines are ~95% effective, as of July 31 effectively 5% of the population (11 million) will be immune via vaccination. 12 million have been infected meaning ~23 million (~11%) are effectively immune. If trend continues ~17M additional cases could occur, assume less 12% due to vaccination putting the high end total at ~25M. If the vaccine is 100% effective the infection rate should also drop, so 40% less than high estimate, meaning 10M new infections for 21.7M total. There are currently no restrictions in place and even an extreme lockdown is unlikely to change the outlook in the next 2-4 weeks. Although infection has proven not linear it seems likely an ongoing rapid increase in infections will be followed by a later decrease but should even out over the given timeframe. The new health minister seems unlikely to impose a lockdown currently. More aggressive measures seem possible but unlikely in the near term (2-4 weeks) and better vaccine procurement is in process, so it seems most likely it will be over 19M cases."
