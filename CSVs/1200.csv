Korea and Taiwan are highly dependent on automation and electronics groups selling into the USA so sensitive to any new US tariffs, while Korea also has major logistics companies shipping stuff from China. Singapore is a small index for companies wanting an offshore jurisdiction in Asia (the country itself only has 6 million people). The Hang Seng benefits from being the 'offshore' for big PRC companies and some Taiwanese groups that don't want to list in Taipei (which is very small).
