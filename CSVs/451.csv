Expect an increase in consumer and business confidence with expected gdp increases which could lead to more investment in rigs. $US is lowest in 5 years which will give confidence to exporters leading to local production. OPEC expects strong growth but major players (Saudis) have stated that they will wait and see the demand before they risk a production increase. This may lead to US producers bringing wells online faster (3 month end of range rather than 6) as the price per barrel continues to increase. US covid is in good position but some OPEC nations could be in trouble with low vaccination and potential for outbreaks and risks to production. Lack of international flights could mean more local driving holidays and a higher demand than the pessimistic EIA forecasts. Will be interesting to check trends in 1 month. Very cognisant that my forecast is higher than crowd. Will need to read more of others justifications and update for counter evidence."

OPEC won the war and the money backing US shale production walked away. They ain't coming back. Even if oil spikes to $100 they ain't coming back because OPEC+ will turn on the taps faster than new equipment can get out to the permian basin.
