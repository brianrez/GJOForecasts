The Oligarchs of Russian society have a significant amount of influence, and as there are protests and increasing critiques of Putin from the populous, I think Putin will look for ways to decrease the number of individuals who could wield any level of influence / power over his actions. The interesting thing is that the US Treasury just released a list of the most prominent Russian ""Oligarchs"" with connections to Putin, which might put increased pressure on Putin to pull back on any rapid, significant changes he would want to make. Because of this, the percentages I give are - 43% 0-1 leaders removed; 48% 2-3 leaders removed; 8% chance of 4-5 leaders being removed and 1% chance of 6-7 leaders being removed.
