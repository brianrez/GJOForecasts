Considering that there are no major holidays in October that people would travel for, and that not many people take vacations in October, as those are reserved for the summer months, there is likely very little fluctuation from the baseline. In addition, in most places, October is a very reasonable time of year weather wise. In the the weather is cooling down everywhere but it is not too hot and not too cold. Therefore, there is a likelihood of less travel for that reason too. Rates of travel have gone up significantly in the past year because people are feeling more comfortable with Covid-19 and they became impatient sitting in their home.

My question would be how correlated are the number of full-time employees and number of persons traveling through TSA. I'm not adept at figuring this correlation out. My guess is that even though less full-time employees could mean more layoffs and thus more travel through TSA, the opposite could be argued in that the more there are full-time employees, the more money there is in the economy for people to spend on travel and vacation."

Most likely a slight increase to perhaps 92-95% = 66.4-69.3M with some caution on levels dropping. Need to check what factors affect travel in October in particular to refine this one.
