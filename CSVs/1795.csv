The US needs Israel as a strong ally in the middle east regardless of human rights violations which occur regularly. Also, the US has 5 of the top 10 Jewish populated cities in the world and the majority of Jews are Zionists. The Zionist lobby is very strong in Washington. President Trump has tasked Jared Kushner with solving the problem. Unless Israel grows new land or Egypt is willing to change its borders, the Palestinians and Jews in Israel will stay in a constant state of unrest that causes regular violence. In my opinion, rather than assigning anyone with the task of solving the problem, we leave Israel alone and occasionally scold them when their human rights abuses become too egregious. I know my point of view is isolationist and cold, but the US is comfortable with these type allies. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is officially Wahabi Muslim and is first in persons beheaded in a UN recognized country."

On the other hand: Trump needs a win, and even a picture of Netanyahu and Abbas in the same room would count as one. And Netanyahu might choose not to disappoint Trump."

Israel has refused to attend (though the president of the Palestinian Authority will be there), arguing that only direct talks, not multilateral ones, can solve the issue. Participants will reaffirm their own commitment to the two-state solution, will call on the Israeli and Palestinian governments to disassociate themselves from those (including members of Israel’s ruling coalition) who reject it, and will dangle some economic and political incentives to encourage progress.

At this moment they have cope with the fact, that most countries in their neighbourhood were once relatively stable gouvernments, now they are in turmoil and nobody has a clue about the outcome. In Russia is an institutionalysed mob in control, in the US you have a psychriatic case after this presidential election. Which more or less makes the world around the Palestinian Israëli conflict. You simply cannot fight in peace, when everybody and everyting around you is trying to suck you in an abyss, which could lead to total annilation of both conflictpartners.
