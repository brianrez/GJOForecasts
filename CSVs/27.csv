The General Staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said Wednesday morning that Russian forces continued to focus their efforts on “conducting offensive operations” in the area around Bakhmut.It’s not the first time that Pushilin has claimed that Bakhmut is close to encirclement, having said the same thing last week. Ukraine vehemently denies it is even close to being semi-encircled, with one official telling CNBC that Russia is seeing masses of personnel losses in the area, and little gains, although the official admitted the fighting was intense.— Holly Ellyatt"

RU has been making slow progress, the trajectory of which may change with the end of fighting in Kherson. I suspect UA will continue to defend hard but perhaps not at the expense of preparing for attacks on the more important regions to the north or south."

I suppose if the Russians were able to get a large amount of hardware out of Kherson, are able to transfer it hundreds of kilometers during the winter, and decide they have no better place to use it, some of it might wind up on the Bakhmut front and make a difference. I just don't see any of that actually happening."
