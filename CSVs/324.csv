The PRC has been laying the groundwork for this for several years, and their recent actions indebting African countries to them (especially Zimbabwe) indicates that they are most likely reaching the grounds to make such an agreement now or in the very near future. Especially with focus on Ukraine and their aggression regarding Taiwan, it is likely that such an agreement would not garner much public attention. This would probably be to the liking of the PRC, as they have kept their developments in Africa, even their base in Djibouti, out of the limelight as well. This seems to be the perfect time for such an agreement to be established, and it would also appear that the PRC has the means to do so."

So, this suggests South of Bata #2 (1.806908 9.741987) because the North is full of civilians. They wouldn't pick a civilian area for a mil installation, yet won't move too far away. Djibouti's is as large as the current civilian port of Bata #1; in other words, if the civilian port remains, another such massive installation would be needed.I also used https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/ with 1km radius circle to compare the sites. USGS looks like BING.By the way, you can use 赤道几内亚 巴塔 港 to search for Chinese pages or images.Opinion 2: There is a lot of banter. Since the Chinese can build faster and larger than Tesla, and last time the first reports appeared one year ahead of the finalization, I would expect actual evidence rather than rumors about talks. As of May 2022, I've only found rumors."

Another real possibility is in Tangier, Morocco. ""The Chinese presence in Morocco and Egypt, meanwhile, is concentrated in industrial zones, free trade zones, and financial centers. In Morocco, these include the Atlantic Free Zone in Kenitra, Casablanca Finance City (CFC), and the Tanger Med Port Complex. At the latter port complex, Chinese companies, including telecommunications giant Huawei, are planning to establish regional logistics centers."" (https://www.brookings.edu/research/beijing-calling-assessing-chinas-growing-footprint-in-north-africa/) PLAN presence in Tangiers would permit China to monitor everything coming and going through the Strait of Gibraltar and a strong economic foothold in Western Africa.

Something that could stop this would be public opinion or discontent with Chinese initiatives."

If no change in leadership, then demonstrations of consolidation of domestic power are likely first, so I would suspect such announcements not until after closing this question. If change in leadership, not opening new bases might be used as bargaining chip for re-integration of supply-chains, with same result."

It's nice to have redundancy on a single coast, but when it's your first base far from home, ensuring that one is squared away probably takes priority over negotiating a second one. And for China, diversity of regional influence may be far preferable. There is also the UAE - not technically in Africa, but somewhat in the same region - with whom China has larger trade and whose geography enables a new node of access to the Persian gulf. The Economist's Intelligence Unit predicts UAE will be relatively politically stable in the 2022-26 period. UAE/PRC relations have warmed through a ""comprehensive strategic partnership"". With regards to the Mid-East more broadly relative to Africa, NDU published in early 2020 that ""Beyond Asia, it is clear that the PLA’s initial area of focus is securing the SLOCs [Strategic Sea Lines of Communication] from the Middle East through the Indian Ocean that provide the majority of China’s energy imports and maritime commerce""."
