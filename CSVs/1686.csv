While there may be resistance in the USA to requiring social media sites to be held responsible for their content, other countries (especially countries where the social media sites pay little tax and employ few people ) are likely to demand that similar rules are applied to social media as those applied to print media. This will would mean the social media sites would have to pay out large sums of money in fines or damages if they ""publish"" things such as fake news (and all types or other matter that is considered illegal in that country). The cost of ensuring that Twitter complies with the laws of all countries is likely to be higher than the revenue it can earn. In many ways online media is just following a similar path to other new media; first it spreads information free from control, then the authorities (and some citizens) realise that ""free speech"" needs be controlled. The only real argument is how much ""freedom"" and how much ""control"" is appropriate."

Almost every week there are demands that social media companies must remove links to terrorist sites, remove hate speech, remove links to copyright material, remove fake news, remove content that some group believes it anti-social for some reason. In other words demands that social media companies are treated in a similar way to publishers. In many respects this is to be expected as most types of new media are, in their early days, accused of disturbing society. Eventually laws are enacted to control the perceived abuses as society navigates it way between freedom of expression and censorship. The difference with today's social media is that the scale of posts will make it very expensive for the sites to use people to judge if complainants have good cause to demand removal of offending posts . Eventually AI may be able provide editorial oversight. In the meantime governments that prioritize the rights of those who think they are being damaged by illegal content will not be very interested in how difficultly or expensive it is for the social media sites to control user content, and will fine the social media sites until they comply with new contend laws. Obviously I do not know what the social media sites will do about it (e.g. they may be forced to ""know your customers"" so that the authorities can prosecute the users who post illegal material, or so that they can be sued by wronged people, or the social media sites may need the means of banning users that do not follow the rules, the social media may need to block different posts in different legal jurisdictions.) But it seems pretty certain that many governments are going to crack down on the social media. In my view this is going to greatly change the business model of social media companies and Twitter seems to me to be particularly at risk. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-socialmedia-eu-consumersconsumers-idUSKBN16N2YI"
