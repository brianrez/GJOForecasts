Both sides have announced certain preconditions that seem to be mutually exclusive: Iran wants the initiative to come from the US by lifting all economic sanctions, and the latter calls for an immediate stop to uranium enrichment in Iran to lift the sanctions. Moreover, Iran currently experiences high tensions on its northern borders with Azerbaijan where it has multimillion Azeri population. Iran has deployed heavy military arsenal and warned that it would not tolerate any attack on its sovereignty. Making compromises in other international directions would undermine Raisi's domestic reputation as a hardline actor. The Biden administration has already mentioned more than once that they are ready to discuss JCPOA revival, but they have not received any substantive offers. They see their announcement of rejoining JCPOA as a main compromise to Iran. Taking into account the withdrawal from Afghanistan, the administration is unlikely to demonstrate much more detached position in this part of the Middle East. Even some European partners seem to be more flexible on this question, but their position had little effect on the US position. If you add to this equation Israel's hardened posture, everything becomes more puzzled. Recent developments in the US-Russia relations in terms of closing the Russian representation in NATO also demonstrates that the US currently is constrained in its eastern policies. I think when two states come from directly opposite political blocks with some turbulent political background, it is vital to lay a basis to recover the trust and willingness to understand each other's concerns. Once there is progress on this matter, anything else becomes technicality."

Not only has the Iranian Foreign Minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, indicated JCPOA would not be a possibility during his tenure, the JCPOA is not a priority issue for the new president, Ebrahim Raisi. (https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/10/07/iran-deal-talks-jcpoa-vienna-nuclear-negotiations-raisi/#) Also, as Iran continues to enrich uranium, the JCPOA is simply loosing relevance as Iran moves past the terms set by the JCPOA. Iran is also reluctant to trust the U.S. again and is skeptical that the U.S. will lift the current sanctions. (https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/09/22/separate-nuclear-iran-deal-jcpoa-regional-security-saudi-arabia-uae/) Both parties have to want and need the deal.

By ruthlessly engineering the election of a hard-liner’s hard-liner to the presidency, Mr. Khamenei has slammed the door on normalization and nailed it shut. > That’s only one of the problems afflicting the JCPOA. Instead of welcoming the Biden administration’s eagerness to return to President Obama’s Iran policy, Tehran has turned up its nose at American attempts to chart a course back to mutual compliance with the terms of the deal. The ease with which President Trump was able to dump the JCPOA, and the inability of outraged Europeans to contest his imposition of unilateral sanctions, created a healthy skepticism in Iran about the deal’s value. Tehran has realized that an executive agreement like the JCPOA has no legal force in the U.S. It is not simply that a future president could follow Mr. Trump’s footsteps and reject the nuclear deal. President Biden could sign the JCPOA one week and reimpose American sanctions on whatever grounds he chose the next, and Iran would have no recourse. > Rather than seeing American withdrawals from Afghanistan and Iraq as friendly gestures meriting a constructive response, the mullahs appear to have interpreted them as a sign that the Biden administration can be safely defied. Likely believing the White House is bent on Middle East withdrawal, no matter the cost, Tehran seems to have decided to double down on its confrontational approach to capitalize on perceived U.S. weakness. > A deepening confrontation with a radicalizing Iran is not what the Biden administration expected from its Middle East policy, but that is the reality with which it must cope. Attempting to placate Tehran through patience and restraint will likely only stoke the regime’s ambitions. The smell of blood in the water rarely inspires feelings of moderation and restraint among sharks."

US has internal pressures to link JCPOA with a broader agreement with Iran that addressed the Iranian missile ballistic program and it support to proxies in the Middle East, making discussions more complex.

My point was that Iran and Iranian leaders tend to have a much longer time horizon than do Western democracies with comparatively frequent and meaningful elections. The clerical Iranian leaders likely see no dissonance between this shocking breach of international law (in my earlier post about Iranian intelligence seeking to kidnap an American on U.S. soil) and their continued, slow, painful negotiations in Geneva. The current grouping of states seeking to subvert the post-World War II rules-based International Order (China, Russia, North Korea, Iran) all engage in these so-called “salami-slicing” tactics, to which I did not give adequate weight. I was previously well above the crowd (80%) and this event caused me to reevaluate my excessive optimism for a resolution within our question’s timeframe. I agree they very well may come to agreement, but I am just not as optimistic as I was that it would be in time for a “yes” on our question."

However, domestic and external factors may delay when the U.S. can rejoin the JCPOA. I don't think that the domestic politics in either country (i.e. Republicans v. Democrats or the upcoming Iranian Presidential elections) will play too heavy of a role. In Iran, Khamenei pretty much holds all of the power when it comes to foreign policy. With talks continuing to happen, it's generally a good sign he is interested in striking a deal for moving forward. I don't see the upcoming presidential elections having a significant impact on the outcomes of the talks and the U.S.' ability to rejoin the deal. In the U.S., the Biden administration currently has the support of Congress, and it will be important to have as many political wins before the Congressional 2022 elections. However, as time goes on, and depending on the success of the next round of more controversial domestic bills being introduced, the current administration may lose some support in Congress, but again, I don't think this will have a significant impact on that 1 January deadline. What I think will really matter in the next few months will be the influence of third-party nations to the discussions, especially Israel. Israel is suspected to have carried out cyberattacks on a nuclear facility in Natanz. Any other actions to the same degree or greater as those suspected by Israelis in Natanz will most certainly put in jeopardy the U.S.' ability to reenter the JCPOA by 1 January 2022 since Israel is a historically close ally in the region."
88452,2021-05-09T09:34:30Z,8,[100.0],[0.0],"""With the Iranian elections approaching in June, the nuclear talks are more important than ever. If one current leader, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, can successfully renegotiate a deal, it is likely that he will gain more support before the election but to do so, while strengthening the image of his preferred candidate. Yet, to accomplish this Iran will need to compromise quite a bit. The current (former reformist) president Hassan Rouhani and his (moderate) opponent Hassan Ruhani are the two main candidates for this election. The successful completion of the Iran nuclear deal before June could help support Ruhani in his election campaign, but an unsuccessful completion of the deal could work in Ruhani’s favor. Thus, whoever becomes the next president will also have a large influence on Iran’s relationship with the United States. Overall, the Iran nuclear deal will have greater implications than just restricting Iran’s nuclear development; it will truly change the course of the relationship between the United States and Iran for better or for worse."" https://globaledge.msu.edu/blog/post/57011/iran-nuclear-deal"

For one, there are upcoming elections in Iran with which Rouhani will be replaced, possibly and historically by a rather conservative leader who may hold hostile views towards the United States, which also leads the Iranian government to not potentially want to rejoin this controversial agreement so close to an election. Also, the agreement was not perfect beforehand, so I also think that if a deal were to happen, it would be a new deal, not the JCPOA."

There appears to be a lot growing optimism that the U.S. will rejoin the JCPOA, but the real question is, is the JCPOA the top foreign policy in the Middle East for the Biden Administration right now? Additionally, the instability in the Israeli government has got to be a consideration in the decision. In my opinion, the Biden Administration does want to rejoin the JCPOA, but sees a number of political pitfalls in doing so, at least with out some significant concessions from Iran, which I do not believe they are willing to provide. I am inching toward 50/50 on this question, in part because there is still about eight months left in the year, which leans towards the likelihood that there will be a breakthrough. However, I am not as optimistic as the news that has been emerging out of Europe over the past week regarding the JCPOA."

The real questions here is how committed is Iran to the agreement and do they really have the ability/compacity to refine enough uranium for a nuclear bomb if they want to? While Iran has a highly educated society and capable scientists, do the they have the resources and/or the real desire to have a nuclear bomb? For example, despite being an oil rich country, energy prices in Iran are extremely high in comparison to other countries in the region. This could make an argument for and against domestic nuclear energy. On one hand the capital investment required to build a domestic nuclear reactor is in the billions (just look at the current nuclear power plant being built in Georgia, which is being delayed and at least a billion over budget). On the other hand, once up and running, domestic nuclear energy is fairly cheap. Bottom line, is domestic nuclear energy really the best course for Iran or do they really desire to have at least the ability to build a nuclear bomb? It would seem to be the latter. The Biden Administration clearly wants to rejoin the agreement, but with concessions, which Iran does not appear to be inclined to agree to. What is the breaking point for the Biden Administration? Iran? A lot more information is needed in order to attempt to make an accurate prediction. Any suggested additional information is always greatly appreciated. Additionally, the formation of the new Israeli government will have an impact on if the U.S. officially rejoins the JCPOA.

96755,2021-02-22T16:55:35Z,1,[90.0],[90.0],"The US seems likely to rejoin the JCPOA because the US lacks a more efficient incentive structure to curb Iranian enrichment programs even with the threat or use of military force and President Biden has consistently stated he would rejoin the deal with Iran in some fashion. Thus, JCPOA remains the most convenient and effective way to bargain with Iran. (see first and second linked sources below). The main reason a rejoining of the deal is not assured is that ""hawks"" in Iran, and the US (and Israel) seem to be opposed to any deal with one another. As the Iranian government is largely unchanged since the original deal and the new US administration is committed to a deal in some fashion the ""hawks"" seem unlikely to sway the more moderate governing coalitions in both Iran and the US. Biden seems highly incentivized to make a deal happen before Iranian or Israeli elections. (see third linked source below). Very high likelihood of a deal in some fashion that is branded as under the auspices of the JPCOA in the next 11 months."
25163,2021-02-22T16:48:34Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],"It is the declared intent of all leaders and officials of all the governments party to the agreement. None of whom supported Trump's rationale for withdrawal. So I'm taking that at face value. The Western parties all considered the JCPOA a ""win"" and it seems nothing has changed their opinion. For Iran, sanctions relief would provide very material and substantial economic benefits. Iran was happy to comply with the terms of the JCPOA. So it seems there is little of substance to stand in the way of US rejoining. Current frictions over ""who moves first"" seem minor and solveable in comparison to the benefits both Iran and US perceive in rejoining. My estimate would drop a lot if the US made clear that it will not rejoin the JCPOA unless Iran first officially to agrees to immediately start negotiations on a larger regional deal."

Considering inflation you can get Iranian oil out of the ground for 10 USD bucket. A deal with Iran should be more direct and transparent.

Their is already a logistics plan and process for delivering Iran oil and gas to Europe and abroad. The other issue is where will the financial transactions take place? Just invite them to the DTCC table have some of the local families just explain why and how etc etc. cultural accommodations can probably be made. Baby steps. Russia can be contained.

The Biden administration would like to extend the present JCPOA agreement to include the restriction of Iran’s missile program with its potential for a nuclear head delivery system that it sees as its principle defence deterrent. Iran considers the large military expenditures by its neighbours and would require reciprocity in order to agree to concessions. Also, the sanctions do have an effect where unemployment and inflation are high; They are running out of foreign exchange On Thursday 18th February the Biden administration stated that it was ready to hold talks with other world powers and Iran to discuss Iran’s nuclear program as first step to reengaging with the 2015 agreement."
