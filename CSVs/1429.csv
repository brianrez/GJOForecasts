"Between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2018, will an armed group from Yemen engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Yemen?",2017-12-28T18:00:41Z,2018-04-01T06:59:41Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],362,654,185,237,"The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (Early Warning Project). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 31 March 2018 and will be resolved in January 2019 after EWP assesses the situation in Yemen from January 2018 through December 2018. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilian fatalities occur in one or more campaigns. See (Early Warning Project) for examples.

According to the Humanitarian Response Plan, as of December 2017, health facilities reported that Yemen had ""9,245 conflict related deaths and over 52,807 injuries – meaning that an average of 60 people have been killed or injured every day in the past two and a half years."" The report also included that in the academic school year of 2017-2018 21% of schools in Yemen are unfit for continue with teaching academics because of armed groups. According to Monica Duffy Toft. 2014. “Territory and War” Journal of Peace Research 51(2): 185-198, territory has been and will be a core issues in explaining the escalation of war/conflict. Though this is not about border lines - rather who is in control aligns with Toft's Bargaining and indivisibility theory saying that symbols matter (religious groups). October 8 was the last armed strike against civilians, led by the Saudi's that killed more than 100 people attending a funeral gathering in Sana’a. Yemen is politically unstable and actors will use force to progress any political change."
