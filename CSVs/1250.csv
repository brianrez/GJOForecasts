Hold on a minute though: this does not take responsibility into account, so maybe the AVS were never responsible and all we see is the rate of the drivers around them. So this answer depends on how many more AVs there will be on the road and how many miles they will drive. The evidence seems to say they are road ready already! However, if GM doubles their vehicles to prepare for a commercial ride hailing service, then crashes will double too. So, I'll go for such a doubling and say more than 115.

Partially because the question is not well defined and partially because it is not a static situation. The question does not state what Level of autonomy we are judging. There are 5 levels from something like enhanced cruise-control to fully autonomous. There is also the vagueness in the question regarding ""testing"" autonomous vehicles versus consumer autonomous vehicles. For example, there are no Level 5 consumer vehicles on the road, but there are several companies testing Level 5 vehicles on the roads in CA."

Miles driven: https://www.therobotreport.com/self-driving-cars-disengagements/ Waymo (Alphabet's self-driving venture) had by far the most miles driven in 2016 and 2017, -44% less miles driven in 2017 compared to 2016, though. It looks like many miles driven will shift to Phoenix, where they plan to roll out their first commercial autonomous ride service. (https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2018/03/02/waymo-is-millions-of-miles-ahead-in-robot-car-tests-does-it-need-a-billion-more/#627ab2311ef4) Nevertheless, other companies will continue to test and probably ramp up their mileage, although they might be discouraged by what seems like Waymo being way ahead of the curve here. But since the companies playing catch up are both large (GM, Nissan) and potentially a few smaller startups, I think it would be reasonable to assume that miles driven in CA will be higher. For this forecast I would go with 1 million miles driven in CA as the lower bound, 3 million miles driven as the upper bound. This could also go significantly higher if commercial operations involving autonomous cars start popping up, so will have to keep an eye out for that. One thing that might need clarification in this question: Will only accidents reported in vehicle testing be included or would the count include accidents by commercially and regularly operated fleets? Miles driven per accident reported: The PLoS One paper (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5607180/) cites 40-54k miles driven per accident for Google's vehicles, see Table 2. Other companies do much worse with 3k-20k miles driven per accident. A pessimistic outlook for this parameter would be: - no progress from Google/Waymo, so they would remain at ~50k miles driven per accident. - the rest of the pack manages to catch up to the best from the paper, so the rest has an accident every 20k miles driven. An optimistic outlook for this parameter would be: - Google/Waymo manages to beat the average of conventional cars in the US (500k miles/accident). Considering they want to launch a commercial service, they pretty much have to be measured by that standard in order to gain their customers' trust. - The rest catches up halfway, so 250k miles/accident. There is a fair chance they might get better even faster, as once a pioneer has led the way it's easier for competitors to follow, poach people who have know how from a project that succeeded, etc. This technology might be starting to take off exponentially, which is always hard to wrap one's head around in a forecast."
