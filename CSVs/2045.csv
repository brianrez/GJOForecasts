Will either of the following parties be part of the ruling coalition after Spain's upcoming elections?,2015-10-05T20:00:45Z,2016-05-03T19:00:48Z,Neither,"['Podemos', 'Ciudadanos', 'Both', 'Neither']",['Non-US Politics'],1673,654,261,237,"The anti-austerity leftist party, Podemos, and the reform minded centrist party, Cuidadanos, are hoping to capitalize on the steady erosion of support for Spain's primary political parties, Partido Popular (PP) and Partido Socialista Obrero EspaÃ±ol (PSOE) (Bloomberg, EconoTimes, CNBC). Elections are expected to be held on or before 20 December 2015. Updated on 2/22/16: The question on Spain's election has been reopened for forecasting as the parties are still working to put together a governing coalition. The end date will continue to be extended until a new governing coalition is formed or new elections are scheduled. Updated on 4/8/16: The question has been reopened. Negotiations on a power-sharing agreement are ongoing, and a new deadline of May 2nd has been set (Agence France-Presse via Yahoo!). The question will be suspended at 11:59pm Pacific on May 3rd in the absence of a new governing coalition, the scheduling of elections, or an extension of the negotiation deadline.",https://www.gjopen.com/questions/53-will-either-of-the-following-parties-be-part-of-the-ruling-coalition-after-spain-s-upcoming-elections

I see three possible options: 1) they give up and go to new elections (no ruling coalition)- 60 % 2) The PP now ask for their turn to form a government and try to make enough concessions so that Citizens and the Socialists will support a minority PP government with a limited and agreed agenda (no ruling coalition- only minority government). I don't see this happening unless the PP is willing to get rid of Rajoy and name someone else as a condition of PSOE abstention. 27% 3) Citizens asks for a turn to form a minority government with a limited and agreed agenda. In this case Citizens would be part of the ""ruling coalition"". The PP and PSOE may well support a Citizens government for their own reasons, particularly if the government would enact some measures that their supporters would like to see. However this is less likely (down from 20 percent to 13 percent) as the PSOE may be happy to have elections now while the PP is embroiled in corruption investigations and the PP may be happy to have elections after the PSOE failed to form a government after compromising with Citizens, which should increase Podemos support and also separatist party support (as PSOE was rejected by regional parties)."

Citizens has agreed an acceptable platform with the Socialists. This reduces the chances that Podemos is part of a formal coalition (I have already had them at 0% for some time) and is really a gambit to get the PP to abstain during the vote on government formation on March 5th. It puts the PP in a difficult position. They had declined the chance to form a government first as they felt it would fail and damage credibility and so wanted the Socialists to try first (and fail). All along the PP has favoured a unity minority government where the PSOE and C would informally support the PP on a limited set of reforms and new elections late in 2016. Instead it is now the Socialists who are trying to do exactly this with Sanchez as the leader. The PP need not vote for Sanchez- merely abstaining will get him in the door. However, I don't see the PP abstaining and I believe this effort will fail. That leaves four scenarios 1) no government, new elections in Spring 2) Rather than the PSOE trying to head a government, it is Ciudadanos that is given the final chance and they are able to form a temporary minority government with votes of PSOE and PP 3) the PP asks for a turn to form a government, but they depose Rajoy and appoint a new leader in return for an abstention by the PSOE or 4) The Socialists try to move left and re-attract Podemos into the mix (note it will be difficult to get the support of both Podemos and Ciudadanos)."

Funny that neither Rajoy nor Sanchez want to be the first one to make an attempt at forming a goverment and fail (as the failure only makes them look weak). The only workable solution is an interim minority government with a limited mandate (constitutional and corruption reforms among them) until new elections in the summer or fall. The voters and the President would like to see a grand coalition, but the PSOE is afraid that formerly associating with the PP will drive more PSOE supporters to Podemos. Ciudadanos seems willing to support a minority government (though so far not willing to enter into a formal coalition). However, there is talk that if/when both Rajoy and Sanchez fail to form a govt, the President may ask Rivera to take a turn (he might then lead a minority govt with tactical, issue by issue support from the PP and PSOE. This is still a long shot (I have only a 20 percent chance CUID is part of the ruling coalition), as I think the PP will get rid of Rajoy (and his departure might make a PP minority govt or grand coaltion with PSOE possible) before they will let their rival CUID take the PM slot. We may not get a resolution until February."

I give a 10% chance to this option . Podemos+Ciudadanos+PSOE would be only possible at the cost of breaking Podemos. The probability of Ciudadanos being in the government with PP is small. In such scenario they might prefer be aside and support PP in some votes. There is also a very small chance of a PP+Ciudadanos+PSOE government.

I'm a bit inclined to think that PSOE may work with PP and CUID, as Rajoy called for, due to their 4th place standing and the possibility of an alliance with CUID and smaller parties on some issues. Still, I'm overall pessimistic on these four groups playing nice. PP is looking for a first confidence vote before the end of January. Incremental adjustment."

Anyway, it looks like the PSOE has snubbed Podemos. The likely alternatives are a PP minority government for a limited term (elections later in 2016) that is supported by the PSOE and Ciudadanos for a very limited agenda, or a minority PSOE/Ciudadanos government for a limited term that is supported by Podemos, regional parties or the PP on certain issues."

I cannot imagine that the PP will be entirely left out of forming a new Govt, looking at their geographical strengths. However if so, i rather judge the likelihood for new elections bigger, than PP in the opposition. PP forming a coalition of 2 is possible, a stable coalition throughout the next election period will not be possible to form and case by case majorities have to be won with the specific compromises. In case PP has to give up to form a Govt, and the PSOE will be appointed to form a Govt., the likelihood seems to me even lower, since the differences to POD seems by now too big and also the differentiation capabilities of both against each other. PSOE with CIUD? i simply can't imagine as of now. Therefore I can think as of now of a variety of possible scenarios: a) PP+PSOE (similar to Germany's Govt. and a move to cope with the current ongoing eco crisis and the increasing tensions between the ""have"" and ""no- have"" in the society, but Spain has no culture of forming coalitions). b) PP and CUID which are in position much closer to each other, they can form a 43% together, but this only if Rajoy, is replaced as a leader of the PP (which is a very likely scenario after January's confidence vote. c) PP and POD, both options will not be sufficient to form a stable majority, and will depend on forming majorities case by case , as it was the case up to now. I give the coalition of PP+PSOE a better chance. both of the newcomers (POD and CIUD) in the Govt, I consider as very unlikely. d) PP and regional nationalists, seems a no-go. e) PSOE + POD + ERC complicated, i cannot imagine. http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21684827-fissiparous-electorate-makes-difficult-coalition-negotiations-chore-spanish http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/wahlen-spanien-entscheidet-sich-fuer-kompliziertes-regieren-a-1068919.html http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2016/01/01/actualidad/1451654649_759276.html"

Looks like there will either be a minority PP government (no coalition), or new elections or a minority PSOE government (supported by Podemos, the communists and the regional parties). A grand coalition (PP/PSOE) seems unlikely as that would cause more support to leak from the Socialists to Podemos. A formal PP coalition seems unlikely as I don't believe the regional parties needed to create a voting majority wish to align with the PP and C. A formal PSOE coalition seems unlikely as Podemos as neither party formally wants to align with the other. New elections may be needed, though an election in early 2016 might not change much from this outcome. Better to let a minority government rule until summer and hold the election then (or in the fall)."

I expected that minor parties will undergo the fizz that happened to MoDem or ToPotamos, but polls show the opposite. The Portuguese elections are somewhat suggestive to what we should expect. Even d'Hondt method of distribution is the same, muddying the numbers from the polls. The only difference is in Spain the four forces are at an arm's length. In Portugal, right-wing parties acknowledged their alliance before the elections, while the left-wing parties took an extremely long time to agree. Should the Portuguese socialists be more effective at alliance-forging, we would have had the equivalent of a POD + PSOE from start; instead, we saw the equivalent of PP + C's for a few days. In Spain the polls indicate even better scores for the second-tier parties (compare https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ElectionMonthlyAverageGraphPortugal2015.png to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:OpinionPollingSpainGeneralElection2015.png ) suggesting that it will be even more unlikely for either of the two main parties to govern alone. So I am giving the NONE option a very small chance. One one hand, the left binomial sums a bit higher than the right. On the other, the d'Hondt method favors the largest party, thus helping the PP+C's, where the smaller partner is less important. I am going out on a limb by thinking that d'Hondt-based redistribution will squash the 2-4% advantage the PSOE+POD have. In summary, I am revising up both ""one party"" options, and down ""none""."

POD seems to be doing surprising well and I believe they'll snatch 3rd, grabbing more seats and surpassing PSOE.

We wonât get married with a party that doesnât believe in change.â The issue of Catalan separatism, therefore, will loom large in any coalition agreement, and might mean that power-sharing with the PP, rather than the PSOE, is more likely. If a PP-Ciudadanos government comes to power, expect a showdown with Artur Mas and Catalan separatists.' This is how I see it.... 1) Rivera and Rajoy have similar views regarding Catalonia. 2) PP flexibility with centrist CUID would create an effective majority (> 176).

Neither PP (30%) or PSOE (25%) are polling near this, suggesting a coalition is maybe on the cards. However the polls are quite turbulent and EU wide have struggled for accuracy in recent years. There also seem to be a tendency for 'alternative' votes to disappear at the ballot box, however, I think this is a function of First Past the Post systems where people know protest votes are pointless. In PR systems there do seem to be more protest parties becoming involved in government. Even in the UK votes shares for UKIP and Greens were quite high and in a PR system would possibly have seen a Tory-UKIP coalition. It does seem PP are the most likely coalition forming party and they would not ally with POD (polling 15%), but CUID (polling 20%) seems plausible. PODs natural party would be PSOE who seem to be struggling. A rainbow coalition including both CUID and PODs seems unlikely."

In my view, there have been numerous references to CUID being the eventual 'kingmaker', having consistently polled 3rd in the past month. That view is tempered with what still appears to be a good # of undecided voters. The Spanish economy's upward trajectory, however slow and tenuous, should favor status quo, but the palpable national dissatisfaction with the current government call for some shift. I believe that gives CUID an advantage, being a relatively more conservative option. Affirming forecast."

While both Podemos and Ciudadanos have potential as 'young Turks', that still may not translate to a seat (or seats) at the [governing] table. Realistically, I see the PSOE (Socialist Workers Party) gaining more seats rather than Podemos getting any. Podemos's values seem to align strongly with Greece's Syriza Party and their performance so far in the handling of Greece's crisis has been pretty dismal. Of the two parties, Ciudadanos, with their 'reform-minded, centrist' platform may have a better chance in winning anything. I believe the Spanish people will opt for status quo."
