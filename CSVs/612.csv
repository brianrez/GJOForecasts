I am surprised HSBC has agreed particularly considering that the UK courts sided with HSBC. Although we do not know the extent of the agreement in smells to me though HSBC is either under pressure in HK or attempting appease China. I suspect the former. Will this apparent step forward in Meng's case in Canada be of any use to the two Michaels? I suspect there is more to this than meets the eye and there is the possibility of a backroom deal being put in place. In time for this question to resolve? Possibly though I am not convinced. All the necessary pieces have to be put in place and the US may well be reluctant to play ball. That said, Biden's administration may view this as an opportunity to appease Xi / China in some way after the rather terse meeting a few weeks ago. Equally, as France 24 notes (https://bit.ly/3tiplri) Meng's extradition trail is scheduled to end in mid-May, barring any appeals. Which is likely unless a backroom deal has been concluded. It's very possible IMO that the two Michaels' verdicts in their recent trail may be released around the time of the end of Meng's trial depending on the verdict in Canada. Or, shortly thereafter; https://bit.ly/3a72lEg. This article also highlights that Canada may simply be a bystander in the US v China battle for supremacy."

That may be the case, however, the most recent comments by Blinken and Austin (e.g. https://reut.rs/3vyNw6G) on their tour of Japan and S Korea are certainly not 'friendly' towards China. Hence, IMO, China is unlikely to ignore and brush off these comments. Certainly not as far as internal consumption is concerned. That begs two questions; a) is Canada's hope misplaced and b) why has China, apparently quite suddenly, announced a) the trial of the two Canadians is expected soon and b) almost 24 hours later announced the trial will start tomorrow and is schedule for 2 days? 2 days is an incredibly short time for what is (in western terms) a complex matter. Equally, China's courts have a notoriously high conviction rate. Particularly in matters such as this. See https://bit.ly/3tCvgqS.

Until Meng Wanzhou is released and returned, the same will not be done for Michael and Michael. As such I think the real prediction here is 'is there a settlement for the Meng trial prior to 15 July 2021' (with enough time afterward for her to arrive and China and then China to release them). Based on this article https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/10/huawei-cfo-meng-wanzhou-extradition-trial-explained.html there are three phases involved in the trial. One starting January 20th, a second one for June, and a third potential phase in September. The only way these protracted legal proceedings are avoided are that the judge sides with Meng AND there is no appeal, in the January proceedings (focused on double criminality standard) or June proceedings focused on due process during her arrest. The base rate for 'avoiding extradition from Canada to USA' is that 1% of people accomplish this. As such, I am going with a strong 90% probability that the Meng case is not fully sorted out by July 15th. Implicitly I am also assuming that the Biden administration does not choose to drop the charges in his first 5 months as president (to avoid looking 'soft on China'), or finding some other technicality which would result in her release and then the subsequent release of the Michaels. I am not a legal expert though."

But, since the base rate is the rock upon which estimates should be begin: The Spavor and Kovrig arrests follow a pattern of tit-for-tat arrests in China and Canada. Two Canadians were arrested in China following an arrest in Canada of Chinese nationals (for espionage against the US) in 2014 (https://bit.ly/3q0hRHq). The two Canadians that were arrested in China were sentenced to, and served, two years in prison. Prognosis: poor for Kovrig and Spavor."
