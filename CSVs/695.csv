I wonder between riots in the streets and every noticeable city in the states being on fire through one event or another how much outside direction or inspiration might actually be necessary. There are plenty of potential epicenters outside of the states as well which might make this an interesting breakout thread.

Of that list only 9/11 and I believe San Bernadino would count. San Bernadino is unclear though because according to wikipedia it sounds like they were inspired by foreign terrorist organizations but not directly connected to them in any way. I don't know how that would be judged. I'm going to subjectively go with 2% as there's a chance but it appears very small and a 1 in 50 year event sounds about right.
