"Between 1 July 2018 and 30 June 2019, will an armed group from Nigeria engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Nigeria?",2018-06-27T17:00:15Z,2018-10-01T06:59:15Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],96,654,43,237,"The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (The EWP). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 30 September 2018 and will be resolved in July 2019 after EWP assesses the situation in Nigeria from July 2018 to June 2019. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilians fatalities occur in one or more campaigns. See (EWP) for examples.

These are deliberate killings by an ethnic Fulani, Muslim militias that selectively target non-Fulani ethnic groups (such as Tiv and Bachama) who are also Christian. Many of the attacks are large scale and are launched against three, four, five, or more villages simultaneously. While the exact militia motivations and leaders are unknown, it does appear to be a systematic attempt to permanently remove non-Fulani, non-Muslim farmers from prime grazing land."

Genocide for the EWP is defined by Systematically killing of civilians Since the beginning of 2018, there have been more than 1300 people killed in the farmer herder conflict [1]. However, it's hard to tell whether that was organized or not (i'll update if there is more conclusive evidence if this is true later on). But worrying about the past really isn't what we are trying to do."

If the actual policy interest is in whether this sort of conflict will result in >1,000 civilian deaths, it's pretty much a gimme.

59732,2018-07-06T18:19:17Z,1,[35.0],[35.0],"The majority of deaths in Nigeria occur in Borno State. Although the Nigerian government indicates that Boko Haram have been neutralized, sources indicate that Boko Haram killed 900 people in 2017, slightly more than they did in 2016 (BBC), and the CFR report that Borno State had 1,940 deaths reported over the same period of time - July 2016 to June 2017 - last year (CFR). Since we do not know the nature of the deaths reported, i.e. whether a result of intentional civilian targeting, I have to assess my probability relatively low, while taking into account the indiscriminate terrorist attacks of Boko Haram that continue in highly civilian congested markets, towns, city centers and even IDP camps (such as in Maiduguri and Durumi IDP camp, July 2017 IDP camp attacks)."
