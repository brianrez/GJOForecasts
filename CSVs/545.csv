On the face of the situation, it would seem that Newsom is highly unlikely to be recalled. Current polling has only 40% of California supportive of recalling Newsom. That is higher than the 34.3% that Trump got in the state last year, which suggests that those supporting Newsom's recall are not just hardcore Republicans. This is important, because the last time a California Governor was recalled, Grey Davis, it was independent voters that really did him in. However, Newsom is not Davis. Newsom remains fairly popular among Democrats and most independents at the moment, while at the same point in the Davis recall, the Governor had an almost 2-to-1 disapproval rating. Additionally, California has become more Democratic and liberal since the Davis recall. Another factor in the Davis recall was the entry of Arnold Schwarzenegger as an alterative. I have not seen any data to support this, but I have to wonder if Schwarzenegger's entry into the race contributed or at least compounded the ultimate result of the recall of Governor Davis, which was 55.4% in favor. Would the percentage had been lower or could David have survived the recall if Schwarzenegger had not entered the race? The reason I raise this question is the recent announcement of Caitlyn Jenner as an alternative candidate to Newsom if he is recalled. Jenner certainly does not have name recognition nor the star power of Schwarzenegger, and her employment of Trump staffers and consultants will certainly be an issue that does not play well in California, but could it increase the likelihood that Newsom is recalled? I believe it remains unlikely that Newsom is recalled, but I am adjusting my forecast to account for the marginal probability that it does and other possible unforeseen factors."

Seems to be about a three week delay in reported gross signatures received by Recall Newsom group until recorded as submitted by the various counties. So the early March update should have about 1.5 million raw, 1.1 million verified, and low 900s validated. That will leave about two weeks for the recall people to get the rest of the signatures in. It’s just really hard to imagine with the ball rolling like it is that they won’t hit the goal. It will likely be sometime in April when enough signatures are validated."
