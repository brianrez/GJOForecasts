Similarly, @erikbays ' comment about the base rate of how often ""normal"" Supreme Court cases go to oral argument is only somewhat informative because of the highly unusual nature of the current situation (to wit: the importance of the election system overall, ongoing legal efforts to discard large numbers of votes in the current election (https://www.texastribune.org/2020/12/08/texas-ken-paxton-election-georgia/), attempts and rhetoric about how the supreme court *in particular* is the desired venue that the President appears to be hoping to use to further their current purposes (See POTUS retweet amplification of this message, for example: https://twitter.com/Raiklin/status/1336319381547089922 etc).

It will be ugly and historical and it needs doing from my perspective - mull this over - In order for this to make sense in what is going to really happen, Trump had to show you the steal first. The courts are not going to decide this election, the constitution will. With that said, since 2018, Trump signed an EO which gives him massive powers under a national security threat. The only department who can investigate this is military intelligence. Military intelligence watched the cheat go down live as it happened. Next, all those who participated in the steal, will be charged as treason. What court is used even for civilians accused of treason? Military court.

Importantly, while this is a very timely topic that could (and should) be prioritized if necessary, the collection of data required for making an oral argument is simply not going to be available in time (given the ongoing Senate race in Georgia as an example).
