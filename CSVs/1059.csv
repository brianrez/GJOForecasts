Pro-establishment candidates normally perform well at the district level, but this time pro-democracy politicians are expected to make considerable gains. That could unnerve Mrs Lam and the leadership in Beijing, since control of the 18 district councils could give the pro-democracy camp a bigger voice in Hong Kong’s legislature (six out of its 70 seats are reserved for councillors) and in the committee that chooses the chief executive (councillors make up nearly one-tenth of its 1,200 members). On November 12th the People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s main mouthpiece, said that holding “fair elections” would require “decisively” ending the riots. That seems a distant goal.”"

The current law keeps China out, but they can send troops as needed [3], though I wonder who would enforce that law right now if China violated it. Britain has plenty of their own problems to manage, the US seems to be running away from democratic complainants either to avoid issues or as a favor to those in the position of power, and there doesn't seem to be much of a unified coalition to oppose China moving in to preserve security and economic/social stability except through sanctions and diplomatic measures. Although China isn't in the strongest position now and they have been conservative about taking aggressive positions that they haven't prepared for well in advance and are generally well-prepared to handle, I think they would be more willing to move in before the protests lead to general chaos than to let them become a trigger or signal for something less manageable now or in the future. And China will want something that can be done behind the scenes or done without state violence, and do it quickly and efficiently. There have already been rumors and official clarifications of fatalities [4], and unless someone dies on the street in front of a camera, I wonder how clear the fatality outcome will be. I would expect a great many injuries, not many fatalities now that it's a real threat."

Fatalities obviously undermine that. Given growing news about Trumps impeachment and Brexit, they may just want to keep this off the front pages for the time being. There have been no fatalities so far, so it seems that those disciplining the protest are disciplined in that way. Of course, I am going on the assumption that suicides do not count as fatalities, as there have been 8 suicides so far. If suicides count, I would absolutely raise my prediction a large amount."
