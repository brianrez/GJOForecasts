It looks like the percent hospitalized (4.5%) and the length of stay (3.6 days) are lining up with the data out of South Africa and the UK. 12,317 were hospitalized Jan 11. And officially are forecasting that the worst is yet to come by a big margin. What I'm still wondering about is if the hospitalization peak will line up with what appears to be the case peak on Jan 3/4/5. Since we still have incomplete data the case load could still rise this week or, if this article (https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/omicron-headed-rapid-drop-us-britain-82206037) is correct, that could have been the peak, meaning hospitalizations should be near peak too (The UK seems to have peaked a week ago and is steady since.) @paulm pointed out the discrepancy in booster doses is likely a major help to the UK, especially given the low effectiveness of 2 doses... so there are a lot of complicating factors. Even if the current daily increase continues (~612/day over the last week) It could go up for 3 more days, then peak, and still not push the 14 day avg over 12k."

This will be some fuzzy logic but I'm putting it down and looking for feedback. Looking at the South Africa data the curve follows a ~5 week spike. If California follows a similar trend this should be week 3 in Cali and the highest infection numbers. South Africa's numbers in the peak week were ~20% higher than the previous week. If California follows a similar trend that would mean current hospitalizations should still come up 20-30% before peaking (week lag). Since they're at 9279 Jan 6, we should see peak numbers around the 12k mark and they'll stay there for a week. I think we're all confident it'll cross 12k at this point. But it's not the peak, its the average over 14 days. Even if it peaks at 15k it may not bring the 14 day average over 12k. I recall seeing an article that said public health officials were bracing for a 20k peak, which would certainly resolve this yes. The UK seems to be a week or so ahead and is showing signs of stabilizing (Their highest admissions in the last month was Dec 29). I'm still thinking it's more likely than not, but don't have the high confidence I had a few days ago."

Hospitalizations lag cases by approx 7-10 days, so estimating the number hospitalized as a fraction of cases 7 days ago will underestimate hospitalizations as a fraction of cases. So 5009/51.5 = 97.3 is an underestimate of hospitalizations per 1 case/100k population. 12000 / 97.3 = 123 cases per 100k population; thus, if CA sees 123 cases per 100k population, a 14-day average of 12k hospitalizations is all but assured. Moreover, in addition to this being an underestimate based on assuming 7 days between cases and hospitalizations, it's also likely an underestimate because cases to date have been skewed towards younger segments of the population. Because US cases are currently 1.6x last year's peak but have not yet peaked, I don't see how CA can escape seeing more than 123 cases per 100k population = 1.1x last year's peak and hence a 14-day average of 12k hospitalizations. And I don't see how this won't happen before Feb 1, as cases are soaring and will likely reach a 7-day average of 123 per 100k population in about 1 week. And I can't imagine hospital capacity precluding 12k being reached, because >22k was reached last year. I'm still trying to force myself to be at least a little cautious in this forecast, but my real instinct is to put this forecast at 99%. It's almost done, imo.

Base on England's experience so far, it's likely that the 7-day average of cases/day will peak at more than double last winter's peak of ~109 per 100k population. So if the hospital census at 30/100k is 4137, and if cases do reach double last year's cases, then it would not be unreasonable to expect the peak number hospitalized to reach at least 4137 / 30 * 109 * 2 = 30k. Will cases rise so high? I don't know, but I don't see why CA should be so special as to escape at least very high cases. And I do think it will happen very soon, perhaps within a couple weeks. As hospitalizations generally lag case by 7-10 days, I think a peak in hospitalizations should be reached in late January, possibly early February. Last year, the 7-day average of hospitalizations peaked on Jan 14, and cases peaked January 9 (at the tail end of a data reporting issue, so the actual peak could have been a couple days earlier). I think it's reasonable to expect Omicron cases to peak by mid Jan at the latest and then hospitalizations to peak most likely in the 2nd half of January. There's a lot of uncertainty in my mind about how high hospitalizations will go, but somewhere in the range 12k-30k+ seems possible to me."

During the Delta wave it took 50 days for hospitalisation to climb 7k and peak at over 8.5k on the 14-day average. In the current Omicron wave it would need to climb 8k within 35 days. So roughly 14% higher and 60% faster. The main uncertainty for me is not whether it will happen (I think it will) but whether it will be a few days earlier or later than 31st Jan. If hospitalised cases involve lengthy stays and cases climb very quickly, then it looks like the last week of Jan will be met, but a slower rise and shorter stays should smooth the curve and delay the peak a week or so. It now seems established that full vaccination plus a booster is the only way to maintain significant immunity against Omicron. California opened boosters to all residents in mid-November after prioritising the elderly for 2 months, but uptake has actually been better among younger age groups, and generally far lower than hoped and expected (something like 15-20%). So as a generalisation the more elderly with lower immunity are now more likely to need longer hospitalisation. Comparing with Canada's current situation of escalating cases within the context of much higher vaccination levels (76.2% of total population full dosed, compared to 67.4% in California), and increasing booster uptake, the speed of hospitalisation in California could change very rapidly. Median age may be a few years younger in California (36.5 against 40.1 in Ontario for example), but the lower immunity is perhaps more critical. Mask wearing is mandated but California has quite diverse mix of communities, vax rates, and health, so the key probably lies with factoring the speed of spread with age, immunity, and length of hospitalisation. I'll refine the forecast over next few days."

Let me try to shake off all of my previous thinking and look anew. If someone showed me the graphs of cases and hospitalizations for CA and told me it was for, say, some province in Canada, a completely new question, what would I think? I would think, Omicron is coming. The wave will be higher than last year's winter wave. It will likely peak around the third week in January nationally. It will peak in different places at different times, but Omicron is so contagious that it likely won't peak anywhere in ""Canada"" later than the first week of Feb or so. Aside from the question of when cases will peak, with exponential case growth, even if slowed a bit with some mitigations, cases will get really high in January. I can't imagine it going otherwise. I could easily imagine 80 cases/100k population by Jan 21, and I can't easily imagine how that wouldn't lead to 12k+ hospitalizations by the end of January. There is, of course, a huge amount of uncertainty here."

I'm expecting a national peak in cases around the third week in January; CA cases could peak before or after that. Hospitalizations lag cases by 1 week, of course. Also, what level of Omicron cases will correspond to 12k hospitalizations? Too many unknowns right now. But I do expect CA's peak to be much higher than its Delta peak because 1) Omicron is more contagious, 2) it will be winter, and 3) the population has very little immunity. But looking at this more closely, I don't see how Omicron cases won't reach ~50 cases/100k population, which, if this were Delta, would correspond to ~12k hospitalizations. And cases will likely go far higher than that, so that even if Omicron does end up having a lower hospitalization rate than Delta because of prior immunity, it'll still end up causing more hospitalizations.

While overall hospitalizations may decrease compared to last year this winter, the likelihood of reaching 12,000 in the next month (after thanksgiving and other holiday gatherings) is likely. California reached about 8,000 in September (after school was back in session) with most adults fully vaccinated and not in a colder month, so 12,000 seems like a number that could be reached during higher transmission months. Additionally, with vaccine efficacy waning and gaps in when/if people get booster shots decreases my faith in keeping transmission down."
