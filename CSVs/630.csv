Por ejemplo, en noviembre del 2020, Tesla ya tenía mas de 20 mil puntos de carga. Es por esto que l número de autos también ha ido aumentando, según la misma marca, en el primer cuarto del 2020, ya han producido cerca de 180000 vehículos y se espera que este número aumente.

From Statista, there isn't much noticeable seasonal difference in Q1-Q2 deliveries. Numbers mostly stable or increasing. 2. Needs to deliver 65.2k to hit 250k, which is about 36% of the average for the past 2 quarters. Seems highly unlikely that deliveries would be hit this hard, biggest shock was about 30% (Q4 2018 to Q1 2019). 3. Tesla states that it is still ramping up models 3/Y production in it's factory in Shanghai, and planning to ramp up production for S/X. If this happens, it's likely that production numbers will increase, so the upper bracket should be higher than the 182k mentioned before. Let's say Tesla manages to increase it's throughput of installed capacity from ~70% (182.7k in a quarter / 1050000 per year) to 75% (196.9k), the upper bracket should be 196.9 + 184.8 = 381.7 4. Considering a 10% shock possible (more factories than in 2019, China stable on COVID and US expected to stabilize over coming months), lower would be 164.4k, putting total at 349.2k. 5.

The recent semiconductor shortage is projected to lead to 1 million fewer vehicles produced in the first half of 2021, which I estimate amounts to 1-2% of annual worldwide production. Assuming 20% growth in the first half of 2021 compared to the second half of 2020, that puts us at 480k vehicles.

In 2020, Tesla came just short of their self-imposed projection of half a million deliveries, coming in at a record 499,550, with 320,163 of those happening in the second half of the year. In Q1, they fulfilled 88,496 orders, 90,891 in Q2, 139,593 in Q3, and 180,570 in Q4. Taking into consideration the 36% increase in deliveries from 2019 to 2020 - even with their main factory shutting down in mid-May due to covid-19, - and the 30% increase from Quarter 3 to Quarter 4, I felt confident that this rising trend would continue. One source projected that the company should be able to ship “more than 720,000 vehicles from its Fremont and Shanghai factories in 2021”, and confirmed the company will be opening two new factories in Berlin and Texas by the end of the year (https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/01/tesla-delivered-a-record-500000-vehicles-in-2020/). While Tesla can be expected to deliver somewhere between 500,000 and 1,000,000 vehicles in 2021, no one is certain of just how many of those fulfillments will take place in the first half of the year versus the latter half. However, considering that in order to hit or exceed the 350,000 target the company would have to deliver a minimum of 175,000 in Q1 and Q2 - a lesser number than Q4 of 2020 -, I felt bold enough to predict that there is a 80% probability they will deliver 350,000 or more vehicles, a 20% chance they will deliver more than 250,000 but less than 350,000, and a 0% probability they will deliver 250,000 vehicles or less."

Therefore, I think the first half of 2021 will continue with the trend seen at the end of 2020 and will show sales close to the last half of 2020."

Some forecasts have estimated deliveries in the 850,000 to 1 million range for 2021. This would put the estimates somewhere in the ballpark of 450,000 to 500,000 for the first half of 2021.

Model Y doesn't seem to pick up that fast, but is expected to keep growing steadily. So to us, while we can't exclude serious production issues or any other serious break, it seems that the barr of 250k should easily been exceeded. Question is then more around the 350k bar. INcluded were the absence of any new product launch and the projection of new factories (second half of 2021) which will brings some doubts on the ability to actually produce 500k units. Still seems possible. Missing in the analysis were serious loss of market share."

With Tesla expanding into China for production, by extension, there would seem to be much more demand in China (a huge electric vehicle market as well). However, potential trade embargoes with China hangs by a thread. With additional attention paid to climate change and the detrimental effects, there will be a large push towards the electric vehicles market, with Tesla leading the way in both funding (via addition to the S&P 500 and increases in its share price largely driven by this event) as well as first-mover advantage."
