"Before 1 July 2017, will Russia allow Turkish citizens to travel to Russia without a visa?",2016-10-04T17:00:10Z,2017-07-01T06:59:10Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Foreign Policy'],1520,654,334,237,"In 2011, Russia began allowing Turkish citizens to enter its territory without visas for a period of up to 30 days (TASS Russian News Agency). Russia suspended that arrangement in November 2015 after Turkish forces downed a Russian military jet (Washington Post, Business Insider). In August 2016, Russian president Vladimir Putin and President Erdogan moved toward rapprochement and committed to working toward a full restoration of economic and trade ties (NY Times, Washington Post). Shortly afterwards, Russia lifted the restrictions on charter flights to Turkey (Global Times). Recommended Questions Before 2018, will there be a new president of Zimbabwe? Will Recep Tayyip Erdogan cease to be President of Turkey before 1 August 2017? Before 2018, will Russia officially announce that it is suspending its participation in or withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty?",https://www.gjopen.com/questions/294-before-1-july-2017-will-russia-allow-turkish-citizens-to-travel-to-russia-without-a-visa

President Erdogan appears to be a volatile leader and appeasing him by loosening visa policy would be of very little benefit to the current geopolitical strategy of Russia. Historically, Russia is very good at protecting their homeland against terrorism, especially since an alliance with Chechnya has been solidified. The conflict in Raqqa is a major determining factor in negotiating visa free travel from Turkey to Russia, as well. The Turkish leadership is publicly outraged with the US arming the Kurds for the battle in Raqqa and Russia has taken a laissez faire attitude toward the strategy. Currently, the Turks are overestimating their geopolitical value and Russia will not give concessions to a country which is overestimating its position in the world. I predict Russia will not allow Turkish citizens to travel commercially to Russia without a visa."

The deputy foreign minister reportedly told Sputnik that Russia is ready to facilitate easier visa formalities for businesspeople working with Russia, while he noted that it is also important to work in this regard for Turkish truck drivers. Regarding visa procedures for airline staff, Meshkov said that they are currently in the final stage of discussions regarding visa procedures for airline staff. Russia had imposed economic sanctions, including the suspension of visa-free travel, on Turkey at the start of last year. Last week, the Russian government signed a decree allowing visa-free travel to the country's far eastern Vladivostok city for 18 countries, including Turkey. https://www.dailysabah.com/diplomacy/2017/04/22/russia-ready-to-ease-visa-procedures-for-turkish-citizens-deputy-fm-meshkov"

The Russian Deputy PM said that Putin had said that Russia would continue to require visa for Turkish citizens but that could change depending on the level of cooperation between security forces. So effectively the new relationship is on trial. A trial of just seven weeks (to 1 July) would seem very short.

Turkey, with the constant Kurdish threat lingering above it, can't make strategic plans, rather It has to react on daily basis to the volatile situation. Russia is open for good relations with all nations who deal with it in a fair and truthful way without second agenda. Who ever has a second agenda, who ever is not following the international laws, who ever tries to talk to Russia from above, who ever is abusing the supposedly free press to misinform the world community, will not succeed. People know very well, who is invading illegally other countries, who is organizing illegally coups, who is financing and supplying the ISIS with weapons and the motivation behind it, namely to keep up the Petrodollar scheme, since OPEC sells it's crude oil for US$ only, which keeps the US currency artificially way above it's real value. Once this scheme will be broken, such questions about the visa travel between Turkey and Russia will become interesting only for second raw historians. Till then, let the CIA guess whether the tourist Otzturk needs a visa to visit Moscow or not. It would be glad to introduce in to Russia couple new radical Islamist to steer unrest, LOL."
