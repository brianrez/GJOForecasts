First, if we look at statistics provided by the European UnionÍs East StratCom Task Force, we can see that during the last week 36 cases were identified, for the last month - 198 cases. From the topics of the latest disinformation cases, it is clear that a lot of attention gets Ukraine and, especially, the 2019 Ukrainian Presidential Election. Therefore, it is important to take into account that the second round of the election will be held on next Sunday. It is very likely to trigger the number of disinformation cases. However, even though the higher number can be expected, it should not change dramatically from the previous numbers."

In March 2015 the EU created the European External Action Service East Stratcom Task Force, which publishes weekly reports in its website 'EU vs Disinfo'. The website and its partners identified and debunked over 3,500 pro-Kremlin disinformation cases between September 2015 and November 2017, which means between 1512 to 1750 per year. At the moment when this forecast is made - 10.04.2019 - there have been 5209 cases recorded, which renders it relatively safe to assume that within a week's time the total number will not exceed 5500. I am 95% confident that this will remain so. It is also clear why the options below that number are outruled. Statistics for the past three years (2016-2018) indicate a monthly average of 126 cases, which means that it would take another 2.4 months for the number to exceed 5500."

As of today - 2 March 2018 - there already have been 4973 Russian disinformation campaigns registered by the EEAS; thus, a higher number than given in the first two options. The forecast at hand estimates a likelihood of 65% that there will be in total 4901 till 5499 Russian disinformation campaigns noted on 18 April 2019. Even in 2016, a year to be considered very turbulent for wold politics and Russian interests - Brexit, US elections, refugee crises in Europe and Russian supported military operations in Syria, e.g. in Eastern Aleppo (https://www.cfr.org/blog/ten-most-significant-world-events-2016), there were only 2023 Russian disinformation campaigns detected by the EEAS - an average of 169 cases per month. Even if it is assumed that those numbers vary from month to month and peak during events, considered as strategically important to Russia, an increase about more than one third seems rather unlikely, in particular given the fact that last months there were only 178 counted as well. However, three events in March (and May) could lead to a drastic increase of detected information campaigns: First, presidential elections are to be hold in the Ukraine on 31 March 2019. Due to the on-going conflict between Russia and the Ukraine pro-Russian public support has decreased drastically (https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/why-pro-russian-candidates-won-t-win-ukraine-s-2019-elections). Thus, Russia could expand its disinformation campaigns in order to make up for these losses and prevent a further approximation of the Ukraine and the EU. The UK’s - yet not so sure - exit from the EU is originally planed to be realized on 29 March 2019. Given to Russians previous pro-Brexit engagement (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/10/17/russian-iranian-twitter-trolls-sent-10-million-tweets-fake-news/), a rise of detected case might be counted. Finally, the elections for the EU parliament will be hold between 23 - 26 May 2019. Not only is an increase in Anti-EU disinformation campaigns of Russia expected to happen before (March/April), e.g. to promote anti-EU parties, but also an increased engagement by the EEAS to detect those attacks in order to safeguard the elections. This could also impact the two former mentioned points (Ukraine/Brexit) and will most likely cause an increase in cases detected. Thus the forecast at hand estimates an 35% chance that 5500 - 6300 cases of Russian disinformation campaigns will be detected by the EEAS. Finally, the forecast at hand rules out the fifth option. In 2017, there were a total of 1321 cases detected, when e.g. Germany and France held - for Russia - crucial elections. Thus, it is ruled out that in the next 47 days more cases will be detected (1328) than through all 2017."

Therefore this fake count is fake it self. People will continue to read Russian sources, since the truth has no borders. See the result of the former USSR. The Russians have taken their lessons. The West is this time behind, to it's own peril. In German there is a saying: Luegen haben kurze Beine - which means lies have short legs ... - the fake gas poisoning in UK, which was proven to be a staged attack with poison recently patented in US. Same in Syria, where a secret storage and lab was discovered today where the west supported terrorists produced toxic gases to stage a provocation. Also the video clip with ""White Helmets"" which was broadcast on all western media was proven to be a fake - now the presumably intoxicated children tell to the whole world that it was staged for a sweet and almonds. The West is trying to defend its hegemonic position, which is lost for good. Neither Russia, nor China or India will buckle down - there is no reason for it any more - neither militarily, nor economically. The West will have very soon a new political elite, which will be able to make the needed adjustments in it's approach to the rest of the world, which will be multi-polar. It will have to listen more, and compromise on many issues. Till then, let's hope that the western elite, which came up after the collapse of USSR and get used to act without being held accountable for multiple wars, orange revolutions, bombing, blackmailing, illegal sanctions, etc. will step down from the stage without doing too much harm to it's own nations and the rest of the world by provoking a military confrontation among the nuclear superpowers."
