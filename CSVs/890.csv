In looking at curves it appears coronavirus takes 4 to 6 weeks to peak. It looks like two more weeks to peak level. While you could model how many more cases a day before it levels off in two weeks let us say average of 3000. 3000 times 14 is 42000 more cases through April 10th. That leaves about 7 weeks left. The curve starts going down for 4 weeks averaging 1700 new cases a day. 30 days is another 51000 cases. 3 weeks left at 1000 cases a day or 21000 more. 14543 as of today. All added is: 128,543. China’s death rate was about 4% and UK so far looks to be about 5%. Let us go with 5% or 6427. This of course could be much better modeled using a computer but rough estimate is between 6500 to 7500."
