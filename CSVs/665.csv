Crowd forecast suggest below 400 is very unlikely but it was below 400 at the end of October and given its volatility (I think in part because it is a news worthy stock) I think there is more of a chance of it dropping below 400. On the other end, rising to above 520 would mean an 18% rise in less than two weeks and hitting an all time high. While not impossible this seems highly unlikely. While I have 440 as the current base, contending with news of a likely end of year bull run on the stock market in general pushes the likelihood into the 440-480 range. Read an article suggesting a leak from the supply chain report shows Tesla production capabilities might beat expectations in China but haven't really taken it into account given lack of provenance"
