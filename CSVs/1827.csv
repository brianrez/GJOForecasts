Will an Uber self-driving car with a member of the public as a passenger be involved in an auto accident while driving autonomously between 14 October 2016 and 1 January 2017?,2016-10-14T17:00:57Z,2016-12-31T18:00:00Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']","['Business', 'Technology']",511,654,244,237,"This question was closed as ""no"" with an end date of 31 December 2016. Although there were some reports that Uber vehicle was involved in an accident in October (WTAE Pittsburgh), there was no evidence that there was a passenger in the car or that the vehicle was in autonomous mode. There are no indications of other accidents. See our FAQ to learn about how we resolve questions and how scores are calculated. In the first public test of self-driving cars in the US, Uber recently launched a program where the public can hail and ride in one of the company’s autonomous vehicles (Uber, NY Times). Each car has two Uber employees seated in the front seats who can take control when needed (NPR, Scientific American). However, concerns remain about the safety of these cars at this initial stage of development, especially in light of the recent accidents involving a Tesla Model S (The Verge), and a Google self-driving car (Quartz). For this question to resolve as “yes”, an Uber self-driving car must physically contact another vehicle or object while driving autonomously. Malfunctions that do not result in an accident would not be sufficient to resolve the question (e.g. Quartz). Recommended Questions Before 2017, will Google announce that it will conduct public testing of its fully autonomous vehicles in a US city?",https://www.gjopen.com/questions/300-will-an-uber-self-driving-car-with-a-member-of-the-public-as-a-passenger-be-involved-in-an-auto-accident-while-driving-autonomously-between-14-october-2016-and-1-january-2016

I don't believe that the self-driving technology offers any improvement over the human supervisors, and indeed the humans are improving the self-driving performance. The evaluation period is 79 days, or .2164 of a year, so I adjusted the accident rate for that. I further adjusted for the fact that only 30% of the evaluation period remains as of today (12/8/16). I assumed that a public passenger will be in the car only 1/2 the time. Finally, I accounted for 14 Ford Fusions being on the road as part of this test for the full period, and added 1 full-period equivalent for the Volvos that are supposed to be introduced by the end of the year. (I don't think they will arrive much before the very end of the year, hence my estimate of only 1 full-period equivalent.)

Uber would only deploy them if they believed that the cars were approximately as safe as human drivers (so we can estimate using statistics based on human traffic). This is reinforced by the presence of a human driver, prepared to override the system if necessary. 1. There are going to be 100 vehicles in Uber's autonomous fleet by year's end. We don't know how many cars Uber has or will successfully deliver, but a better assumption is that they're on schedule and delivering linearly, indicating that half of the car*miles in the whole fleet assumption actually get driven. 2. 1. It seems like Uber drivers in metropolitan areas (like Pittsburgh, home of Uber's autonomous fleet) travel around 100 miles per 8 hr. shift. That said, I don't know how long they're on the road daily--could be as much as 24hr. 3. If all of them were on the road today, and all of them did 24 hour shifts, then there'd be 100 Cars * 300 miles / car*day * 41 car*days = 1,230,000 car*miles. My best guess is that the actual number is 50 cars * 100 miles / car*day * 41 car*days = 105,000 car*miles to be driven by year's end. 4. I can't find a great estimate for the ratio of accidents to miles driven, but an adequate one seems to be around 1 accident per 100,000 car*miles. Accordingly, the expected number of accidents is around 1 accident."

29074,2016-10-17T00:43:12Z,1,[6.0],[6.0],Google's cars had an accident about 1 time a month when they had 23 vehicles. I think the uber vehicles won't be driving the same distance that the Google cars were. Someone else calculated that human drivers would get in 2 accidents during this time driving about 300k miles. Other people have mentioned that adding 2 safety drivers decreases the risk. I don't think that matters because the accidents will most likely be the fault of a non-uber car if Google's reports are comparable (which I think they are).

I then would plot maps or safe routes for Uber cars to drive where no or very few accidents occurred. That means I would also plot times of accidents and weather conditions...etc..etc. Uber AV cars probably drive the safest routes in the city, only in daylight during time periods when few if any accidents occur."
