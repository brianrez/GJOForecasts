The Washington Post, December 27, 'Documents shed light on North Korea’s startling gains in sea-based missile technology': https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/documents-shed-light-on-north-koreas-startling-gains-in-sea-based-missile-technology/2017/12/27/dd82878a-e749-11e7-ab50-621fe0588340_story.html?utm_term=.4ab124da02cc Clips from article: ""On June 22, 2016, North Korea successfully tested a mysterious new missile that differed dramatically from anything in Pyongyang’s known arsenal. The 36-foot-tall missile had a squat, snub-nosed frame and used a liquid propellent more powerful than the kerosene-based fuels the North Koreans had used in the past, potentially allowing it to fly farther, with heavier payloads. The missile was dubbed the Hwasong-10, or Musudan. But experts noted striking similarities to the R-27 Zyb, or Ripple, manufactured by the Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau. Two months later, on Aug. 24, 2016, North Korea successfully tested the Pukguksong-1, a submarine-launched missile that also incorporates some features from the Zyb. Both models are “generally regarded as derived from the designs of the Makeyev Bureau’s R-27,” said Joshua Pollack, an analyst at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey, Calif. Those two tests were followed in recent months by even greater technological leaps, culminating in the successful tests this year of North Korea’s first true intercontinental ballistic missiles, capable of reaching every city in the continental United States. There have been no further tests of the Musudan, but satellite images released this month show that North Korea is building floating barges thought to be intended for tests of new submarine-launched missiles. The construction is occurring in two different ports on opposite sides of the country. U.S. analysts also believe that North Korea is working on an improved version of the Pukguksong."""

They were about 80% done with new sub capable of SLBM in late Sept but they are not going to risk that sub without more barge testing. Still Iran could supply them a missile but wonder if Iran has all it can handle now with Saudi push back. It seems NK has quieted provocative action for now. Lowering. Follow 38 North often!

The US might try to disturb this process by means of digital warefare. However there's no information about that available, supporting this claim. Looking back at activities in Iran on their nuclear program, it's at least possible. Clearly there are activities ongoing in the ballistic submarine and SLBM area. Buildling a ballistic submarine would suggest also the development of the launching mechanism - with a possible test. There's a lot of propaganda going on from all sides, so it's hard to extract thruth from intentional rumours. https://www.38north.org/2017/11/sinpo111617/ http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/north-koreas-ballistic-missile-submarine-major-threat-or-23308"

I would think we have assets focused on that possibility. The North Koreans cannot afford to lose a submarine. I think the possibility does not depend on whether they have the technology or not but if having the technology they would actually do it.

Kim Jong-un appreciates that this action could escalate tensions beyond his desired level (i.e. U.S. strike or intervention). He would likely keep this option close hold under his escalation of force continuum as a response to an increased level, or capability, in U.S. military demonstrations beyond historical norms.

In September 2017, Japan’s Asahi Shimbun had reported a failed test of a new solid-fuel engine for a submarine-launched ballistic missile at Sinpo, but The Diplomat was unable to confirm that such a test had taken place. North Korea is not known to carry out engine tests at Sinpo, which remains largely dedicated to ship and submarine-building."" Comments: 1 ballistic missile sub under construction. Note: SLBM ejection tests conducted during warmer, summer months. The Diplomat, October 18, 'The Sinpo-C-Class: A New North Korean Ballistic Missile Submarine Is Under Construction U.S. intelligence has detected a large, new submarine under construction: the Sinpo-C': https://thediplomat.com/2017/10/the-sinpo-c-class-a-new-north-korean-ballistic-missile-submarine-is-under-construction/ Clips from Diplomat article: ""North Korea has a single Gorae-class submarine in its inventory. The submarine has not entered operational use and is the only North Korean submarine capable of launching the KN11/Pukguksong-1 submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM). U.S. intelligence assesses the submarine’s submerged displacement to be approximately 2,000 tons. The Gorae-class submarine has seen improvements as recently as this year. Early in the summer, the submarine was fitted with a new launch tube, The Diplomat has learned. It is unknown if the launch tube is meant to accommodate the extant Pukguksong-1 SLBM or whether the Gorae-class may soon operate a newer SLBM that may require a redesigned launch tube, with the Pukguksong-1 potentially retired for a newer missile. North Korea released potential evidence in late-August of a new solid-fuel SLBM, the Pukguksong-3, though the existence of this missile remains unconfirmed by U.S. intelligence. A new North Korean SLBM may feature an advanced airframe using lighter composite materials that could lead to it exhibiting a considerably greater total range than the first-generation Pukguksong-1. This summer, North Korea carried out repeated SLBM ejection tests at its test stand near the Sinpo shipyard where the Gorae-class is ported and where the Sinpo-C submarine is under construction."" U.S. intelligence recorded ejection tests on May 30, July 18, July 25, and July 30. No ejection new tests have taken place at Sinpo since July. Ejection tests allow North Korean engineers to verify the operation of the missile’s cold-launch system, which pushes the missile through the sea’s surface before its engines ignite. Prior to North Korea’s second ICBM test in July, U.S. intelligence had assessed that a new SLBM flight test was likely. This assessment was revised downward in August following North Korea’s second ICBM test in late-July. As of early October, an SLBM flight test was not seen as imminent by U.S. intelligence."
