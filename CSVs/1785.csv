I don't see anything in the question saying the tax has to be a new tax, just that it is newly applied to soda. Its very common to exempt food stuff from tax, so taxing any food is either saying its regarded as a luxury or that it is a ""sin"" to consume it. I assume the question is aimed at the ""sin"" aspect (e.g. Soda drinks are not good for you, so a tax that puts people off buying it is a ""good"" thing.) But there is clearly a grey area around this. In the UK the similar tax is being added on the sugar content, which is in addition to the standard rate of VAT that is already added to food stuffs that are not considered necessities. It could be argued that the Arkansas tax is not a special soda tax, just reclassifying soft drinks as a non-grocery item."

We have a sugar commission that did that. The E Commerce board had a hand abd the E education commission got text book exempts. All why using us Vets as camouflage for it all.

According to at least one commentator only certain services (mostly manual labor such as hair styling, lawncare, babysitting, etc.) would be affected, while ""intellectual"" services (such as lawyers and accountants) would not. That there is a (presumed) correlation between interest-group lobbying and the targets of the service tax is just coincidental I'm sure.

However, a small tax on soda would help state finances and carries a far lower political risk due to its size.

First the evidence is not complete yet, its not clear what the right level of tax is to achieve the objective of reducing obesity and how it should be calculated. (e.g. per the volume of the drink or per amount of sugar or per the amount of sweetener). It is not completely clear if the aim is reduce obesity or to raise tax revenue to fund the costs of obesity. My guess is that US states will prefer to see how Soda Taxes go in cities that are just introducing them before introducing State Taxes. Second the trend to populist policies (i.e. Trump) where evidence gives way to gut feelings (and I bet the Soda guzzlers have a lot of gut feelings) might mean that Soda Taxes are seen as another manifestation of the rights of the working man (and woman) to make themselves obese if they choose to. being interfered with by out of touch urban health nuts."
