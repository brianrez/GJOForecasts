Will there be any publicly disclosed cyber attacks on nuclear facilities before the end of 2016?,2016-01-19T18:00:10Z,2016-12-31T18:00:51Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']","['Technology', 'Security and Conflict']",2147,654,539,237,"This question was closed as ""no"" with an end date of 31 December 2016. In making this decision, the question team carefully reviewed the open source evidence of three different incidents. The first two incidents were reviewed when the initial news broke and again at the end of the year. The third was considered when the 2016 report from the Nuclear Threat Initiative was released. The first incident was the discovery of malware in a German nuclear power plant in May 2016. At the time, there was insufficient evidence to close question because it was unclear whether the malware was introduced into the system as part of an attack or if it was introduced inadvertently. A clarification relaying this decision was issued at that time. Although NTI counts this incident in their 2016 report (NTI), they present no new evidence about the incident and also go on to classify the intent of the act as ""unknown"" rather than as ""intentional"" or ""accidental."" With no additional evidence on how the malware was introduced, our decision in May remains unchanged. The second incident involved the release of data from a hydrogen isotope research center in Japan. In June, it was revealed that a PC at the facility was infected with a virus in November of 2015 and subject to remote control until late December 2015. Data from the research center was released in March and June of 2016, during the question's open period (Japan Times). It is unclear whether all the data was stolen in 2015 and released in 2016, or if some of the released data was acquired by the perpetrators during 2016. However, sources agree that the November 2015 spearfishing attack was what enabled the data to be stolen (Japan Times, eSecurity Planet), and because the spearfishing attack occurred prior to the question’s open period this incident does not qualify. The third incident was the at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission/Department of Energy and is listed in the NTI report with a February 2016 date, but the perpetrator of the incident was indicted for these actions in the spring of 2015, so the attack occurred prior to the question's open period (FBI). Given the clarification issued in May and the lack of subsequent evidence, there is insufficient evidence to close this question as ""yes"" based on the incident at the German power plant. The attack on the Japanese power plant began in 2015, prior to the question's open period, and so does not qualify, as did the Department of Energy incident. Threats emanating from the cyber realm have been increasing in frequency and severity. In just the last month, we saw Russia sanctioned for using cyber to disrupt elections, Kiev's power grid turned off after a cyber attack, and a huge merger put in jeopardy after Yahoo revealed that millions of its accounts had been hacked. The unique nature of the cyber domain creates challenges for adjudicating forecasting questions using open source material and requires that these questions be less precise than others you'll find on the site but given the growing importance of this threat, it is worth working through this ambiguity so that the Good Judgment forecasting community can engage on these issues and the wisdom of the crowd can be leveraged. We will be launching an open question next week to solicit your ideas on what questions we should be asking about this important topic and also how we should be asking those questions. We hope you will share your thoughts and continue to engage on the important issues of the day here at Good Judgment Open.",https://www.gjopen.com/questions/113-will-there-be-any-publicly-disclosed-cyber-attacks-on-nuclear-facilities-before-the-end-of-2016

That is consistent with the inventory of incidents by NTI. Does ""incident"" equal attack in the event, seems like either Gemmingen or Japan represent an attack rather than an accident.

But a laptop used by a student in a warehouse that stored nuclear medical material that got a virus that stole an Amazon password would not. There must be thousands of places that use or research some kind of nuclear material, that could be called ""nuclear facilities"", but most of us would not call it that. A ""cyber attack"" sounds as if it means it was specifically targeted, but most malware is targeted at something. A ""targeted attack"" could be targeted at users of specific hardware, or software which could be specific to one facility or it could be targeted at duel use hardware or software.

Hacking incidents at banks in Bangladesh, Vietnam and Ecuador have called that guarantee into question. In each case, the attackers were able to obtain the banks’ Swift access codes and send authenticated but fraudulent requests to transfer funds. Swift wasn’t aware of the incidents in Vietnam or Ecuador until well after the attacks had taken place. Thieves stole $81 million from Bangladesh’s central bank in February and about $9 million from a lender in Ecuador last year. More such incidents could emerge. Swift said in a note said it knew of recent fraud at a “small number” of customers. Cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc. said the thieves behind the Bangladesh attack appear to still be active."

The public in countries with nuclear facilities have been strongly persuaded that they are a major element in their security. Such an attack would be alarming to the authorities in revealing their vulnerability but is unlikely to pose a major threat unless there are serious hostilities in progress. Stuxnet is not relevant, because it disabled centrifuges in a country that was developing a nuclear facility, not one that already had a stockpile. The reports seem to be confused between nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants with an implication that if a power plant is disabled the perpetrators can run away with material from which they could make a bomb. I would contend that it is not that easy. Imposing sanctions in the event of such an attack could not be done without disclosing the reasons to the public, thereby raising alarm about security."

This however is a hard process to do and is limited to only a handful of countries being capable to of that kind of hack. Ukraine does have nuclear powered facilities and therefore could be a potential target for any more black energy attacks. The sandstorm network likely responsible for this attack have also attacked other European and NATO nations with cyber. Additionally to this western powers could use attacks like stuxnet on any foreign nuclear facility they suspect is actually weaponising this power. The other part of this is the disclosure as some governments are likely to not want to cause panic by admitting that their nuclear facilities have been hacked as this is likely to cause more bad press to an already controversial power method as well as damaging their political power. I chose this number on the number of facilities that are likely to be targeted by the few countries capable then deducting for countries who are unlikely to report it.

Nitro Zeus wasn't launched, - but was disclosed, which makes me question it since its now featured in a documentary, and feels like a cautionary tale more than a post-event analysis - like the Stuxnet attack. Here's my 'straw man plan': - Number of nuclear facilities operational by country, with MWe Net - Existing conflicts between top nation-states with the greatest # of operable facilities and MWe. - Type of cyber attack - Zero Day/SCADA vulnerability - how these are introduced into the facilities & the time it takes to execute: example: Stuxnet took years to develop, but now the blueprint for it exists in the open. - Development of cyber defense post Stuxnet that would counter these attacks - How are attacks reported out publicly - by what means? My assumption is that an attack capable of dismantling a nuclear facility would take time to develop, then would take time to implement post-Stuxnet, and the subsequent publicly acknowledged disclosure of this would be contested and guarded against so I'm initially predicting a low probability for before the end of 2016.

If you're not familiar with the tokamak, it is a reactor which contains a mini-fusion reaction, like a very small sun, that is contained within a magnetic field (so as to not vaporize the chamber). It's a lot like the early NASA program was to the extent that the science is pretty much all there, they just need the finest possible engineering to make it work. This is such a potential game-changer. Very exciting."

The source is identified in the notes as a “A US industrial control systems expert who was trained as a nuclear engineer.” Third, there is no time parameter with respect to the estimated attacks. Have these additional 45 or so attacks taken place since 1992, 2002, 2012? Some idea as to the recent frequencies would help with understanding the trends.

This leaves either former employees or foreign governments with civilian nuclear energy programs that use the same technology as possible attackers. In the case of a former employee attack, public disclosure is not likely. A former employee, no matter how disgruntled, would not cause a meltdown to endanger thousands of lives in the form that would be immediately apparent to the public. The basic physiological screening required of employees in nuclear plants does prevent the hiring of someone so inclined to mass destruction. In the case of a smaller scale event, such as threatening the lives of employees in specific areas of the plant, it would not be publicly disclosed. There are many foreign governments with nuclear programs that work with major civilian nuclear energy systems, such as Turkey. An attack would undermine public trust in civilian nuclear energy. Knowing that an attack would undermine civilian nuclear energy a lifelong scholar that is working in a civilian nuclear energy program would be unwilling to participate in that attack. While participation could be coerced, the complexity of a remote attack would make it impossible for one person or a small group to pull off under duress. I think an attack by a government currently cooperating in civilian nuclear energy programs will not happen in 2016. The last possible is someone without knowledge in civilian nuclear systems attacking a system remotely. This is very possible, but it is not possible that anyone achieve an ends without understanding the systems involved. If an attack of this unprepared kind were to happen there would be no result and it would not be disclosed publicly. I think it is not probable at all that there is a real attack on nuclear facilities disclosed to the public. I think there is a chance that a public announcement is made about a perceived threat, potential attack, or imagined attack for political purposes but that this event and announcement will have no supporting evidence of an actual attack, attacker, motive, or specific target."

There would be nothing to be gained for the authorities from publicly disclosing that a failed attack had occurred. If, however, a cyber attack succeeded in some fashion, then public disclosure would be more likely since disclosure would contribute to answering the public's questions about why there was some sort of failure or irregularity at the nuke plant in the first place.
