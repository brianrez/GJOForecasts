I found this article at https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/10/1932. Searched for 'simultaneous hurricanes' 'interacting hurricanes' etc on Google Scholar without much luck. I suspect that formation in a given region is not independent assuming that hurricane formation is driven by thermodynamics and that within a given geographic area there is only so much potential energy available for formation - at a given time. Not a scintillating insight but it is plausible. This sounds like a great atmospheric physics question for someone at UC Boulder involved in the annual hurricane forecasts.

If I think the odds of a category 3+ hurricane forming are 14% and use a naive independence assumption, that would lead me to estimate the likelihood of an additional category 3+ hurricanes forming as nearly 2% (14% * 14%). I strongly suspect there is a crowding out effect though, so I'm remaining at 1% for the ""6 or more"" bin, but I'd be very curious if someone has a better framework for thinking about this."

As well, the Insurance Information Institute projected 4 major hurricanes for the 2021 season (https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-hurricanes). However, given that the hurricane activity has been above normal and a La Niña weather pattern has kicked in late in the hurricane season (https://www.weather.gov/media/bou/LaNinaOutlook_Oct21.pdf), there is still potential for another major hurricane in the US before the close of the 2021 hurricane season.

Not as likely as just having 1 more which I now think is more likely than I previously thought. Now that I look at past hurricane seasons with 4 cat 3s or higher before today's date, they very often have another storm in October and quite frequently 2 more. That said, I only find 6 previous years with 4 cat3s before today's date, so statistical significance is impossible. But better with some data than none. Maybe there is a physical reason for this, like very warm water temperatures and those persist for some time. I am almost tempted to use these 6 previous seasons to really increase the chance of 5 or 6 but am hesitant to do so as I think NOAAs forecast from August is still quite relevant and takes into account a lot of atmospheric physics."
