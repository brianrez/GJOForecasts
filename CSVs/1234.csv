Per the Economist: “Whoever wins the general election on December 12th will have reason to worry about the economy. Purchasing managers’ indices aim to take the pulse of business, and for now they point to an economy on the slide. Monday’s manufacturing data and Tuesday’s construction survey showed both those industries contracting. Today it was the turn of the all-important service sector, supposedly the economy’s great strength. It was equally gloomy; new orders fell at their fastest pace since mid 2016. PMIs in Britain tend to overshoot on both the downside and upside. In July 2016, immediately after the Brexit referendum, they pointed towards an imminent recession which never arrived. They are still worth watching though. And the picture they paint is consistent with other data sources and most forecasters. Brexit and wider political uncertainty are holding back investment, and growth looks likely to be under 1.5% next year. That will keep the public finances under pressure, leaving less room for the giveaways that all parties are pledging.”"

However, it is of course totally possible that risk spreads will widen due to a chaos Brexit and in fact, I expect a no-deal Brexit and a recession in the UK, but I currently do not think that this will be enough to harm the UK and endanger government debt payments so much that a rating downgrade would be justified. A main difference between the UK and many other economis is, that the UK is indebted more or less only in its own currency, so that even a strong exchange rate fluctuation does not lead to a rise of real debt."

For on schedule/delayed and deal or no-deal I estimate: a) deal Brexit as scheduled: 35% b) no-deal brexit as scheduled: 20% c) deal Brexit delayed: 30% d) no-deal Brexit delayed: 10% e) UK revokes announcement to leave EU according to Article 50: 5%
