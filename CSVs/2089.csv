This not an imprisonment for a traffic ticket, religious blasphemy or any other inane reason. While I agree that he will be released I question the utility of a release which comes at a greater cost for Iran relative to the expected utilities of other possibilities and interactions with the US or EU. While and appeal is forthcoming, it is unlikely that this irrational decision would be overturned based on expectations of those of us at home (however well intentioned and necessary for Rezaian). Iran is a Theocracy, not a Democracy tilted toward Islamist (Sharia Law) and authoritarian pragmatics for its polity. From an Iranian perspective, it could be strongly argued that there is no gain in releasing Rezaian early or soon (whether through appeal or length of sentence) based on some altruist interest toward what it views as, in its revolutionary parlance, ""The Great Satan."" What is rational decision making for the Iranians does not mirror and American or European view of rational decision making. Its institutional political structure, the role of the IRGC and its relationship to the Supreme Leader and a dominant hardline view in its parliamentary structures, makes analysis of the Iranian theocracy a complex matter. I am not arguing for the supremacy of one perspective over another but rather that all is not as it seems. In the Rezaian case, it never has been."

He has been publicly sentenced and publicly imprisoned, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will take a public deal to get him released. Compare Rezaian with the recent release of Jonathan Pollard. Pollard was released under parole terms put in place at the time of his sentencing. Rezian's sentence, let alone the terms of his parole, is unknown. There is a political upside for Israel, or at least for Netanyahu, in the Pollard case; there is no comparable political upside in the Rezaian case. Pollard had an advocate in Netanyahu and some of the Israeli press; Rezaian has a similar advocate in the Washington Post. That's important. A hostage who has been forgotten is a hostage who has no value. I'm reducing my prediction a little, but I'm still on the positive side of release."
368,2015-11-23T21:51:07Z,53,[48.0],[-3.0],"Given the leverage which Iran can utilize in sentencing and holding Rezaian (including not making public the precise nature of the prison term), it seems likely that Rezaian will be release at a future horizon. The real question then becomes whether that release will occur before October 2016. I suspect that since the sentencing without a publicized term has occurred recently, while reported over the last week, holding Rezaian over a longer period of time provides a greater negotiating utility for the Iranians in other diplomatic and military interactions (Syria, Nuclear Agreement, US, regional conflict/hegemony). This utility increases the costs for US diplomatic and military interactions in the international system as events unfold over time. Perhaps separating the release of American prisoners from the negotiated nuclear deal (in retrospect) was a mistake: had their release been obtained at the time, future costs of utility and leverage for both US and Iran (and other actors) would have obtained a different power configuration."

I still suspect that Rezaian and other captives will be a bargaining chip that Iran could use to significant advantage. Another perspective is a strong possibility that if their bargaining value decreases over time, we can expect no release in the short to medium term. However in politics, October 2016 is almost a decade away. Difficult to predict what will happen here. Whether there will be any success with an appeal for the sentence imposed on Rezaian is certainly a strong indicator of where things will go in the longer term."

6583,2015-10-25T16:48:10Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"Iran has undeniably presented itself recently in a manner consistent with a nation willing to ""play ball"". However, even the term ""play ball"" is somewhat of a naive statement as any action taken by Iran is not based upon any type of good-will or progression. This is a childish notion; beyond naive. Iran has only ever made concessions based on ulterior motive. In order to secure sanction relieve it easily manipulated Western powers into a meaningless contract based upon inspection mandates that cannot possibly be successfully implemented. Iran is the brilliant successor to the Nazi regime defined by a cold hard and calculating Machiavellian-Utilitarian philosophy that every action taken, no matter how distasteful Iran finds it, is merely means to an end. Surprising this end is quite radical, and publicly espoused by every sector of Iranian society, from the peasants to the Ayatollah. They demand an end to Western dominance, Christianity, Judaism, and of course the destruction of the United States and Israel. The only comical element to all of this is how blatantly obvious it is, and Iran's resolve not to hide it. They basically say: ""Yeah, we lied about all that. Thanks for the money bitches. Death to the West. Iran out"". The idealist would advocate nothing more than the pathetic notion that one can secularize a *hithole like Iran. It can't be done. Sadam did a fantastic job as a balance of power, until foreign intervention and Bush policy eradicated all hope of stability in the Middle East. The fact of the matter is, as grotesque a premise as it is, the Middle East will only cease to cause problems if (like the British Empire) we employ the very same means-to-ends resolution. Brutal, powerful, bad-to-the-bone dictators like Assad that the West can buy off. Some would argue that the citizenry wants freedom. I would counter with ""people in hell want ice water"". Too damn bad. Not only do people so manipulated and per-versed by something as primitive as Islam not deserve freedom, they are not intellectually capable of understanding the basic concept. Their standard of life is not relevant to me, not in the slightest, my children's is. That's where my priorities lie and that's where yours should as well. The U.S. attempted an experiment, an experiment that already failed the Soviets. The difference is that the Russians learned from their mistakes, and are equipped to handle the Middle East. They understand what Western classical liberalism refuses to accept. That tolerance is not an absolute, and was never intended to function as such. Tolerance rather, is totally relative based upon the crucial element of reciprocation. Tolerance only functions when the majority and minority reciprocate a mutual respect."

Again, sadly, the more Iran follows through with the deal the more likely the hardliners will insist Jason stay in Iran so as to counter the look Iran is weakening to the West.

102,2015-09-03T22:43:50Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],Obama has votes for Iran nuclear agreement. However continued holding of hostages will give Republicans an edge in next election. Because of new business opportunities opening up hard to say if Republican President would scuttle agreement. In any event keeping hostages will increase volatility and decrease business opportunities for Iran. In the end I think bazaari logic will prevail and they will release some hostages. Visit by cleric to Amir Hekmati is positive sign. [1]

59,2015-09-03T10:36:39Z,1,[20.0],[20.0],"Perhaps before October 2016, but not likely, given how long the time line is for the lifting of sanctions."
93,2015-09-03T02:20:12Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],"I'm guessing December... an immediate release may appear internally as a concession, or part of the deal."
36,2015-09-03T01:28:45Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],I'm expecting a conviction on something. At that point I think a release becomes less likely.

38,2015-09-02T07:42:27Z,1,[29.0],[29.0],I don't see Iran doing this out of the goodness of its heart. What/who would they trade him for? Keeping him satisfies Iranian hardliners.
29,2015-09-02T06:24:49Z,1,[65.0],[65.0],"There is a reasonable chance he will be released as part of a thawing of relations. However, if it doesn't happen soon, I would adjust downward significantly."
32,2015-09-02T02:19:39Z,1,[60.0],[60.0],I think he will be released within this timeframe as an indirect part of the nuclear/sanctions deal. It will probably happen around some holiday and will be spun as another sign of the Iranian government's incredible kindness
