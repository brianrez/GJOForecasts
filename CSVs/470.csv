The number of new housing starts took a significant dip in the late 2000s due to the housing crisis, but has been steadily climbing back to pre-recession levels ever since. There did exist another downturn in mid-2020, most likely due to a combination of the pandemic and the high cost of building materials, but even this was not enough to affect the rate for long and it has since rebounded and is continuing its upward trajectory. According to the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (2021), as of August of this year there were 1,615,000 Housing starts, a 3.9% increase above July predictions and 17.4% increase from the same time in 2020. The number of new housing starts has been flirting with the 1.6 million mark since the beginning of 2021, making an accurate prediction around this specific number difficult. According to the website ipropertymanagement.com (2021), 2020 saw 1.4 million new housing starts while the last 12 months from the time of this writing has seen the threshold number of 1.6 million. Being as this represents 95.2% of the total number of issued housing permits, an extremely high number, fluctuation is extremely possible and could result in the actual amount for October falling on either side of the line. Despite this, my prediction is that the U.S. will see a continued upward trend in new housing starts, passing the 1.6 million barrier but remaining significantly south of the nest 1.8 million threshold. I place the confidence level of this prediction at 90%, with the remaining 10% allocated to the more conservative estimate of between 1.4 and 1.6 million."

There was a 3.93% increase in housing starts in August, after a decrease in July that was preceded by three months of continued increases. Given that many of the factors affecting the housing market have remained in a fairly consistent range since the last reported housing starts, I believe housing starts for October will remain in that range. I believe the end of coronavirus relief (eviction moratorium and unemployment), the slightly increasing mortgage rate (consistently above 3% since 9/17/2021), and ongoing material + labor shortages will prevent the October rate from exceeding 1.799 million. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest housing starts dropping below 1.4 million."

At this point, I feel like I now know even less. With that said, here is the old college try. I think there is a 60% chance of housing starts staying between 1.4 million and 1.6 million inclusive. The market as of right now, and as the short synopsis suggest, is being widely affected by lumber shortages and other shortages with other materials. There is also the factor of labor shortages as of right now. While new single family units and homes will continue to be built, I don’t see any sign of a massive proliferation any time soon nor a decline. I think it will stay stagnant. As for less or more, the housing market, especially as it applies to new build has a volatility of its own. Therefore I’m scoring it for 20% less and 20% for more. The state of the economy however I believe will deter a number of people away from building as the cost may not outweigh the risk. With that said, there still appears to be proliferation of younger people moving to the suburbs. That could cause a slight influx but that remains to be seen and the dead line for this prediction is fast approaching with no real definitive movement going either up or down.

The increased BAH rates affected service members took effect on 1 October and will expire on 31 December 2021 (defense.gov). Mike Fratantoni, the chief economist for the Mortgage Banker Association, stated, “Builders are also reporting difficulty obtaining other inputs like appliances, and these supply-chain constraints are holding back a housing market that should otherwise be picking up speed, given the strong demand for buying fueled by an improving job market and low mortgage rates” (Olick, 2021). BAH factors are a solid indicator of the housing market; along with past statistical data and pandemic factors, the annualized rate will likely fall between 1.4 million and 1.6 million inclusive (50%), and more than 1.6 million but less than 1.8 million (50%) (moderate confidence)."

There seems to be a sort of trend where units typically increase in October, only for it to begin significant declines by December. From a more historical perspective, almost every 10 years from 1960 there has been at least one sharp spike in decline. Further elaborating on this, the only decline lower than the 10 year decline cycle occurred in October-1966 between 1960 to 1970. However, in between these 10 years, typically 2-5, there are significant rises in units. The only time this decline didn't occur in the 10 year cycle didn't occur was between 1990 to 2000. What's even more interesting about the years after 1990 is how the graph becomes consistent. Unlike the years prior to 1990, the grap shows a start contrast in fluctuations. But the years after 1990 shows great consistency before plummeting. To support this, from 2000 to 2010, a massive spike occurred. A spike that hit 478, a number far lower than any decline in the past 50 years prior before 2010. But from 2010, there was yet again another decline on April 2020, but only after having a smooth rise just like the years between 1990 and 2000."

What is a seasonally adjusted annual rate? Most of the seasonally adjusted series are shown as seasonally adjusted annual rates (SAAR). The seasonally adjusted annual rate is the seasonally adjusted monthly value multiplied by 12. The benefit of the annual rate is that not only can one monthly estimate be compared with another; monthly data can also be compared with an annual total. The seasonally adjusted annual rate is neither a forecast nor a projection; rather it is a description of the rate of building permits, housing starts, housing completions, or new home sales in the particular month for which they are calculated. url source: https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/faqs/faqs_nrc_release.html Using data from https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf, and https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/housing-starts to demonstrate the 2021 historical adjustments in the seasonally adjusted annual rate per month to provide as accurate a prediction as possible for October 2021. September 2021 demonstrated a 3.9% SAAR moving up from 1.55 million to 1.615 million and August 2021 had a -7% and an overall trend line including Oct 2020 to Oct 2021 projecting a starting value directly below 1.65 million, approximately 1.648 million an increase of approximately .97% on current trend. Other trends continuing to January of 2021 to exclude atypical fluctuations due to COVID-19 complications shows an overall moderate increase with 3 month fluctuations which even in 2021 are a product of COVID-19 events both in restrictions and limited production but also in subsidies, job market recovery initiatives, a year plus of employment providers utilizing online platforms and growing them for productivity’s sake, and government action specifically designed to improve economic conditions. These factors have combined to allow increases in the SAAR and though October 21 would indicate a negative month, by microtrend, the overall initiatives targeting the balancing of the US housing sector should provide an overall improving trend for Oct ’21 though the overall trend of gradual gains/losses would indicate a marginal gain for Oct ’21 as the most likely event. The likelihood of positive trends continuing into November and December 21 for the US SAAR is unlikely both historically and practically as weather changes and a majority of the US is affected by inclimate weather housing changes become less and common during winter months. https://time.com/nextadvisor/mortgages/best-time-to-buy-a-home/"

Also, as the U.S. is on an upward recover from the pandemic, there is a likely chance that the housing market and economy will be steady making a probable outcome that housing starts will stay around 1.6 million. Lumber prices are a factor as well to housing starts, which in July, lumber was at its lowest price. This resulted in more housing starts in August. As of Oct 1st, lumber prices are in a slight incline which could lower housing starts but its marginal, which it will stay close to 1.6 million.

This increase of housing starts is likely to increase for September as the price for lumber continues to drop and get back to a more average price for lumber. Climate plays a big part how people spend money. Most people would think building a new house makes more sense in the spring/summer time frame, but as the numbers have shown, even with an increase in price of lumber, the numbers for July are down. I contribute this to a reciprocal thought, where the average house takes 9 months to build. Let's say October for instance, you lay the foundation and 9 months later (June/July) your house is complete. This allows parents with children the ability to move in when the weather is good and school is out of session. This forecast may change slightly after the September numbers are released on 19OCT."
