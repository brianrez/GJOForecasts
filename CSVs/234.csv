The incumbent, Spanberger (D) took the lead and this race seemingly hasn't been close since. In politics, however, memories are short. 538 still gives Spanberger a 72% chance of winning--but that's down 10% from just a week ago. And Cook recently downgraded this race from lean Democrat to toss-up. Averaging the aggregators and the forecasters favors Spanberger roughly 65-45, but if Cook downgraded this, then I'm assuming something is happening on the ground in this election in addition to the sudden change in momentum favoring Republicans nationwide. Using Cook as a kind of canary in the coal mine, I'm putting this one at 60-40 Spanberger, with a distinct possibility of getting even closer."

Youngkin (R) won this district 55-44% in 2021's Governor election but before that Spanberger (D) won by a close 50.9 to 49.1 in 2020 and an even closer 50.3 to 48.4 in 2018. Youngkin seems a non-traditional R that was able to sway some D voters, so the 11% victory might not be indicative of an overall swing. Youngkin's approval rating in the state is on the lower end right now at ~40-45% as well which might mean he isn't able to rally support for the congressional election. The redistricting won't take place until 2023, so it won't impact this election. Biden's approval rating is pretty low across the country, but I wasn't able to find specific polls in VA-7. It seems this race will come down to a vote of confidence in Biden. Leaning in favor of R given the Youngkin victory recently, tight margins the last 4 years, low Biden approval rating, decent Youngkin approval rating and no apparent issues with Spanberger. Note that it is possible Spanberger isn't the D candidate and I don't believe there is a clear R candidate yet, both of which could have an impact as we get closer."
