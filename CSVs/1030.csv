Current Crowd Forecast is 1% chance, will use as my initial probability. Attribution to a cyberattack is also difficult. Attack would have to be acknowledged, and made public. Attack may or may not be attributed to a specific country, group, or source. Attribution to a country has huge political implications. Non-attribution to a source gives appearance of incompetence. Even if NYSE is attacked and shutdown, this could be hidden. It could be attributed to glitch or error, and not an attack. Current financial and geopolitical instability from COVID-19 makes things more tense, slightly increases chances for attack."

1639,2020-01-12T18:12:25Z,1,[3.0],[3.0],"A cyberwar with Iran is highly possible. Iran may have fewer restraints than other American adversaries like Russia, North Korea, or China, leading to attacks that are both “aggressive and unpredictable - to the point of being reckless.” Tehran is likely to lean on its proxy forces, including Hezbollah and Hamas, to effectively launch a full-scale attack. Critical infrastructures like power grids and the financial system have long been seen as ripe targets for cyber warfare, but Iran may look to the Russian playbook, to focus any offensive campaign on President Trump himself, conducting influence operations including meddling in the upcoming U.S. Presidential election. The U.S. government has increased cyber capabilities dramatically over the years, Defense Department’s tools against any attack are unmatched, but the U.S. remains vulnerable in part because it doesn’t impose the kind of control Iran does over the internet. BUT: To halt the NYSE from now to August 2020 seems unlikely, also considering that the damage inflicted on a Cyberattack to NYSE may be limited and it will be very unlikely that NYSE will make it public before this date. I gave a 3% because NYSE had quite a few cyberattacks in the past. Thank you @Japon for the interesting links shared!"

If such an attack were to occur again, it seems very unlikely it would result in a cross-market trading halt. But Iran does seem to have significantly strengthened its cyber capabilities [5] since then, so by now they might be capable of more powerful attacks - though I still think a cross-market trading halt would be unlikely because A) they still might not be capable of it and B) it is overwhelmingly likely that retaliatory Iranian cyber attack(s) will instead strike at other targets."

A solo hacker (someone weighing 400 lbs sitting on his bed) is unlikely. Which foreign governments would want to cyber attack? The obvious ones are North Korea, Russia and Iran. There might be a few others, but I can't think of them right now. North Korea would be by far the most likely. They cyber hacked Sony when they did not like a movie so they probably have the ability but why would they? Why do they launch missiles and develop nuclear weapons? I suspect because they want to be a player on the world stage without entering into a self-destructive war. A cyber attack would do just that. Russian likely would not do such a thing as long as their favorite president was in the White House and afterward probably would not want the resulting post-attack sanctions. Next, Iran would. They attacked Saudi Arabia recently with drones. Iran hates us, but they probably do not have the ability and would likely attack a greater Satan first, e.g., Saudi Arabia or Kuwait."

There have been a few times when technical glitches [1] or geopolitical events [2] brought trading to a halt, but these were not related to cyberattacks. There have, however, been smaller-scale cyber attacks on stock exchanges across the globe, with one report finding that about half of exchanges were the target of cyber attacks in a given year [3]."
