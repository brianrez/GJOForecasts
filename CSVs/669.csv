Other than Wisconsin, every state appears to have met the safe harbor deadline, which means Congress has to accept the electoral votes that will be cast next week and sent to the Capitol for counting on Jan. 6. Those votes will elect Biden as the country’s next president ... Missing the deadline won’t deprive Wisconsin of its 10 electoral votes. Biden electors still will meet in Madison on Monday to cast their votes and there’s no reason to expect that Congress won’t accept them. In any case, Biden would still have more than the 270 votes he needs even without Wisconsin’s."" https://apnews.com/article/safe-harbor-law-locks-congress-joe-biden-119b6e1570f33af0baee1493cbbe012b"

529,2020-10-16T17:03:04Z,1,[1.0],[1.0],"(Initial forecast:) A long-shot (nightmare-) scenario even for 2020 (+ beyond). But primarily because current polling + political forecasting indicates that Donald Trump likely will not be strongly competitive in 2020's Electoral College. Election prognosticators would need to be almost completely wrong, and/or an unforeseen 'black swan' event (somehow 'favoring' Trump) suddenly impacts the U.S. election."

This race is largely between only two candidates and one seems to have a widening, significant lead over the other in polls as of now. I think the odds of one party not getting the required 131 electoral votes is slim."

States have tightened up their rules on the timing of the steps leading up to the electoral college, rules regarding the counting of mail in ballots, and challenge procedures and deadlines. State courts will have ample means to support whatever judbement they make, if it comes to that. Any federal appeal will ultimately go to SCOTUS and regardless of whichever party is the appeallant SCOTUS will be consistent with this is a State issue and just be consistent in your application of processes."
