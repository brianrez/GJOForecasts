CNY remains a managed currency but all such currencies come with jump risk. Although a stronger renminbi would be broadly beneficial to the transition from investment to consumption, this is currently a secondary objective. Significant appreciation from here is hard to see although it would not be out of character for the authorities to attempt to penalise the crowded shorts and create an impression of being in full control. That aside, a gradual depreciation is the most likely scenario in the near term. A major controlled one-off depreciation to try to put the issue in the past is possible (although it would require a trigger), while an uncontrolled breakdown is less likely in the near term. From 6.60 to 6.80 is not a major move for a free-floating currency but it would be a major move for CNY. NB the question refers to CNY (as per bloomberg link), not CNH."

This will prevent the dollar from surging, which puts pressure on the RMB. The CCP wants a stable exchange rate, and has tools to keep the currency stable. They can achieve their goal if the Fed doesn't do much in the way of higher interest rates this year. With 5 months to go, stability of the exchange rate seems to be the best bet."

Volatility has picked up quite a bit since January 2014, however we can see that the currency is still tightly controlled. After a relatively rapid appreciation of 0.47% per month against the US Dollar, the CNY appreciated at a much slower pace from May 2010 to January 2014, at about 0.27% per month. What's most interesting to me is that since the CNY began depreciating in January of 2014, the pace of depreciation has been almost exactly the same 0.27% per month. It is quite likely that the Chinese government is comfortable with this pace of depreciation and are very likely to stick to it despite what market commentators or other countries might say (as evidenced in their management of the CNY appreciation from 2005 to 2013). Extrapolating out 6.633 months at that same rate gives us an expected value of 6.61 for the CNY at 30 September. The thing that might change the pace of this rate is a more pronounced weakening in the local economy. Over the past couple of years the CNY has actually appreciated significantly against many of its trading partners as emerging market and developed Asia currencies as well as the EUR have sold off against the Dollar between 15 and 35%. Volatility in global markets may also hasten the depreciation if the Dollar continues to strengthen. My expected value for the CNY is right at the 6.6 break point, however, it appears that the forces favoring a more rapid depreciation are prevailing. A depreciation past 6.8 seems unlikely, as that would mean an almost 5% move. With the way the 3% adjustment in August impacted markets, the Chinese government will probably not want to use that option unless the situation is particularly dire."
