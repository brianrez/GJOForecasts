As a next idea, I found a 2018 movie awards dataset via BigML then used a machine learning algorithm (LightGBM) with a model explainer algorithm (SHAP) to identify what factors influenced award winners. Basically, metacritic reviews, gross revenue and duration were the key drivers. Genres such as drama and biography also played a small minor part. I didn't use gross revenue as part of the base rate calculation since I feel that it is become less relevant with streaming services. I weighted metacritic reviews (eg. aggregated reviews via rotten tomatoes and imbd) as 90% and duration as 10%. I then combined my values with crowd forecasts to give the final predictions. If I were to make improvements, I would watch all the movies myself and mark them against a criteria and/or put in the effort to make an actual AI driven predictor."

The Irishman is very good, 'classic Scorsese', and it was great fun seeing Pacino, De Niro, and Pesci in one film...but drama wise, it was a bit staid and over-long for mass appeal. Marriage Story has gotten a good bit of buzz and press (though I don't think that many people have seen it, comparatively)...and, it seems a bit boring (but I have not seen it). Competing with The Irishman and 1917, I don't think it can stand up. Same with Two Popes."
