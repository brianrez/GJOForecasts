Does not fit the bill, I cannot get my head around it, but my prediction is too obvious to my mind (and I am more pro EU than not, fitting, huh?), hence the pounding in my head ;-) ...and I know the tricks our minds play on ourselves, regardless of ourselves.

67411,2019-05-23T06:26:09Z,6,[5.0],[-15.0],"Adjusting: I strengthen my prediction that the voter turnout in the election of EU Parliament will not set a record low. One reason is time period as it is only a couple days left until election, the likelihood that something highly unexpected will happen and impact the voters’ participation is very limited. Second, as UK is one of the biggest countries in the EU, its people participation has a huge impact towards the final turnout of the EU election. Also, as it was mentioned in the previous analysis, British usually have one of the lowest turnout in the EU election. Even though, in opposite when I assumed, Britain will take part in EU elections, it does not increase the likelihood of lowest turnout. Responding to many British people “mood”, the EU election this year has a bigger weight than any previous ones. Lots of people the participation in it see as one more EU referendum and a chance to show for, firstly, Britain politicians that they want to stay in EU. Based on previous arguments, I assume that the voters’ turnout will not be the lowest."

However, this will not be the case as Denmark's general election will be held on July 5th. It was the hypothesis that joined elections would boost a slumping voter turnout, as it would bring voters who are otherwise not engaged with the EU to the voting booths. Hence, Denmark's participation rate will likely not increase as predicted. In my initial prediction, I also assumed that the UK would not be partaking in the EU elections, but it is shaping up to be one more British EP election. Normally, voter turnout in the UK has been lover than the average European participation, but it has been suggested that the current Brexit chaos will bring out voters from both the ‘remain’ and the ‘hard-Brexit’ side will participate in increased numbers to showcase their respective feelings about UK’s continued involvement with the EU. Potentially, if voter turnout increases significantly, the UK participation could add positively to the overall voter participation. Overall, surveys have shown that 48% of European citizens believe that 'their voice counts in the EU', which is an increase from past years. Yet, only 43 % of eligible voters respond that they are certain that they will vote. This is not an immediate increase from past years’ participation, however, the increased commitment to EU could indicate that participation will not continue its free-fall. This is supported by the reports that an increasing amount of European citizens report that they consider their European identity as important as their national identity. On the basis of the above, I still believe that the elections will not set a record low, however, I keep probability at 15%."

They have historically had below-average voter turn-outs, and this was a consideration in earlier forecasts which had expected that the UK would not participate in the EU Parliamentary election. However, given the current political climate in the UK and public discontent with Brexit, it does seem probable that more will head to the polling booths to have their say (for one last time). That being said, and the reason for the slight increase in this forecast, these is also the possibility that Brits refrain from voting, knowing that Brexit is looming, which could bring down the EU-wide average."
67448,2019-05-07T11:29:19Z,2,[15.0],[-20.0],"Update: I have decided to decrease my percentage to 15% since the last forecast was made. Simply put, this decrease is due to the fact that I believe the European people this election have more to vote for compared to previous elections. Seeing as several of the EU state have parties running on the basis of leaving the EU following the sparks made by Brexit, the rise of populist parties all across the continent, local and international debates about topics like climate change and immigration, it is in my opinion expected that people will have a stronger incentive to take to the polls. With the added campaigns posted by the EU, I find it likely that voter turnout will not be at an all time low."

This will surely affect turnout by Labour Party Members and supporters for the EU Parliamentary Elections. The Labour position is that it will support a Public Vote on a Conservative version of Brexit, but will not support a Public Vote on a Labour version of Brexit. I don't know if Labour voters will have spotted the logic of this. A Conservative version of Brexit could only pass the UK Parliament if the Conservative Government was able to get a majority of MPs to back it. If a majority of MPs had just voted thru a Conservative version of Brexit those same MPs would hardly be likely to then vote to first hold a Public Vote on the deal that they have voted for. If the Government had got its Brexit Bill thru Parliament the UK would leave the EU, which means it would be too late to hold a Public Vote on it. If somehow the Conservative Government could be persuaded to support a Labour version of Brexit and there was a majority of MPs who would vote for it, then according to the Labour Policy there would be no need to have a Public Vote. So a ""Conservative"" version of Brexit would be opposed by Labour, who would demand a Public Vote. If there were enough MPs to vote it thru it would not matter what Labour demanded because it would be passed anyway without a Public Vote. If there were not enough MPs to to pass the Consevative version of Brexit it would not happen and so no Public Vote is needed. So in short the Labour policy is pointless because Labour would never have the number of MPs to demand a Public Vote on a Conservative version of Brexit that was able to pass in parliament. As 2/3 of Labour voters support Remain, and up to 80% of Labour members are in favour of a Public Vote on any Brexit deal, the cunning plan by the Labour leadership to try and appeal to Leavers by saying they would like to push thru a Labour version of Brexit, and to appeal to Remainers by saying that it might be possible to avoid Brexit by having a Public Vote on a Conservative Brexit, does not really work. Many of Labour Leave voters might have been happy with the Conservative Brexit, which Labour is ruling out. And most of the Labour Remain voters will be upset because Labour is ruling out stopping Brexit. So its clear that few Labour voters would get what they want, so why would they bother to vote for Labour candidates for the EU Parliamentory Elections? Their logical choice is to vote for a party that clearly supports Brexit or a party that clearly supports Remain or to refrain from voting at all."

This election will be the first EP vote since the Brexit referendum, and engagement with the Union has become a more prominently featured topic in both local governance and the news media. Initially while trying to answer this question, I was tempted to pull data from local elections, such as those in Italy and France, that indicate that despite a rise in more populist candidates voter engagement has continued to slide. However, these elections have a much different focus than MEP elections and the interests in one do not necessarily translate over to another. Further, as a general trend the decline in voter turnout itself has declined in more recent elections: That is to say the margin by which elections have less turnout than the prior EP election is shrinking. With these combined factors, it appears highly likely that if any year would be the year for an upset, it would be 2019. http://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/in-the-past/previous-elections https://www.idea.int/data-tools/world-view/40?st=eup#rep https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-02-25/italy-voters-stay-home-as-turnout-on-pace-for-lowest-since-wwii https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/french-election-turnout-emmanuel-macron-parliament-france-victory-fn-marine-le-pen-national-front-a7785366.html"

I think that this event could be interpreted in two opposite ways. On one side, would be likely for the Britain people who voted for the “leave” to practice abstentionism, in order to reiterate their position. This would cause a drop in Uk participation rate, influencing the whole European rate. On the other side, the people that voted for the “stay” will participate to the elections, included all the citizens that in the past might not show such an active participation to European election, increasing the rate. However, I believe the first factor is more influent than the second one, so I think it will drop the Uk EU elections participation rate (or, in the best case, keep it equal to the 2014 one), not increasing it. - In some European countries the parties that during the electoral campaign were claiming to get out from Europe or from Euro now are reconsidering their idea, because reality is always more complicated and implies more (bad) consequences than any populist slogan. Italian example: suddenly, the Lega leader Salvini proclaims that he wants to change the EU from the inside, not destroying it anymore. His declaration make me think that a lot of Italian will prefer to follow their ”””captain””” and vote for him also in the European campaign instead of not voting at all. --> this is why I’m going to change my prediction of only 5%"

The average percentage of participation had reached its peak (61,99%) in 1979, going down in 1984 (58,98), 1989 (58,41%), 1994 (56,67%) until the huge breakdown in 1999 at 49,51%. In 2004 it reached 45,57% and 42,97% in 2009. In the last 2014 elections the result have been the worst, with an attendance of only 42,61%, but very similar to the 2009 results which doesn’t make me forecast a huger declining. https://www.wired.it/attualita/politica/2014/05/23/elezioni-europee-affluenza/ http://www.europarl.europa.eu/elections2014-results/en/election-results-2014.html The lower and lower turnout level could be due to a lack of efficiency and action power perceived by the populations, especially after/during episodes like the economic crisis in 2008 and the refugee crisis. In my view, a huge role is played by the populist anti-European parties that have raised in the last decade in Europe, spread everywhere and founded consensus at the national elections. Those parties have often depicted EU as an enemy that would cared more of bureaucracy and elites than to common lay people, spreading angriness, dissatisfaction and disappointment. Moreover, the recent Brexit referendum and the rise to power of similar movements in other big countries (Trump in USA, Bolsonaro in Brasil), have somehow legitimised those positions. However, after having hit bottom in 2009 and 2014, I think that this year turnout wouldn’t reach the historical minimums. Even the EU does not good well yet, currently there aren’t emergency situation such as in 2009 or 2014. What I forecast instead is a massive flow of votes for anti-European parties: instead of not voting at all, the populations would prefer to vote them aiming to change EU from the inside and asking their politicians to “take back national sovereignty”, even stopping the process of integration (which already had a setback after Lisbon treaty in 2009, with no more structural treaties). “While there are significant divides between them on substance, anti-European parties could align with one another tactically in support of a range of ideas: from abolishing sanctions on Russia to blocking the EU’s foreign trade agenda, to pulling the drawbridge up against migration. This would put at risk Europe’s capacity to defend its citizens from external threats at exactly the time when, given global turmoil, it needs to show more resolve, cooperation, and global leadership.” https://www.ecfr.eu/specials/scorecard/the_2019_European_election On the other side, the pro-Europe citizens would feel the urgency of contrasting the rise of euro-sceptics, going to vote for the opposition. Talking about the Brexit issue, there is evidence of the complexity of getting out from EU without suffering bad consequences and of the fact that EU has un upper hand on the topic. This discourage the idea of leaving the Union and empower EU credibility. Additionally, a lot of countries are going to vote for National elections at the same time of European ones, pushing citizens to vote for both. Finally, EU is doing a massive campaign to teach the youngest electors the importance of European policies, using modern path as youtube, social media, bloggers support. These actions will likely increase the number of voters in elections. Therefore, I predict a low level of participation but not the lowest."

This difference is rather small and considered too small for this forecast to anticipate a further decrease based upon that, in particular given the fact that the long-term downwards trend (almost 20% between 1979 and 2014) got promoted (among other factors) strongly by the expansion of the EU toward the east where voter turnout has been traditionally lower than in the western countries (https://www.kas.de/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=d3b13d4c-81ad-5926-f2eb-d41cbc81f95b&groupId=252038 and https://blog.datawrapper.de/weekly-chart-turnout/).

In case of an extension of Article 50, the UK still has a right to hold an election. However, it is very unlikely that the UK would decide to use it. Therefore, taking into account that the UK's turnout is always below the EU average, it could also increase the overall percentage of participation. 4.

Therefore, I believe that the European Parliament will be working a lot more than in years previous, to increase turnout. Secondly, the trend seems to have slowed from 2009 to 2014 election. Thirdly, since the last European Parliament elections, there has been a lot of attention on the Eu and its importance due to Brexit. Many in Europe, believe the EU to be a benefit and are grateful that they are not going through an exit. Therefore, they feel more sympathetic towards the EU, increasing the likelihood that they'll vote. Moreover, on the other side, Brexit will energize those citizens who do want to exit the EU.

Recently though the EU has taken a great step in promoting the EU and getting awareness with the younger generation. Programs such as the 'thistimeimvoting.eu' campaign are very visible on online platforms, or the hashtag #EUandME has been introduced, creating more awareness among the 'Social-media generation'. Also for the elections now, the EU is taking an effort, e.g. recruiting popular bloggers to promote the EU elections.

Actually not because, as Politico notes, the European Parliament and European Commission are planning to spend more than €30 million on ""get out the vote"" advertising and support (which is likely to have only a little impact on the willingness of European citizens to vote). Rather, a number of considerations led me to this conclusion:"

Having 42% of all voters showing up, thus, means that 84% of the people interested in the election will actually vote, which would be highly optimistic. While it is true that some issues, such as climate change and (above all) managing migrants flows motivate people to vote, it is also true that policies on such issues are still mostly implemented according to national legislation, and that the EU has been doing little, if anything, to help solving them. This is precisely what leads to feelings of high skepticism and mistrust towards EU institutions."

With that being said, the European Parliament has for this election put in extra effort to make sure that the voting turnout does not set a record low, with their campaign called 'This Time I'm Voting' (https://www.thistimeimvoting.eu/), providing EU citizens with extensive information about how and where to vote, as well as information about where to vote in the respective countries. This leads me to believe that the voting turnout will stay at around the same number, but that the likelihood is not as high as if the European Parliament had not started their new campaigns."

European countries are too small to tackle them by their own. On the same time the populist parties are shifting tactics towards EU. They are not longer trying to get out of the EU (Altinget, 2019) - Brexit proves it being economically and politically costly. But they want to reform the EU from the inside, so the anti EU parties alongside the pro EU parties would try to gather their support and encourage their supporters to vote. In that sense I think the second order the of EU elections mechanism would not play big role this time and perhaps in the future.

There could be a 45% probability of a record low in the turnouts, driven by the growth of populist parties. Also, the second-order nature the EU elections have in comparison with national elections can be important: with the European migration crisis and the uncertain developments in the Brexit deal can drive people to a lower attention to communitarian issues. Another outcome is more probable, in my opinion. There could be a 50% probability that the voters' turnout will be not meaningfully decreased in comparison with the 42.61% of the 2014 elections. This can be explained through multiple factors. The very increase of populist parties in Europe does not necessarily imply a lower turnout in the European elections, it could also lead to a wider representation of these parties in the EU Parliament. Furthermore, as often European elections are used by electors to give their national leaders signs about their satisfaction/dissatisfaction with their internal politics, many voters can seize the oportunity to give a clear message. If this outcome will happen, there is a strong risk of misleading interpretations: the stable turnout - far from being a good sign - must not be explained with a revival of the European belonging feeling, but with the previous explanations. The reasons which explain the 45% probability of a lower turnout are also the ones which explain the reason why I give only a 5% probability to a higher torunout. I cannot exclude a surprise - a record Italian turnout to support the Lega in its migrations policies, a record UK's turnout deriving from an unsuccesfull Brexit process, etc - but I am not induced to thik that the historical decreasing pattern of participation will end in 2019.

Firstly, in response to the low voter turnout in 2014, the EU initiated the ‘this time I am voting campaign’ to increase awareness about EU elections and mobilize voter participation all across Europe (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/elections-press-kit/2/this-time-i-m-voting) . Secondly, the EU has featured as a major talking point across different European countries in the light of events such as Brexit and border closings. This could mean an increased interest in the EU and its work, whether as a supporter or a skeptic, and thereby an increased interest for potential voters to participate in EU elections (https://www.euronews.com/2019/02/12/european-election-2019-this-time-will-be-different). Moreover, the EU elections will be held in conjunction with local and regional elections in both Ireland and Spain, which could secure, and potentially increase, and already above-average voter turnout in these two countries (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/in-the-past/previous-elections). The UK will most likely not be voting in the European election, even if they were to extend the notification of article 50 (https://www.ft.com/content/901f95fe-1a70-11e9-9e64-d150b3105d2). As the UK voter turnout has been on the lower side, the overall average voter turnout will be positively influenced by this absence. However, there is still a chance that despite these variables, the voter turnout will continue its downward trend, and I therefore assign a 15% probability of that happening."

If I do not necessarily expect to see a substantially higher participation rate, I personally doubt that it can supplant the 42.61% of 2014."
67418,2019-02-23T21:37:31Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],"85% of No Even though we are witnessing a slow decline in the participation rate since 1979, going from a rate of 61.99% to 42.61% in 2014, however since 2009, it seems to have been a stabilization when the decline was 42.97%,with a decrease of 0.36% in 2014. The recent events and the current European context will surely boost the participation rate. Indeed, the European Union is very questioned, but this state of affairs will not push towards abstention. On the contrary, eurosceptics through a protest vote will manifest this position very strongly. Eurosceptic partys take the vote more seriously than partys with a broader base. The Hungarian populists (turnout of 28.97% in Hungary) and Polish (turnout of 23.83% in Poland in 2014) will try to have a bigger place in the parliament and will therefore encourage their voters, always more numerous from day to day, to support them to overturn the pro-eu majority in the Parliament. Italians too will have a greater desire to express themselves with the advent of Salvini. The protest voting theory also shows that voters use peripheral polls to punish the holders of central power in the home country (Mair 2004)."

It will likely start campaigning heavily. However currently seeing no sign for this yet. Reasons in favor: • Voter turnout for the European union has been in decline since 1984, with a record low in 2014 ((https://www.politico.eu/interactive/voters-turnout-in-the-european-elections/)) • Patterns of increased euro-skepticism, combined with brexit, show decline in belief of the EU, and why vote for something you don't believe in in the first place. (https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2017/monitor2017/a_crisis_of_confidence_in_the_european_union/) • Unclarity regarding the Brexit procedures likely increases the disbelief in the EU Overall: I think the purely statistical advantage of Brexit is outweighed by the increase of Euro-skepticism and will dampen the Voter turnout further. Only increased campaigning can offset this."

The latest Eurobarometer survey supports this general trend and for instance shows increasing voter interest in EU policies and an increase in likelihood of wanting to vote (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/at-your-service/files/be-heard/eurobarometer/2018/eurobarometer-2018-democracy-on-the-move/report/en-one-year-before-2019-eurobarometer-report.pdf).

I can't speak for all European countries, but in Germany, voter turnout increased in all recent state and national elections, presumably due to the rise of the far right party which mobilised people who would not previously have voted, but on the other hand also people who would make sure to vote to counter the far right. I would argue that particularly in the more populous countries of Europe, politics have been very tumultous, or extreme, in the past few or couple of years, which means people in general are perhaps more aware and talking about politics than they would have a few years ago, and due to Brexit the same may be the case for EU politics. This may mean that more people have opinions on the EU and will bother to vote. So I doubt that voter turnout will be a record low, however, given an overall frustration with politics and/or the EU, feeling that the vote wouldn't matter, and lack of relatedness to the EU parliament, pariticularly in Eastern European countries, could still mean that a substantial number of people don't bother to vote."

If we take that UK population is 13% of EU and do some quick math turnout for countries that are staying in EU was 43.65 and would need to decline by more than 1% vs 2014 to set new record low. Also as Brexit is on headlines everywhere I believe it is going to encourage people to vote regardless if they like EU or not. One threat to above analysis is extending Brexit negotiations in the way that UK takes part in elections but leaves at the end of the year. I am not sure if such scenario is even possible but it would be game changer as UK turnout would be record low for sure."
