There's still also the theoretical possibility that Johnson and his government will find a way to circumvent the Benn Act and make the withdrawal happen by the deadline.

The first avenue is itself blocked: the opposition and those MPs willing to align themselves with the opposition, cannot coalesce behind any leader: Corbyn is unacceptable and will not stand down, and the SNP & LibDems are too small, and there is a question about having the SNP lead the government of the United Kingdom when its goal is to leave it. Legally, a vote of no confidence would not immediately result in a general election and so the only way to force a rapid change of government would be to vote on an early day motion (EDM), which would be a vote of confidence in a specific individual, and so we get back to the leadership question the opposition has. The Benn Act, then, to my mind, is the last stand against No Deal. I have looked at John Major's notion that the government could get round the Benn Act through an order in council, but i think the whole business unlikely and even the government has dismissed the idea -which could be through sand in our eyes, but to what end? There are a few loopholes in the Benn Act: if parliament agrees to a deal, then the government is absolved of its responsibility to send a letter requesting an extension. The other loophole is that the Prime Minister must accept an extension according to the parameters detailed in his letter, which requests an extension till January 31 2020. In other words, if the European Council proposed an extension outside of this date, the Prime Minister need not accept the extension. More on this here: https://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2019/09/13/oliver-garner-the-benn-burt-extension-act-a-roadblock-to-a-no-deal-brexit/. There is the possibility of some nation, like Hungary, vetoing an extension request, but judging by Juncker and Varadkar's statements, this is extremely unlikely considering the nations most affected by Brexit -France, Germany, etc- have little incentive to veto an extension, this would imply a country like Hungary acting against the interests of France and Germany... The government could simply throw its toys out of the pram and veto key decisions and make itself such a nuisance the EU vetoes an extension request, but with only a week left, that would be quite a tantrum. Finally, civil servants are obliged to follow the law and if they perceive the government to be breaking the law, they may simply not co-operate in enforcing its will. All this rambling leads me to think that the Prime Minister is attempting to drive a bus through the eye of a needle. There is a gulf between rhetoric and reality and I keep asking myself: if Boris Johnson could get round the Benn Act, why has he not announced how he will do it? In 2019, leaks are inevitable, and yet, nothing... Boris Johnson cannot remain Prime Minister, uphold the law and exit on 31 Oct. 2019."

Johnson bluster has had its day and a ""No Deal"" brexit is virtually impossible unless one of the EU member states basically said, ""Go now."" Fourthly. There is a vague chance that ""ultra-right"" English and NI politicians will actually wake up to the absolute reality of a total collapse of the UK & NI as a nation state in the event of a ""no deal""."
79399,2019-09-13T20:52:05Z,1,[66.0],[66.0],"This is based on a number of factors. The Government are clear that they will obey the law but also state they will leave deal or no deal. The recent Benn/Letwin bill would seem to mitigate against them being able to leave without a deal. Yet still the Government state they will leave deal or no deal. In a recent interview Dominic Rabb the foreign secretary stated that the benn/Letwin legislation would be legally tested to the limits. This suggests they think they have a legal route around this. There is also the fact that any request to extend would require unanimous support from EU countries. Will France carry out its threat to veto any extension and let the uk crash out, probably not. One possible route is that no deal emerges from the EU summit. On or around 17 October, Johnson resigns, meaning 14 days to find a new PM. However my understanding is that for the queen to appoint a successor, requires a recommendation from the PM. He could state that there is no successor, 14 days elapse and then there is a general election and we crash out. Also I cannot see how Corbyn could muster the votes to become PM. The Lib Dem’s, Independent Group and most of the Independents would refuse to back him. The remainders know what they are against not what they are for and their fragile working together is unlikely to last long. Another route is that some deal does emerge from the Eu summit. A number of labour MPs are already moving towards accepting a deal any deal after previously voting against Theresa May’s deals. 31 October has the feel of a real deadline and the pressure will be on to agree a deal. My final argument is that both sides have war gamed all scenarios. I have more faith in the Governments war gaming than the oppositions. They did after all win the original referendum against all the odds. Finally I can’t believe that after waiting all this time that Boris will want to go down without getting this done. He has staked everything on this."

It is extremely unlikely that Art 50 will be revoked by 31 Oct. Due to the new law passed Boris will have to ask for an extension unless a withdrawal agreement or a no deal exit is agreed by the UK Parliament by 19 Oct. Boris really does not want to ask for an extension. Many in his cabinet (himself and Gove included) would like to leave with a deal. There is very little time left for negotiating with the EU. Now that the government is no longer reliant on the DUP for a majority (even with the DUP they are a minority) they may consider being more flexible with regard to a border in the Irish Sea. So it is not unlikely that an amended version of Theresa May's withdrawal agreement will be put before Parliament once the new session begins. The question is, will the opposition vote with the government for a deal, or will the MPs who want to remain/leave with no deal/have another referendum hold out in the hope of eventually getting what they want, possibly after an early general election."
