For one, there is currently a labor shortage as the result of social preferences shifting in both younger and older populations over the past twelve months that appears unlikely to correct in a manner which would appear favorable towards labor force participation rate growth beyond this 63% threshold. Additionally, states which can hold back this rate overall such as NY and California - due to their large populations in major urban metros - appear to favor providing social assistance to residents who do not wish to return to work, which will further deter individuals from seeking employment in cases where benefits exceed minimum wage rates or salaries paid for their skill level or occupation (income levels which may potentially comprise a large swath of labor force in these areas)."

Most shocks are going to slow down the labor force recovery, so significant downside. Lots of ways to fall off the trend which puts us above 63.0."
100715,2021-06-02T13:33:49Z,1,[64.0],[64.0],"There are a lot of factors at work here that could result in the rate going either way in the next seven months. A major factor is inflation. We are already seeing inflation ticking up as a result of over stimulation of state and federal cash transfers and spending. As a result, there is a lot of pent up money out there without anything to purchase and supply restraints. One of two things could happen. That pent up money begins flooding the market, resulting in companies increasing hiring to meet demand resulting in more stimulation and inflation, but would probably increase the participation rate over 63%. Or the federal government attempts to intervene to control inflation, which, depending one which mechanism they employ, could result in the participation rate either increasing or decreasing. One possibility is the increase of federal cash transfers/benefits makes it more advantageous to not enter the workforce in the short term. Additionally, the federal debt to GDP is over 133%. Generally, anything over 80% is not considered financially stable, which historically has led to increased printing of money then inflation and if not controlled hyperinflation. Currently such notable countries as Sudan (212%), Eretria (176%), Suriname (166%), Barbados (143%), Maldives (140%), Cape Verde (138%), and Belize (127%) top the list of countries with the highest debt to GPD rate. Of note, also among the top ten are Japan (257%), Greece (210%), and Italy (157%), all of which have faced limited adverse economic impact, mainly slow growth, in comparation to the other countries on the top ten list. Japan, for almost a decade now, has aggressively pursued an economic policy of high government spending in exchange for controlled, slow economic growth. Italy is pursuing a similar policy. So, what does all of this mean? The federal government better have a plan in place that does not solely relay on economic growth or even an economic boom. I am not not that confident in the ability of the federal government, which leads me to believe that it is more than likely a 63% or higher participation rate will be hit this year, but what comes next could be very messy. Of note, the participate rate has never recovered from the Great Recession, but that is a discussion for another day."

Zooming out on the chart, there is not a single instance of a 1.5% jump in participation rate within a ~7 month period of time. There was a single period of time that was very close, however: 58.1% in Dec 1954 to 59.7% in Aug 1955.
