An average of 15.8M/day would need to be added to reach 12B by May 31, more than double last week's rate, so I see no chance of bin 2 happening. An average of 3.75M/day will need to be added to reach 12B by July 31. If we get to May 31 with ~186M to go to reach 12B, then 3.05M/day would be needed to reach 12B by July 31, which I think is likely.

Even if another 122M were added every 2 weeks, which is likely an overestimate as the rate at which doses are given will likely continue to fall, only 366M more would be added through May 31.

From April 10 to 17, the 7-day average has fallen by 1.31M.

My current understanding is now that when a number >=12B *first* appears on the source website graph, the question will resolve. It will resolve to the earliest date for which a number >=12B appears on the graph - which may or may not be the day before. This means that there will likely not be a large difference between the date on which a number >=12B first appears on the website graph and the date for which the graph shows >=12B was first reached. It could potentially be somewhat large (a few days? a week?) if some country made a gigantic data backreporting drop, but given typical data movements, it is not likely to be more than 1 or 2 days. It appears that data will likely be evaluated for this question before nearly all back reporting has occurred. This is consistent with the fact that no statement was made in the original question saying that data for a given date would be accessed on some specific, later date (e.g., 14 days later, or whatever). I have asked for one more clarification to be sure."

The world vaccination rate is generally declining. If it declined linearly, then we'd need to reach ~12.36M/day before ~35 days from now to end up below 12M by May 31. But the world vaccination rate will likely decline a bit more slowly than linearly, so we'd need to reach ~12.36M/day at least a few days before that. On Feb 22, the 7-day average of doses/day was 22.53M; this could be considered above a trend that would have been approx 19M/day then. On March 22, it was 15.74M. If one uses the more conservative drop of 3.25M/day over 4 weeks and project this linearly forward, then in 28 days, we should be at a trend level of ~12.5M doses/day.

The Philippines recently reported an uptick in vaccinations, but otherwise, the trend is still downwards. China has increased vaccination administration very modestly. 75 days between March 17 and May 31. The average daily administration rate will have to stay above 12.67M/day for the question to resolve in bin 2. The Philippines and China are the largest question marks in my mind, but if their vaccination rates stay relatively flat, then I think bin 3 is likely. (The Philippines has fully vaccinated 64.7M and is targeting 90M ""by June""; they will add at most ~51M doses.) 4 weeks ago, on Feb 17, the 7-day average of doses/day was 25.52M; on March 17, it was 17.18M/day, a drop of 8.34M/day. 17.18M/day (now) - 12.67M (average needed to stay in bin 2) = 4.51M/day.

While Delta is still spreading, it is good to get vaccinated with the current vaccine, but many who are vaccine hesitant in the first place probably won't. And Omicron vaccines supposedly won't start to be available until mid-March, and probably won't be widely available until somewhere around June. I'm not sure what the net here is, but I suspect that if Omicron replaces Delta, there will be a surge in Omicron vaccine uptake as it becomes available. So, if Omicron spreads, then perhaps we'll see a slight slowing in the rate of vaccine uptake through March, followed by an upsurge. Production capabilities are increasing, and demand will be high.

If it stayed at 1 billion per month, we would hit it in April. However the graph more or less resembles a logistic curve that is starting to level off. This makes sense given that in developed countries anyone who wants vaccination has been able to get it for a while. If globally 1/3 of people either refuse vaccination, are children, or are otherwise unreachable, then 2 dose vaccination has an upper limit of maybe 5 billion people and 10 billion doses. In that case it will take boosters to carry us to 12bn."
