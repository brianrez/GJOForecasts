20646,2022-03-16T18:33:03Z,1,[85.0],[85.0],30 year mortgage rates are generally accepted to roughly follow the US 10 year bond yield. With historic 30-year mortgage typically having a spread slightly below 2% above the 10-year yields. (I will note there has been a recent slight deviation from this trend with the spread increasing recently to ~3%).
99943,2022-03-16T17:30:52Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],"The last time the rate was above 4.15% was in April, 2019. But, the rate has been rising a bit recently, and the most current data point is 3.85% on March 10. There are 7 more data points in the forecast period, and 0.3% higher to go to reach 4.15%. Monthly movements have been up to +0.23% recently. With inflation and the Fed expected to raise interest rates even a little, I think rates above 4.15% are likely in the forecast period."
14603,2022-03-16T17:15:20Z,2,[0.0],[-50.0],I found the wording for this confusing - I answered it in the noise challenge as 0% on the basis the average has to be 4.15 and so the rate needs to rise well above this quite soon.
104609,2022-03-16T17:07:20Z,1,[27.0],[27.0],"4.15% seems out of reach as a 4/29 target. Usually, moves as drastic as this dont happen very often. Market reaction to tighter monetary policy should push it up nonetheless. The details of the Fed announcement and especially clarity over the pace of rate hikes will be essential for this outcome. However, the nature of the considered instrument, makes this event relatively unlikely."
103527,2022-03-16T16:31:56Z,1,[39.0],[39.0],"Last time we saw 4.15% was May 2019, so well before COVID. Given the recent move in yields higher -- likely on the back of the expectation of significant FED tightening -- I'm not as confident that we'll see sustained moves higher from here, at least in the short-term. So I give this a 39% chance."
