No question, that this will end above 200K, and no question that many experts are talking about billions of infected people in the next year/s with millions dying and shutdowns happening everywhere. But I see one thing, that gives me hope (of course also hoping, that the reason isn´t just the lack of testing kits and also fearing bad briers on all the other questions related to corona, I´m in): daily growth rates are not increasing further in the regions I analysed (with my homecountry germany the only bigger exception in Europe (where this is currently growing fastest)). China, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore have all been relatively stable for a while now. Growth in most countries in Europe isn´t as bad as it was in the last days. Although we have got 162 of about 200 countries in the world on the list now, it looks like even the numbers of the worst growing countries on worldometers could stop growing at 20%+ per day with growth even declining in many places. There are some worries, just looking at todays numbers: Malaysia, Pakistan, parts of South Amerika have huge growth rates today, and there as well as in Africa the medical situation might not be perfect. But the overall picture looks better today. I wish, it was true and @ddorsey , as we were on the same pessimistic track for a while so far, would see it the same way (being right with optimistic views feels better than with pessimistic ones !). In spite of the expert´s theories about 50-80% worldwide infection rates - now I really hope, that the chimp will win this. The worldometers data at least is getting better for it ;-) I´d prefer positive responses to my little optimism (after having felt quite beat down from the UK governments analysis (my father is 76, and it really sounded like ""all above 70 are in greatest danger"" to me) yesterday) from you as well: @Prognosticating-Beek @Dillyweed @ManuPV @Greyowlsova @dlaiocean @Anneinak"

Per the Johns Hopkins site, there are presently ~163k cases, which means that adding 36k gets us to 199k before this question ends. My estimate of 70% in the +200k category is based on a continuation of the current exponential (vice lineal) trend.

Worldometers numbers (6 days left compared to the 7 with WHO) right now: - growth rate and perspective China, Diamond Princess, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan unchanged. Together safe 90K+ in the end. Looked like that for days now and will stay so. - Italy and Iran with todays growth rates: >80K together in the end (>30K tomorrow). - ""Rest of the world"" (and for me that´s not what most people here think ""anything but china"", it´s more differentiated) again growing at high speed.

I have been wondering what the total numbers might actually be. My concern is that our data so far is based on individuals with fairly clear cases requiring supportive treatment, ICUs, etc. What I don’t know is how widespread are the mild cases? In the spirit of Tetlock’s ‘Superforecasting’ I came up with the following subjective estimate of the multiples and probabilities [Multiplying Factor {Prob}] that the public data could be off at this point in time: [1x (20%), 2x (40%), 3x (20%), 4x (10%), 5x (5%), >5x (5%)].

However, by March 20, the global cases will very likely exceed 100,000. I have adjusted upward, and anticipate the highest likelihood between 100,000-200,000 cases by March 20. To explain as I did in my first forecast: I am using the Logistic Distribution function to model S-Curve (cumulative) cases. This is the system dynamic of disease propagation as explained by many including Dr. John Sterman of MIT (see Business Dynamics, and the original work in System Dynamics by MIT Prof. Jay Forrester). The function is fitted to a line using the GRG algorithm in Excel Solver. However, this method is not without difficulty as an optimum point is not provided by the Logistics Distribution function. Regardless, multiple iterations of solutions can provide a reasonable estimate."

This phenomenon is global. However, due to the widespread advice to self isolate, and the often mild presenting symptoms which may be confused with other conditions, plus that when people are housebound, ill, self-isolating and following guidelines, as they will not be tested they won't be part of these totals, plus the present definition by the WHO of being proven instances of moderate to severe cases. In nations without free healthcare, these 'mild' presentations and the prohibited cost vs limited benefit of treatment in non-severe cases also means less reporting. China, a hugely populous country has already had its officially reported ""peak"" and that Present total is c.93,000 cases, while other regions with huge populations, high inequality, without free access to healthcare (India, African, South America, Pakistan, South East Asia) will likely not add significant numbers to the above. I therefore would estimate that while the present growth rate will continue to gradually rise (current typical case diagnosis rise from last month, apart from the day china changed case metrics, has rarely strayed beyond 1%(+-0.5%)), this may increase slightly, but likely not enough to push it over 200k). I predict that the REPORTED new cases rate may rise to 1.75% (+/-0.5). Therefore giving my most likely prediction range as being between 115k- 135k total."

The number of new confirmed cases is increasing on a daily basis, and is currently around 1.5 - 2k new cases per day. It is likely that this will further increase but will reach a plateau as more measures are taken to delay the transmission or contain it. The upper limit of 200k is for the time being the most likely within the timeframe. But, as the number of transmission clusters increases, a dramatic acceleration could happen. This is especially relevant if contain goes unchecked in Africa. However, the question is about the number of confirmed cases. This requires a proper diagnostic and is therefore dependent on available testing kits and resources (including staff) to carry out the test. So while the number of total cases will certainly exceed the 200k, the number of confirmed cases is likely to stay under that figure."

Countries are more aware, alarmed, and hopefully prepared, with WHO issuing warnings and many countries in quarantine, etc. Therefore, to have unopposed spread to hit 200,000 is probably not as likely.

In an initial forecast 2 weeks ago, I assessed a 29% chance the number of Wuhan Coronavirus reported cases would reach between 25,000 to 100,000 by March 20, 2020. At the time, the virus's growth rate, based on WHO daily situation reports, reflected an average of 979 new reported cases a day. Since the initial forecast, the daily global growth rate has increased to 1,802 reported cases a day, even though new reports in China have decreased. Deaths outside of China, and Asia, have also increased despite stronger prevention and containment efforts by national public health officials. The number of reported cases on February 11, 2020, reached 43,103, with the projected total of cases reaching 80,289 by March 20, 2020. As the growth rate rises, and without successful intervention, I now foresee the number of reported cases growing to 126,183 by that same time. As test kit supplies run low in China, the accuracy of reporting in the region is unreliable, making it likely many more cases are not yet detected. WHO representation states the world is not ready for a global outbreak and encourages nations to sustain measures for quick action on isolation and social distancing. The revised forecast suggests a 75% chance the number of reported cases will remain between 100,000 and 200,000 by March 20, 2020, with a 25% chance it will grow higher if measures are sustained."

There is still a significant possibility of secondary outbreaks. For example, Korea just doubled its number of confirmed cases to 104 today. Many of the new cases came because of a single person who went to church and then a hospital and the disease spread to over 50 people (confirmed so far). So there is definitely still a relatively high risk it could spread farther over the next month but I think that it is more likely to level off shy of the 100,000 cases.

The reduction in cases per day has been dramatic. This is not consistent with the Logistics model. The progression is not characteristically smooth. This pattern existed immediately before the Chinese NHC revised its cases to include non-RNA test observations. Again, given the scale of the outbreak, the data suggests that the NHC is not able to collect all of the case information and report accurately. As such, further adjustments seem likely. However, given that the current data suggests the third tipping point of the Logistics model has been achieved, it is more likely that <100,000 case is possible. My model presently forecasts ~80,000 cases total, but again I anticipate under-reporting. I have adjusted downward, but anticipate the highest likelihood between 100,000-200,000 cases by March 20. To explain as I did in my first forecast: I am using the Logistic Distribution function to model S-Curve (cumulative) cases. This is the system dynamic of disease propagation as explained by many including Dr. John Sterman of MIT (see Business Dynamics, and the original work in System Dynamics by MIT Prof. Jay Forrester). The function is fitted to a line using the GRG algorithm in Excel Solver. However, this method is not without difficulty as an optimum point is not provided by the Logistics Distribution function. Regardless, multiple iterations of solutions can provide a reasonable estimate."

After the update for today, WHO will have the second number close to 71K as well – bureaucratic channels are always slower. The difference between numbers is that China now includes clinically diagnosed cases - lesions in both lungs by CT plus other symptoms – in their count while WHO at this point recognizes only laboratory confirmed cases - confirmed by DNA testing (e.g. PCR), but for the big picture reports clinically diagnosed cases as well. I should stress that BOTH sets of numbers are INCORRECT as they both differ from the real numbers of infections: laboratory confirmed cases do not include clinical cases that were not confirmed by PCR because of the lack of kits, samples, logistics, personnel… And clinically diagnosed cases may include cases NOT caused by COVID-19 - pneumonias with other etiology. And both numbers will not include mild cases when people did not get to the hospital and recovered at home or otherwise ignored, deliberately or not. So BOTH reported numbers are just approximations: most probably, the higher number is closer to the truth."

Other reasons for my projected outcome include the possibility for upticks in infections from superspreaders-- such as the case with the one infected man from Hong Kong who was aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship and has so far infected 355 passengers (NPR)-- and also the continued transmission of the disease between quarantined families in Wuhan.

The number has reached more than 25,000, which makes the first probabilities not valid. So far the overall death toll is less than SARS, but it is much easier for coronavirus to be spread from person to person. Currently, China has the highest risk of this virus with majority of the infected population. Outside of China, the number of infected are 307 of confirmed cases. The spread of the coronavirus is not that rapid, with countries and airlines stopping travels to and from China. Most of the virus is contained in China, that is why I do not believe that the number of cases will not be more that 200,000. But, since it is easier to catch the virus and it takes two weeks to find out if someone is infected, this causes the virus to spread easily. There have been reported cases of a cruise ship in Japan that is currently quarantined and twenty Germans from Wuhan have just been flown back home. Since these cases are happening internationally, this foreshadows to possibly more people getting infected, but since there are more careful procedures, it can be contained. I believe that by March 2020 the cases of coronavirus will be less than 100,000 people. https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200209-sitrep-20-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=6f80d1b9_4 https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/01/22/mapping-spread-new-coronavirus/?arc404=true https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-we-know-about-the-wuhan-virus-11579716128 https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-02-09-20-intl-hnk/index.html"

The 1 model I’ve seen put the numbers way past 200,000 by March. Also where as the infected already outside China have bee easy to track down or self quarantine by a simple rule of “did they come from Wuhan and do they have respiratory symptoms,” doing that will quickly become unmanageable for countries outside China once the virus spreads more throughout China. I am not sure if the numbers outside China will end up playing much of a role to the final count though. I am leaving it as low as 70% since I’ve only looked at one model that someone else did, and I didn’t bother learning how to calculate the model myself. I should also add that I am guessing that the models predict actual spread and not how many cases will actually be able to be confirmed, so that is another reason to keep the number as low as 70% since there is an additional calculation of how likely is it that the number of confirmed case will represent a good portion of the number of actual cases."

I am assuming the rate of increase in the number of cases, which is currently around 40% a day, will drop, This is because (presumably) many infected people had assumed they what was ailing them was flu if they were not seriously ill, but now infected people have been added to the 2018-nCoV diagnosis. If the increase in diagnosed cases drops to 25% (which could be a reasonable guess) after 10 days the number of diagnosed people would increase 10 fold. So 3K becomes 30k by around 7th feb, 300k by 17th Feb. As it takes up to 14 days for the symptoms to show, my guess is that there are already 30,000 infected people who don't yet know they are infected. Hopefully the infection rate will slow, but it is likely that there are now infected people with no symptoms spread all over the world in cities that don't yet know they have any infection and these infected people are spreading the virus world wide."
