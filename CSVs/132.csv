Cook gives this district a slight partisan lean in favor of Republicans at R+2. This election is rematch. Wild (D) defeated Scheller (R) in 2020 with 51.7% of the vote, which was less than expected. Overall, neither party demonstrates a distinct advantage in rematches in the US House. Democrats won by a slight margin in 2018, Republicans won by a slight margin in 2020. Money has poured into both campaign here, making this the most expensive midterm election in PA. The broad narrative earlier this year was that despite all odds, Democrats would avoid the midterm losses typically sustained by the President's party. In the last act, the story seems to have changed. Given Wild's under-performance in their first contest, an R+2 district, and the midterm curse, I give Scheller a very slight edge here, 52-48."
