As it stands now, Kasich still has fewer delegates than Marco Rubio and even came in 4th place behind Rubio in the Arizona primary a week after Rubio suspended his campaign. Kasich has not won any delegates since this became a three-person race. Kasich has continued to underperform in recent primaries. Kasich has little money and organization and has no national campaign apparatus. There is no reason to believe that Kasich's decision to remain in the race or to suspend his campaign is in any way tied to his performance in any primary contest. He has no mathematical path to the nomination, he can only hope for a brokered/contested convention."

Trust me, this cover story has Kasich's attention and that of his advisors. Discusses likelihood of his winning on second or third ballot in Cleveland. Mentions polls showing Kasich as the only Republican candidate who beats Clinton in a head to head matchup, and a Politco website poll of insiders assembled by the site who see Kasich as the most palatable candidate in the event of a contested convention, which today seems even more likely in light of a new poll showing Trump falling 10 points behind Cruz in Wisconsin. Given the increasingly fervent discussion about Kasich's path, he seems unlikely to pull out even if he runs completely out of money. I'm increasing the ""in it for the long haul"" odds to 91%, with surprisingly big delegate wins by Trump as the chief risk to my forecast."

As of 3/29/16, many top operatives and Kasich himself believe that he has the best chance of Republicans in the general election. In order for Trump to win on the first ballot, he would need in excess of 55% of the remaining delegates, which is highly improbable given his rising unfavorable ratings in polls since the primaries began and his recent attacks on Cruz' wife. If Trump does not win on the first ballot, the delegates are free to switch to another candidate. Top party operatives seem crystal-clear on this scenario as does Kasich. The only reason I'm not 90% is that Kasich says he won't drop out ""before Wisconsin"". I'm concerned that he's not stating more confidence about hanging in there than that statement implies. His motivation for staying in is exceedingly high. Dropping out before the convention would be a baffling move that would throw the party into a state of near despair. It's certainly not impossible, and money may determine the outcome, but it would go down as one of the great fumbles in American political history."

However, it seems more likely that in this case Kasich would make certain strategic moves (as Rubio did in Ohio) to push his delegates to Cruz without dropping off the ballot entirely.

That said, there is no recent polling of WI - the last poll (2/18-2/21) included Carson, Rubio and Bush (http://fox6now.com/2016/02/25/new-marquette-university-law-school-poll/). Let's assume the race is a toss-up between Trump and Kasich in WI. Losing all 3 primaries before NY will likely entail the end of the Kasich campaign (though there is always a chance he somehow convinces himself to stay in). I therefore estimate his chances of dropping out before NY as 40%."
