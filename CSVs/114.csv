Twitter valuation is much higher that what it should be. It’s virtually impossible to communicate with government employees or agencies on Twitter rendering it a useless platform for communicating with government. Generally communication with so called “followers” is sparse and useless as well. If you are not extremely popular, Twitter is a waste of time if your looking for a response. Analytical information is highly useful and shows to what extreme people avoid responding to tweets. Say for instance you tweet about UFOs to high level government agencies, you can see that there were lots of reviews but zero responses. That of course tells a person who created the tweet many things and most of them aren’t good.

106948,2022-07-21T07:57:04Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"21/07/2022 - Value creation plan of a twitter acquisition is weak. Purchase of twitter by Elon Musk appears to rely heavily on a personal desire, with minimal financial reasoning. As inflation rises in Q2/3 2022, and Tesla share price reduction, I expect Elon Musk's appetite to spend ~$40bn on a personal project with limited profitability or justification very slim. Elon is currently focussing conversation around fake accounts on twitter, it is unconfirmed whether this is a real issue or not. At present, Twitter/Musk are going to trail in October over a dispute to hurry the process along - not good for the overall health of the acquisition process."

It's uncertain if Musk actually wants the deal to go through though and it all might just be a publicity stunt. Additionally the SEC is looking into his purchase of shares.
