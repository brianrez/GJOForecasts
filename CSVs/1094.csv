McDonald's seems to be able to increase profit margins through sales and by streamlining operations and logistics. Sourcing alternative proteins would require investing in new suppliers and operational chains, perhaps even training. With the global market outlook not looking very promising currently, McDonald's might probably resolve to play it safe and invest in opening new stores in 'underexplored' markets around the world.

From my own analysis I do not see vegetarian options making a big splash in the fast food arena at least in US. From my own experience, US vegetarians on average have a negative outlook towards fast food. The higher costs that come with the vegetarian option reduces the chance of adoption because the margins are already slim in the industry. McDonald's is still the leader in the fast food industry and can afford to sit back and watch. If they see the market booming they can ride wave and if they see the market tumbling they will hold off.

It needs the agreements in place and the legal aspect handled. Which, admittedly can occur rather quickly. But they will likely wait for data from Del Taco and Burger King, to see if the average customer of these brands respond to these offerings. Plus, with the most stores nationwide, and a conglomerate of franchise owners, these wheels don't turn quickly. I'd like to be wrong.

Nor are franchisees looking forward to the expense of redesign and re-training. So they will want to careful - and might even elect not be on the bleeding edge of change - but to let BK and others lead the way, and to learn/profit from the experience. Nevertheless, ""meatless"" has been coming into the public consciousness for more than a decade - so they will react. McD testing in in Germany (not sure why there over other places). They already have maybe a decade's experience selling non-beef in India. McDonalds is baseline interested in selling food - and would not seem to be wedded to meat - as it's experience in India shows. People, especially more established customers, don't want to be trendy - they just want ""a burger"" - and want to choose whether it has meat, or is meatless, with as little thought as it takes to choose whether to have cheese on it. Finally -there remains a fair amount of study in kitchen redesign and cooking techniques and supply chain to get meatless meat right. India's experience should prove helpful - but probably also cautionary. These things have dollar costs and inefficiency costs that running a restaurant cannot take lightly. They do not want to drive away more customers than have already been lost to cultural changes and changing tastes. I also sense the franchisees and C-Suite are not themselves ready - judging by public statements. To me it has to be branded as meatless meat - continuing to label it as a ""veggie burger' or ""vegan burger' is a culturally obtuse understanding of the matter, and will impede support by franchisees and interest by customers. When I start seeing ""meatless meat"" branding in CEO Easterbrook public statements, then I'll feel the organization has ""signed on"", and rollout is imminent."

Times may be changing but vegetarians do not select a fast food restaurant as their go to option. In an jrban environment McD veg patty would compete a multitude of vegetarian dining choices. So I believe McD does not rollout a test phase in the US.
