I will be truly objective: Turkey lived an enormous unity after July 15, 2016 Failed Coup Attempt. However the politicians begin to split against the wishes of Turkish People, they couldn't keep this soul inside their policy. Turkey has lots of threats both at home and abroad. The exterior enemies are not countries but the global terrorist organizations, e. g. ISIS is a huge threat also for Turkey. PKK's been its enemies for over 30 years. FETO, led by cleric Fethullah Gulen (former-ally-then-enemy for the ruling party AKP), is also a matter of Turkish national security. But Turkey has become closer again with its former allies, Russia and Israel. If friendly and well-intended cooperation between those countries become much more strong, Turkey will continue to protect its current stable atmosphere. Yet I see an comparetively high per cent of chance for a bad incident until Christmas."

After males are recalled up, the Turkish parliament can declare that the state is in a critical condition which makes women from ages 18 to 42 are obligated to serve. As many of us here remember - compulsory service is a great homogenizer of ethnic groups. Should the ax fall only on one or two groups it will ripple into the population of the soldiers families and create a caste system beyond rank in the services - and it looks like the Air Force could be the service to watch closest as Ozturk (the General bearing the brunt of Erdogans accusations) so this service has a greater representation in the upper class in Turkey as evidenced by their boldness, they felt it necessary to support the constitution that Erdogan is destroying, to stand up a coup attempt.

This necessitates changes to the constitution, which in turn requires a 3/5th majority in parliament. When elections in June 2015 did not bring this majority, especially because the Kurdish HDP party entered parliament, Erdogan ended the peace process with the Kurdish PKK. Martial law and a media blackout in Kurdish areas followed, but reports of systematic destruction of HDP strongholds including the killing of hundreds of civilians still came to light. The repeat elections of November 2015 did not result in a 3/5th majority for Edogan, again, but the whole process demonstrates his willingness to sacrifice peace and hundreds of lives for his political aims and increased internal tensions and the societal polarization. With Erdogans counter-coup and his Gleichschaltung of the judiciary, executive, media and education sector coupled with the removal of parliamentary immunity of more than a fourth of all parliamentarians, including 80% of the HDP representatives, Erdogan has everything in place to allow him to establish a totalitarian regime. Totalitarian regimes are historically prone to commit mass killings. Edogans past use of force for political ends and his apparent lack of respect for human lives (for example illustrated by the debate about reintroducing the death penalty), combined his adventurism in foreign relations paint a picture of his character that makes it likely he could resort the use of deadly force against civilians on a grander scale. As Turkey internal division between Kemalists and Islamists border on the edge of a civil war and a peaceful resolution is remote, the combined effects of Government purges and repression against opposition, the conflict with the PKK, terrorism from ISIS and civil strife between Kemalists and Islamists will most probably result in more than 1000 civilians being killed by armed forces, police or militias during this year."

The largest death toll was 100 (one attack, Ankara, Oct. 2015), and the rest caused considerably smaller numbers of dead. There are a number of perpetrator groups: Islamic State, Kurdish groups and sub-groups, even a Marxist group. The Kurds state their general opposition to targeting civilians. The EWP defines ""mass killing"" as killing at least 1,000 civilians. So far the attacks have resulted in far too small numbers to suggest a significant number of future true mass attacks, but with so many perpetrator groups, there is some possibility of at least one real mass attack at some future time."
