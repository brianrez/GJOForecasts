We can't compare with 2019 for those days because the days shown in the table correspond to Memorial Day weekend in 2019. So at this point, it all depends on how likely one thinks it is that travel numbers will go up enough. I don't think travel supply is yet saturated, and it would just take a slight bump up compared to yesterday to reach 2.4M. And I expect travel demand to generally increase through the rest of the month. If it increases even slightly, 2.4M will be reached this coming weekend. Also, on the theory that what goes up must come down, if we saw nearly 2.4M yesterday, I think we can expect to see some similarly high numbers this weekend. So, I'm raising my forecast."

This is the highest Thursday number we have seen in the forecast period, excluding Easter weekend. This is the lowest Thursday percentage to date; the previous range was 88.4% to 99.1%, excluding Easter weekend. Except around Easter, Fridays have averaged 2.5% greater than the day before, range 0.6%-4.6%. The most recent Friday was 2.0% higher than the day before. So I'll expect Friday's number to be between 2.342M and 2.435, probably closer to the expected average 2.5% higher number, 2.386M or just below. So I give Friday a ~48% chance of exceeding 2.4M, if we say that this week's numbers are likely to end up averaging ~89.5% of 2019 numbers, or a ~36% chance based on the typical pattern of Fridays vs. Thursdays. I give Sunday a ~50% chance of exceeding 2.4M, if we say that this week's numbers are likely to end up averaging ~89.5% of 2019 numbers, or looking at the ratios of Sundays to the Thursdays before, I get a ~40% chance that this coming Sunday will see 2.4M or more. If we average it all out to ~40% chance that today or Sunday will individually see 2.4M or more, and project the same odds for next weekend, this would give an 88% chance of seeing 2.4M either this weekend or next weekend. So I'll lower my forecast slightly to 85%. It's possible that next weekend will see more traffic than this one, too."

We should see the semester end peak on May 22, but 1.1% above this year's spring break peak would be 2.393, just barely below threshold. I don't think these numbers can fluctuate super dramatically considering they're based off of scheduled airline flights with set capacity. Would be below 50%, but bumping higher because I think its more likely for students to forego spring break travel during COVID than travel to home or to an internship, especially if they live in a dorm and need to move, so the bump will likely be proportionally larger than 2019 pre-COVID."
