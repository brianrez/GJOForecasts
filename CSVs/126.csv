I had missed the (now-fixed) typo and then when I realized it this morning, I thought long and hard about the resolution and recalculated and recalculated the price comparisons, to find Cardano had already met the criteria. So I made a drastic update to Cardano but leaving room for the chance it had been a typo. Lo and behold, it was, so I reverted back to XRP (Ripple).
