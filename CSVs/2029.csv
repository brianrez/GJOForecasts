Given the current poor bilateral US-Russia relationship, it won't be logical that Putin will attend the last one, because that will mean escalation of interest in the summit by Russia. 3. I am not giving a 0 because 'redacted' makes a good point about some unexpected, unrelated issue that would make Putin come and talk to Obama face-to-face (e.g. Syria, or some plane crash). Another reason is Putin sometimes behaves unexpectedly, e.g. recent decision to partially pull military out of Syria."

For that reason, I gave a higher probability than the crowd’s average of 3%. I now want to follow Champs Know and update my opinion based on the passage of time and a changing assessment of prior information. Since time has passed and the Nuclear Summit is drawing nearer and Putin still does not plan on attending, it is less likely that he will attend. I also decided to “hunt for the right information” and search for information that contradicts my beliefs. In order to avoid confirmation basis I searched for evidence saying that Putin will attend the summit and found no reliable sources speaking out with this opinion."

Although this message was relayed quite some time ago, Putin did not see the “value” in the summit and believed that those countries who held views that differed from the organizers would be “ignored.” The Russian Foreign Ministry said it regarded the leaks about their decision at the time by the American media to be an “unsuccessful attempt to put pressure on the Russian side in order to change our position… we consider such efforts counterproductive.” Russian spokespeople have expressed their preference for the International Atomic Energy Agency for assessing global nuclear security over the Nuclear Security Summits. Mr. Putin is not one to change his mind either, further pointing to a forecast of “no.”"

Also Putin does not want a situation in which he is outcast like he was at the G20 summit in 2014. The visual of Putin by himself does not fit the narrative the Russian government wants to represent. The narrative they support is that the West is against Russia, but cannot deal with international issues without Russia.

According to Zakharova, Moscow believes “the creation of such a precedent of outside meddling in the work plan of international organizations that have great expert potential and embedded in democratic procedures to be unacceptable. In November 2014, the Russian Foreign Ministry confirmed that Russia would not be attending the event, saying it would rather focus on the IAEA High Level Conference on Nuclear Security to be held this year. “This is why Russian President Vladimir Putin, as you know, has decided to drop our participation in the preparations for the 2016 summit,” Zakharova said. “We understand that the IAEA with all of its necessary expert potential should play the central role in coordinating community efforts in nuclear security,” she added."""

Like the business executive who seeks to co-ordinate business trips with personal activities (Florida in the winter) so as to accrue the intangible benefit (of sunshine) under a business expense reimbursement scheme, is it possible that Putin has demonstrated any historical proclivity to ""kill two birds with one stone"" by making trips which, on the surface appear to be for reason X, but behind-the-scenes may equally be for reason Y? I ask this because the S-300 delivery was apparently consummated under the auspices of Putin attending a regional gas conference. Might it be possible that Putin might wish to visit the United States at this time for some reason independent of the Nuclear Security Summit, and the Summit might be a useful cover for such a visit? Kerry will supposedly be in Moscow this week. There are, one would expect, continuous discussions between Washington and Moscow on a variety of subjects at a variety of levels. Perhaps there is some subject that percolates to the top, so to speak, where a face-to-face meeting between Putin and Obama would be important. Certainly such a meeting could occur independently of the Summit, but then the subject of the meeting becomes a special topic of (perhaps undesired) focus. To my mind Russia has more-or-less divorced themselves from the U.S.-led Summit approach to nuclear security, and seems to be in favor of establishing the IAEA as the premier international body for this function. Why would they desire to support the ""Summit alternative"" to the IAEA? Yet, such a meeting would provide a very plausible reason for Putin to come to the United States without an alternative reason becoming the focus of public attention. Are there any alternative reasons that might spring to mind?"

I recall that around this time (late 2014) Russia said it was bolstering its nuclear tipped cruise missile force in kalingrad; an entirely useless threat but good for dramatic effect.

Putin may want to have a seat at the table now that he's become somewhat respectable again, on the other hand, he may feel confident in blowing it off for the same reason, and to show that Washington is no longer the ringmaster.
