China cancels the issue of joint commemorative stamps with India without explanation. See https://reut.rs/36WG6zN. This is unlikely to lead to war albeit wars have started in history for similarly apparently unimportant issues. Will it lead to ""a lethal confrontation at sea between the forces of...""? That begs the question; which forces? Navy? Air? Coast Guard? Any of these? With increasing forays of Chinese fishing vessels into waters India deems its EEZ it is inevitable that Chinese Coast Guard (with or without their new powers to carry munitions) will also be found in Indian waters. While I doubt China would stage manage an accident in Indian fishing territories, accidents are an increasing possibility that could include a fatality.

Moreover, there naval forces and other conventional forces have built up recently, each country know that a conflict between them, two major nuclear powers, would be too risky, it could escalate quickly. A sea confrontation would be perceived as an escalation even more serious than the ""skirmishes"" on the border which can be attributed to soldiers losing temper, or similar reasons (though not 100% well-funded). There will be less open doors to avoid conflict if there's a lethal confrontation between military forces at sea. Thus, I assess only an accidental lethal confrontation could occur. I did not find reasonable figures giving probabilities of accident in the territorial waters and in the regions neighboring China and India (where it is the more likely to occur, I neglect other regions). On the top of it, we must assess the probability of escalation to be lethal (unless the accident is serious enough to make casualties). Hence, the probability is low, but not null since it is known that the China sea is very crowded and dangerous on itself. For sure, collisions occur more often than people would like. This very situation would not improve before March 2021 (later prospects of enhancement of navigation precision may not have effect by then)."

The fact that the question presents the possibility of these ""forces"" being militia and law enforcement raises the probability that a lethal confrontation could occur, both because it is a larger class of actors than exclusively military forces but also because China has used their LE forces heavily in the the South China Seas. Here's a great visual reference on the use of LE in maritime disputes in the SCS since 2010 (note that this does not show disputes relative to military forces) to demonstrate when, how, where and resolution of these disputes: https://csis-ilab.github.io/cpower-viz/csis-china-sea/ Note that India is not listed in any of the maritime disputes in the SCS, which tend to revolve around territorial/sea claims. Nevertheless, China shows it routinely uses ramming, harassment, arrest, official protest, shooting, water cannon, and has detained foreign individuals for alleged activities that violate Chinese sovereignty--all activities that could quickly escalate in a situation where China perceived India was in unauthorized sea territory. I am not confident that losing an individual or two during a detainment or arrest would make it into the press, either."

The issues raised by the June 2020 incident. One wouldn't expect this particular incident to spill over into a sea-based one due to the location, but certainly both militaries are going to be affected by it. 3. The tendency for maritime meetings to be non-lethal. Iran and North and South Korea aside, maritime military incidents rarely escalate into loss of life, even when collisions unintentionally (or intentionally) happen. They may act in a provocative manner, but sailors from large powers tend to act in a more-or-less professional manner. Even when potentially deliberate collisions happen they are non lethal. Exceptions are true violations of navigations rules, but those are safety lapses and not due to confrontations. https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/29249/what-we-know-about-a-mysterious-collision-between-a-chinese-warship-and-a-taiwanese-cargo-ship This includes airspace.

The Chinese increase aggressiveness over freedom of passage in the South Pacific certainly has India increasing its defensive stance in the Indian Ocean and near the Straights. India is changing their typical stance and inviting foreign allies like the U.S., Japan and Australia to its outer ports as a clear sign of coalition strength, but this will likely further decrease lethal engagement between India and China."

Winter reduces that risk even though clashes have occurred then in the past. It is hard to see either of them commencing a shooting war at sea. To do so could mean sparking all-out war and it's equally hard to see how that could be in either nation's interest. They have always treated the Ladakh LOC as a regional Himalayan dispute not as a causus belli and the same applies to the South China Sea (even more so considering India has no border there). There is a minimal chance of death but only by collision or some other accident.

95707,2020-09-28T12:56:14Z,1,[9.0],[9.0],"The key element of the question is whether a confrontation results in death. This is extraordinarily rare among all the historical sea-borne confrontations China has had with all countries. This is compounded by the relatively early efforts underway by both China and India to assert control over sea lanes south of China, well outside the more contentious SCS region. While the relative newness of the IN-CHN seaborne conflict does assume greater risk, the sheer size of the area under review, multiples larger than the SCS region, suggests plenty of room to maneuver without conflict arising. I would change my assessment if utilization of India's recently acquired P-8 surveillance aircraft if was used in the SCS region vice current employment in the Indian Ocean or Indian territorial waters."

I have found no evidence of any previous lethal conflict between India and China at sea. And even deaths on land (in the area under actual dispute) have been very sporadic in the last half century. Both China and India have domestic political reasons for the deployment of ships to the Straits and increased rhetoric, but they also have reasons to prevent open conflict with one another. And recent diplomatic talks (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-54113621) seem to have lessened tensions to some degree.

Although Chinese navy has increased its presence in the Indian Ocean, China’s navy primarily operates in its littoral waters and the South China Sea. India on the other hand, has a relatively small navy, and does typically not venture east of the Strait of Malacca. The status quo will likely remain unchanged until 1 March 2021. Recently, in light of the skirmishes along their land border, representatives of both India and China have met along with their Russian counterparts, to diffuse tensions and prevent the military escalation. That should further decrease the likelihood of a lethal confrontation at sea."
95800,2020-09-27T20:56:43Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"Between 2010 and 2016 there were 45 reported incidents and 32 involved China. On the one hand, China has become increasingly aggressive including the sinking of a Vietnamese fishing boat in April 2020 and continuing to increase the area of the SCS that it claims. However, it has been using its Coast Guard and kept the confrontations from becoming lethal. India now joining the SCS fray adds a whole new wrinkle since India and China have a history of confrontations including recent fights along their northern border. This may increase the likelihood of India and China continuing their squabble at sea. For now, it seems like India and China have cooled off."

Also: Looking at the map, it's hard for me to see a reason why the clash between China and India (which are totally concentrated in the inland border between the two countries, near Pakistan) would move to a maritime environment. China does not have a coastline on the Indian Ocean, and I've never heard that China has an interest in moving into the Indian Ocean. Nor have I heard that India is interested in making any claims in the South China Sea, which China does consider its territory. Is there some possibility that a Chinese and Indian ship could encounter each other in some other waters, like the Atlantic, and ram one another, or start shooting, for whatever reason? I suppose, but seems very unlikely. In terms of Time, the deadline is only 5 months away, so seems to me that tensions would have to really heat up in a short time horizon for the dispute between the two countries to play out in a maritime environment."

Any outbreak of war would surely disrupt trade and defeat the object of securing trade routes. However, the escalation could be linked to China’s aggressive behaviour in the South China sea and the Taiwan straits that concerns India’s allies of Japan, US, Australia and other ASEAN countries. I will propose that Indian, albeit in its backyard, will not or cannot confront China without assistance from primarily the US and that would deter China. So, at the moment, all parties are building up naval facilities in strategic locations to complement the fleets. Therefore, the probability of a lethal confrontation between India and China is minimal at this time, although events elsewhere (Taiwan?) may trigger confrontation."

Around Sept. 12, China returned 5 missing Indian nationals detained when they wandered off.

Inside view: China and India have two large army and decades of disputes over this border. Over these decades there have not been any weapons fired with intent to kill. In fact, China and India agreed to prohibit the use of guns or explosives near their border to prevent the escalation of their two large militaries. It seems neither side is looking for war.
