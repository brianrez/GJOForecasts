Since then, and despite the announcement of an official end to military operations at the end of November, Ethiopia’s Tigray region has continued to be affected by armed clashes and insecurity. ‘OHCHR named the Ethiopian National Defence Forces, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, Eritrean armed forces, and Amhara Regional Forces and affiliated militia as culprits.’ That suggests atrocities by all parties with no end in sight. My suggestion is that there will certainly be a state of emergency; but will this be federally imposed or by the UN (with especial concern over refugees."

The government also denied this year that ethical cleansing is going on that US claims were occurring there. There are talks to reopen schools, hospitals are getting back up to speed, there is a COVID testing effort, and there is repeated use of the word normalcy, normal, and security - which was the cause for the termination of one of the past state of emergencies. There is also a strong military presence at the border where Tigray's people fled out of. The government is urging them to return to their homes. Additionally, most SoE's do not seem to last that long. At best, this current SoE may go all the way until expiration date and will not be renewed. I suspect now is the time to start talking about any sense of renewing it. There seems to be no urgency to renew it. *@raciulo mentioned that one of their SoE's was for COVID and it only lasted 5 months, even though COVID is not a 5-month stint. Confirms my confidence that there is a greater chance of letting the Tigray SoE expire."

Whereas i previously had (by default) assumed a normal distribution, a closer inspections learned me that the duration of the conflicts quite clearly follows a PL, in which half of the conflicts last arround a year or less and about 1/6 last 3 years or longer. The intuition behind power-law forecasting is ""the longer something has taken, the longer it will take still"". I used a quick&dirty implementation of this, looking at what percentage of conflicts lasting > 125 days end up lasting > 189 days (using 4/11/20 and 12/5/21). This led me to a probability of 89% (compared with just 63 for the normal distribution)."

This provides a baseline for his continued control and influence over parliament through at least May or June 2021 (when the next election is currently estimated to be held).

Assuming this to be true, it is likely that the armed forces will quickly overwhelm the rebels in a symmetric conflict due to their superiority in arms power. This will cause many refugees to flee the region. Overall, the region is likely to experience a lot of hardships in the coming months. In order to bring stability to the region after a military victory, the Ethiopian government will likely need additional security measures in place and use them to remove any remaining rebels. This is likely not finished in the next months, so the initial 6 months period will highly likely not be shortened."

I will assume that even though a state of emergency has been declared, Tigray probably would agree that they are not ‘under’ the state of emergency. However, given the wording of the question, the government will renew the state of emergency. Ethiopia has a federal constitution based on ethnic lines with each area having a degree of autonomy to administer their regions. Tigray has a history of being a ruling group and was instrumental of displacing a previous Marxist ruler. The current leader Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has attempted to de-federalise the country to which Tigray disagrees and held an illegal election. Abiy has refused to negotiate with the Tigray leaders until they are in custody and their weapons destroyed. Tigray has an army of 250,000 that has been described as ‘battle hardened’ that is larger than the Ethiopian army of 1652,000 (that is probably not). Tigray is not demanding separation from Ethiopia but rather to maintain its status. This does indicate the potential of a civil war that may be settled by arbitration/negotiation arbitrated by the African Union. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/15/rockets-fired-from-ethiopias-tigray-region-hit-eritrean-capital https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-54826875 https://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=ethiopia https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/05/world/africa/ethiopia-war-tigray.html https://www.npr.org/2020/11/13/934241830/what-to-know-about-ethiopias-tigray-conflict https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-54932333"
96930,2020-11-15T23:59:45Z,1,[65.0],[65.0],"States of emergency are quite rare in Ethiopia as the one in 2016 was the first in 25 years. In that crisis the government ruled to tack on another 4 months of the state of emergency. Under the current prime minister he imposed a state of emergency due to covid that lasted 5 months although I could not find if it was extended or not. The essence of the question is whether the government will lengthen the state of emergency after it runs out on May 4th 2021. Judging by recent history and the insistence of the Tigray group (who are firing rockets at nearby Eritrea) I assume that the fighting will be ongoing by May. However the question is whether the country will still be under a state of emergency. I think they will be, but I could also see a situation where the fighting continues but Ahmed does not want the official label of state of emergency especially with elections sometime in 2021. Ahmed has already won a nobel peace prize and will I imagine be eager to quickly end this conflict, I just do not think that the Tigrey will go down quietly or quickly. I believe that the gov will vote to renew the state of emergency and I am giving it a 65% chance of happening, but I will also be watching the fighting and Ahmed's words to update the forecast."
