How much a relatively mature nuclear power needs, desires, and can afford new warheads every 3 years is questionable. 2. Increasingly testing can be replaced by computer modeling and simulation, although admittedly this is still imperfect, NK increasingly may have the programming capacity. Testing/modelling can also be replaced by industrial stealing/trade of proven designs. 3. Ongoing talks, needs for investment, opening of FTZs, a more open society, pressure from neighbor China, signs of willingness to negotiate nuclear issues, etc., decrease chances in this question for the next 12 months, relative to the missile question because there there is uncertainty generated because NK can somewhat claim the right to a space program.

With roughly 1.1 years until the deadline I'll establish a base rate of 33% = (30% x 1.1). Reports from South Korea intelligence suggest NK is preparing for another test, so I'll adjust up to 36%."

It appears that each successive test has increased the yield compared to the previous test by almost 100%. Assuming that nuclear development is underway, the next atomic test will be at least 12-15 kt. This will require approximately 1 pound of enriched U-235 - which involves hundreds if not thousands of gas centrifuges spinning down uranium hexafluoride."

Does the regime seek attention or have a larger goal with which to leverage the threat or reality of a test? Winter is coming and it is almost always stressful on the North Korean economy and food distribution system. Depending on the state of the harvests and the forecasts for winter, a test might be seen as a way to get needed aid. Conversely a test may be seen as too much of a threat to such assistance, especially from their Chinese neighbors. It also may be seen as useful in solidifying the regime domestically. There are a lot of angles on this issue and thus it is a tossup."
