How many fatalities will result from fighting between the armed forces of Azerbaijan and either the Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army or the armed forces of Armenia between 20 June 2017 and 1 July 2018?,2017-06-20T17:00:01Z,2018-06-30T06:59:01Z,10-99 ,"['Fewer than 10 ', '10-99 ', '100-999 ', '1,000 or more']",['Security and Conflict'],753,654,152,237,"All fatalities resulting from the fighting, including civilians and third party actors will count. The once “frozen” conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenian separatists in Nagorno-Karabakh has shown signs of escalation (Reuters, Aljazeera, Council on Foreign Relations). The answer options represent different orders of magnitude of conflict escalation. Fatality estimates often vary across sources and are typically reported in ranges. If the fatality estimates from open source media coverage produce a range that crosses two of the answer bins, GJ will generally use the higher end of the range to determine the resolution of the question, but will also consider the number of sources that put the high end of the range within each bin as well as how much of the total range falls within each bin.

Estimates for the entirety of 2017 show about 50 combat deaths, which included 2 deadly attacks in February (not included in the time period for the question). Since June 2017, fighting in the region has been mostly limited to occasional skirmishes and disputes. Although data on all fatalities (not just combat) is not readily available, I would expect that lower levels of fighting between either Armenia or Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan would result in a reduced number of civilian and third-party casualties as well. The number of fatalities for this time period is already in the 10-99 range and there is a low chance fatalities will exceed 99 in the given time period due to this reduced fighting. For this reason, I think there is an 88% chance that between 20 June 2017 and 1 July 2018 there will be 10-99 fatalities and only a 12% chance for 100-999 fatalities. I think there is a 0% chance for 1,000 or more fatalities because that would require a scale of fighting that would severely interrupt oil and gas exports in the region, which goes against the broader interests Azerbaijan. https://www.cfr.org/interactives/global-conflict-tracker?marker=23#!/conflict/nagorno-karabakh-conflict https://eurasianet.org/s/karabakh-more-relative-calm-ahead-in-2018"

It was clearly seen in 2015/2016 when Turkey downed Russian fighter jet over Syria conflict in Nagorno Karabakh escalated and casualties skyrocketed. After 2016 failed coup in Turkey relations between Putin and Erdogan improved significantly. Probably thanks to the fact that Putin warned Erdogan. Why he did it despite recently dawned plane? Putin needed ally in Syria rather then foe as well as he took opportunity to create disagreement among strong NATO members Turkey and USA. Now Erdogans blames USA for supporting failed coup."
