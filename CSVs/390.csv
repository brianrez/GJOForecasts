If London admissions remain below 400, it could mean no legally enforced restrictions are needed after Christmas, although there could be tougher guidance announced by the Prime Minister on 27 December. Hospital admissions in London are not the only metric being used to assess the severity of Omicron, but is a key measure. Separately, the UK Health Security Agency will produce early data on severity, analysing vaccination status and age of people admitted to hospital with the Omicron variant, which is also expected before Christmas Eve. However the situation is still fluid, and ministers stress that all options remain in reserve if hospitals come under serious pressure over the New Year.""

101031,2021-12-20T20:30:51Z,22,[70.0],[5.0],It sounds like restrictions are coming but what type will they be? I think that it could be difficult to tell if they are legal restrictions or not does this require an act of parliament to be passed? does that require parliament to be recalled from recess? Can they just do it within the caucus and have it be legal under the health act?. I don't think that schools will be legal restrictions - more operational so I am not counting on them resolving the question yes. I suspect that there could be situations where they restrict 'types' of people rather than 'numbers' of people. ie all unvaccinated people must stay at home and accept no visitors but those who have got their booster (which they have offered to every person in UK) can have less restricted access to things. In this case the number of people hasn't been restricted to vaccinated households. It will be interesting to see how GJO interprets curfews if they are put in place. In my own judgement (anticipating GJOs response to anyone's question on this...) I think that they are not restricting the number of people just the timing that those people can mix so I don't think they should count.

I have broken the forecast down to a number of sections in my mind: 1. when will cases increase to a point that new, more stringent public health measures will be required. This would probably be driven by omicron as there was unlikely to be any major new factors that increase delta infections until Christmas and a possible winter surge. Another GJO question on covid variants in the US gives a low probability that Omicron will become the dominant strain in the US before mid January https://www.gjopen.com/questions/2095-when-will-a-sars-cov-2-variant-other-than-delta-next-represent-more-than-70-0-of-total-covid-19-cases-in-the-us 2. Is there political will to begin new, more stringent public health measures - starting to see it with vaccination drives and mask mandates but I feel that there will be low public acceptance of precautionary measures unless justified by an increase in deaths and the health system being overwhelmed. considering there is less than 5 weeks to go it seems unlikely to be able to justify the measures in that time. It will take 2 to 3 weeks until we get a good idea of the transmissibility and re-infection risk and then it will take a couple of weeks to make a cabinet decision. Restrictions immediately before Christmas could be deeply unpopular."

However, the health secretary said there is no work from home rule 'as of yet.' Sporting events and arena-type events and religious gatherings may need more pushing by government to get to ""close down"" should Omicron* grow. And it seems to me that the cases are just trickling upward. There seems to be some support for more restrictions, ironically. I guess some people would not mind restrictions given the current circumstances. On the other hand, restricting travel and in-person gathering for the Holidays would be such a disappointment. On the OTHER hand, there could be a restriction toward members not living in the same household, in which members living within the same household can still spend the holidays together."

The government has shown from previous serious waves that they will enact restrictions when health leaders tell them it is necessary. On the other hand, cases are not rising slowly, and natural immunity+vaccine immunity could bring cases and hospitalisations down, hence there is doubt that this prediction will happen."

Clearly we are in a different place now due to the vaccine but we know immunity wanes after around six months, so the pace of the booster programme will be key in slowing the rate of hospital admissions. This seems to be ramping up now (223,000 booster jabs on 21/10 compared to 190,000 a week before), with public health campaigns and eligiability conditions being eased in the last few days.

There have been 8 variants identified, all of them in 2020 - even the Delta variant was first identified in Nov 2020 (https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n1971) 8 variants in 2020. None so far in 2021. You’d expect at least 1 to turn up but it would also need to be worse than others and they typically take time to spread. (E.g. Delta took four or five months to reach the UK). 2) The Delta variant is largely hitting unvaccinated people for now in terms of ICU cases anyway in Switzerland which only has 50% vaccination rates. Infection rates in the UK are also dropping. So I think that is also unlikely. 3) low vaccination hotspots… I could not find evidence of this in the UK so I think this is again a small chance. That said - The public is now used to restrictions so the government of the UK will be confident that there will be compliance. The law could state no more than 1000 people for instance if the event does not check COVID certs ( similar to Switzerland). So it would not be that restrictive.
