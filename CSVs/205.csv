Just my own scan of historic approval ratings confirms the suspicion that breaking below 38.5% is highly unusual. So I'll start with a base scenario of 5%. That said it does look like Jimmy Carter's approval rating sank below that threshold during the stagflation crisis (rising rates / energy crisis / geopolitical risk). So I am elevating the likelihood given the comparability to today. Not for nothing either but there's a lot of market commentary about today's market environment and 1994 (rising inflation and a Fed raising interest rates into a mid-term year)...Clinton did see his approval drop a touch below 40%, but not through 38.5% (though he started the year at a better approval rating than Biden).

80790,2022-03-16T21:54:56Z,1,[2.0],[2.0],"Biden popularity has been pretty stable between 40pc and 45pc. Given that views in the US are so party oriented, views on the president are pretty fixed and it will take a big shock to move the numbers substantially. There will definitely a bit of a boost in support at the moment due to what is happening in Europe, and also over time popularity tends to wane. And there is plenty of opportunity for a major blunder or mistake. But I feel it would have to be a big event for popularity to drop this far."
24440,2022-03-16T21:17:53Z,1,[33.0],[33.0],"Looking back at the polls for former presidents on the 538 site, three presidents (Trump, Clinton, and Ford) seemed to drop below 39% approval in their first two years, with a few others closer or doing so later (HW Bush, Reagan, Carter). Only three of the last nine never dipped that low (Obama, W Bush, and Nixon). From the current 42$ level, Biden does not have much room. Inflation seems to be a current challenge for him, with some positives coming from the current COVID situation and his response to Putin's invasion of Ukraine. All of those could change. The coming mid-term election is likely to lead candidates to criticize the current situation, leading to criticism of Biden himself. Helpful perspectives also from @cpschneider [1] and @Deerslayer [2]."

If the average delince rate is continuing as it has since July 2021, it seems unlikely that his approval rate will lose another 4.3% in 3 months. However, non-linear developments of the approval rate are possible. Historic data suggest (visual inspection of the lower part of the website), that such changes can go in both direction, but seem equally likely to be positive as negative. Nevertheless 38.5 % would be a low in recenty history after roughly 500 days. The outside view therefore suggests a low probability. Given the current circumstance, a increased decline rate can not fully excluded, even though approval rates of other Presidents generally seem to have profited from wars in other countries."
