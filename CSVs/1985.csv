Will there be a new episode of mass killing in Myanmar before 1 January 2017?,2016-02-02T18:00:24Z,2016-12-31T18:00:54Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],1404,654,385,237,"For more information on what constitutes an episode of mass killing, see the Early Warning Project’s Definitions page. We consider Myanmar to already be experiencing a mass killing episode perpetrated by the state and targeting separatist groups and the Karen (EWP Myanmar). We are specifically asking about new episodes of mass killing with different targets (e.g., the Rohingya) or perpetrators (Reuters). The Early Warning Project’s 2015 statistical risk assessments identify Myanmar as the country with the greatest risk of an onset of new state-led mass killing. Those forecasts do not assess the risk of mass killing by non-state groups, which would also produce a “yes” answer to this question. This question will be resolved by the Early Warning Project, in consultation with subject matter experts, using publicly available secondary sources. If the project determines that a new episode of mass killing has occurred, relevant evidence will be summarized in a post on EWP's blog. Recommended Question Will a member of the National League for Democracy (NLD) take office as president of Myanmar before April 2016? This question was closed as ""no"" with an end date of 31 December 2016. The EWP did not find evidence of a new mass killing episode in Myanmar in 2016(Early Warning Project).

The peace dialogue will probably exacerbate the divisions between signatories and non-signatories of the National Ceasefire Agreement and between bigger and smaller ethnic groups. This could be further fueled by the release of the Census data on ethnicity and religion. The recent election of U Htin Kyaw as president shows Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's extra self-confidence and willingness to hold control over all decisions and her resistance in delegating power. The challenges ahead would require a much higher degree of inclusion in decision making that can actually be a threat. There is concern and understanding among the international community of these challenges and this might mitigate the risk, which is anyway high at 66%."

The sector accounts for 44 percent of economic output, according to consulting firm McKinsey & Co. All land is owned by the government but farmers are given land use or tillage rights, making land use a particularly sensitive issue for small-scale farmers who make up the majority of the country's population of 51 million. Yet these rights are neither respected on the ground in practice, nor provide protection against land grabbing, activists said."

While the NLD's new majority in office will help to curb outbreaks toward Karen and other Burmese groups this sub group may likely be at more risk to violence from more than just state groups as they are also a religious minority. Thus according to the definition on this question, it's likely that between state groups and others in a culture used to this kind of treatment of minority groups, reaching 1,000 deaths by January 1, 2017 is a real possibility. By definition on this question taking into consideration threats from state and non-state groups 1,000 deaths is not that hard to reach unfortunately."

Indeed the murder rate is quite high (>8000 in 2012), but much of this seems to be driven by the large drug trade and lesser based on racial cleansing. Even reports I have red by the Wirathu, the leader of 969 seem not to encourage violence predominantly, but rather seem concerned with the political issue of whether these people should be granted citizenship. The recent election of a more moderate government, with the massive defeat of the anti-islamic coalition seem to suggest that people disagree with the more extreme views of this party. Deaths at the rates exceeding the amount defined here (1000) seem to have not happened here since the 1930s, and thus it seems somewhat unlikely that it would occur in the next year, barring some unforeseen act of violence by a muslim against a buddhist (seems the 2013 case was brought about the supposed rape of a buddhist woman by 3 muslim men).

Need to do more reading on the significance of Aung San Suu Kyi's historic involvement in the parliament this time around. Things look messy enough to push me a bit over into the yes territory. I'm curious how much the appointment of a new president will affect things in March."

There's heaps about the number of refugees, or the number displaced, but practically nothing credible about the total number *killed* in that specific year. The most useful information I can find is a Jan 2015 LA Times article, which says that 240 Muslims have been killed in Myanmar over the last 2 years.
