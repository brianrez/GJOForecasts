I don't think he's going to rushing himself, seeing as both he and the show-runners have acknowledged that the story-lines of the book and show are going to start seriously diverging in season 6. He also said that he missed a deadline that he and his publisher had set for the end of last year, so unless all of this is just a media stunt and he decides to drop the book at the same time as the airing of GOT, it's really probably not going to come out."

He noted at the time that there was months left to go of writing, if the writing went well. Game of Thrones Season 6 is scheduled to be released on April 24th. The statement that George R. R. Martin made implied that he had months, plural, so even if that means he had 3 months of writing left there is still printing process and presumably editing. Printing that many copies of a book would take a bit of time, not unreasonable so to assume at least 1 month. So if George R. R. Martin were to published his book before season 6 the book would need to be delivered to the printing press by March 23rd (if not earlier) so that it could hit bookstores on April 23rd."

Besides the fact that Martin writes painfully slowly and is clearly a perfectionist with some pretty odd quirks, there are many indications that he is contractually obligated to do whatever is in the best interests of the show at this point. Releasing the book before the season is well and truly over would be equivalent to a huge spoiler of the entire plot for season 6. It would shift focus and profits away from the show, and therefore while I believe that he has most likely already finished writing the book at some point in 2015, the book will be released around the time season 6 is finishing or perhaps even later. To sum up, it is all about money at this point. Martin has nothing to lose by releasing later - he has his huge payout and royalties from the show regardless and people who were going to read the book will still read it. The makers of the show stand to lose a lot of money on the other hand should the book be released first, therefore this will not happen."

I think it much more likely season 6 will be a part of the 6th book and act as a taster for the whole book coming out. season seven will finish adapting the 6th book. The only thing I see as being another possibility is a simultaneous release date.

Also, the TV show can be done with a reasonably complete manuscript, whereas for the book to published, the manuscript must obviously be complete and fully typeset, proofed. printed and shipped etc (though a Kindle edition could arrive faster if they really wanted to make a deadline), so far statements that a manuscript exists, doesn't mean that the book is necessarily ready (though it will be close). Also, Amazon are now getting pretty good at knowing when books are coming and taking pre-orders for them so the fact they have nothing listed on their site is a concern. And, in terms of base rates, the last two books took more than 5 years, so that makes this next one summer 2016 (though earlier books did take under 3 years).

There seem to be scattered rumours, but GRRM recently said that the TWOW is still being written [1]. The crowd consensus seems rather high given the absence of evidence; I think many of us (me included) hope the book will be released as soon as possible, and that is skewing judgments. I am thus going with a lower-than-the-crowd estimate."

Martin's sixth book, ""Winds of Winter."" The book is a part of the ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series, which the HBO hit TV show, ""Games of Thrones"" is based on. A Polish website, via Winteriscoming.net, reportedly claimed that translator Michal Jakuszewski is expecting to receive the manuscript by the end of the year so that he can start translating the book into Polish. Fans are hoping that this latest report means that the book will be released within the next few months."

That being said, I'm persuaded by Khalid that GRRM likely doesn't want to be front-run by his own TV show. His publishers surely do not -- but they might not have that much leverage with as big a name as GRRM."
