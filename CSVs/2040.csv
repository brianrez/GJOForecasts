This is not a simple succession struggle between MBN (CIA favorite) and MBS (youth gone wild). This is a complex conflict among powerful family factions and the stakes are high. The continuing existence of the House of Saud could be on the line. Succession is only the proxy question. Reaching consensus on an effective strategic vision for Saudi Arabia is the real question. Rumors about a quick succession quicken the pulse. But it seems more likely that the difficult internal argument about the real question will run on for a while.

As such the likelihood of abidication is low (though not zero as the challenges faced by the Kindgom are mounting due to a continued low oil prices, increased tensions with Iran and a backlash against the consolidation of power in the hands of the King, Crown Prince and Deputy Crown Prince which could force a change. In addition, there are rumors that the King is making moves to abdicate in favour of his son. (Estimate for probability of abdication - 4%) Death of the King: the current King is 80 years old, has suffered a previous stroke and is reportedly in poor health (though this is strongly denied) so the risk of death is relatively high but hard to predict in the coming 6 months - set at 35% chance).

What does your consensus forecast under the ""Current Forecasts"" tab show for the ""No"" selection to this Question? Mine shows 98.96% for the current consensus ""No"" selection. That seemed awfully high to me. So, I just scanned the historical forecasts to this Question. If you do the same, doesn't it seem to you that it's impossible to end up with a 98.96 consensus given the collection of specific historical entries for the ""No"" selection? (As I'm looking at it now, there are two 50% forecasts on this one web page. Just these two forecasts alone would require NINETY-FIVE other 100% forecasts of ""No"" to offset them -- and bring the average to approximately 98.86 for the combined ninety-seven forecasts.) If you wouldn't mind, I wonder if you'd take the time to scan the historical forecasts and see what you think; whether you either agree or disagree that 98.86 is impossible, I'd like to know. I'd hate to have to do the math if I am obviously right or wrong."

According to Wikipedia, ""In 2008, the Saudi Foreign Minister, prince Saud Al Faisal secretly proposed setting up an Arab military force to fight Hezbollah in Lebanon with the help of the United States, UN and NATO."""

When Saudi Kings develop terminal disease, they don't have to worry about hospital length-of-stay. Salman's predecessor may have been hospitalized for nearly a year before he finally succumbed. It seems more likely that Salman is not hospitalized, and therefore not in any immediate crisis. He may be getting what amounts to a nursing home level of care. Of course, if you are a Saudi King, you don't have to go to a nursing home. You receive that type of care in your own residence. The average skilled nursing facility stay in the United States runs about 3 years. So Salman might have a decent 2/3 shot of surviving one year from last Spring.

And if Salman does die, it seems almost certain that Mohammed bin Nayef will be his successor, barring something like an assassination.

If King Salman lives to June of 2016, he will exceed the average life of Saudi Kings by only 2-3%. Saudi royals frequently have cardiovascular disease. Salman is partially paralyzed after a stroke. He had spinal surgery in 2011. There are rumors that he may have dementia, or possibly some type of aphasia. He may be unable to function as King even though his reign began just this past January. In April, Mohammed bin Nayef was named Crown Prince and Mohammed bin Salman was named Deputy Crown Prince, so the line of succession is clear. Apparently, day-to-day operations have been transferred to these two. King Salman himself may be in the equivalent of a nursing home situation. The average survival time in full custodial care tends to be about 3 years.

Here are just a few items I suggest are at least interesting to consider: 1) I believe we can safely assume that ""financial assets"" are those that, upon instruction, can be converted into cash in some reasonable time. Generally liquid assets, cash and near-cash equivalents. Let's just say everything but hard assets (physical property). 2) Reports have it that the Saudi fortune, the so-called sovereign fund, which is entwined with the Kingdom, has experienced financial asset redemptions of anywhere from 12.5 to 20% over the course of the past twelve months. That is, simplistically speaking, the Saudi royals are calling their brokers with instructions to sell shares and send them the money. These redemptions, presumably, are going to expenses. The Saudis are, apparently, spending money far more rapidly than they are bringing it in. 3) Simultaneously, we have the story that the Saudi ""strategy"" of flooding the market with cheap oil is oh-so ""successful."" Everything must be done to preserve ""market share."" Well, if you just stop to think about it, the basic idea of a market share strategy in a natural resource commodity market is rather ludicrous. Sure, there are the logistical relationships, and the financial pressure placed on competitors. etc. But a natural resource commodity market has certain characteristics. a) The commodities, unlike, say, a factory that is tooled to produce automobiles, do not go away when the owners go bankrupt. New owners come in, but the commodities, in this case oil, remain. b) In such a commodities market, buyers take whatever is offered by whomever it is offered. The fact that you sold me oil last month at the best price (for which I paid and thanked you) should have little impact on whom I buy oil from this month. A marketshare strategy in a natural resource commodities market is, frankly, baloney. Since (Units Sold [Market Share] x Price/Unit) = Income is the inescapable economic equation, we see that this strategy of maximizing/maintaining market share is only half the equation. The rational goal is to maximize income, not market share. Rather than suggesting the Saudis are irrational, I suggest that the story of maximizing marketshare be recognized as only a component in some larger scheme; and considered by itself as only a ruse, a cover story. But a cover story for what? At the surface, it would be a cover story for the Saudis' massive depletion of their financial assets. Lacking such a story, the world would have wondered where the Saudis were suddenly taking such a large percentage of their wealth. They are doing something with it, but what? What expenses have they converted their redemptions into? Yes, there are expenses of the Kingdom -- but what goes elsewhere in the wash? What activities would require such massively large secretive funding? 4) Just for speculative consideration, couched in pure hyperbole for emphasis: What is it that the Saudis want so desperately that they are willing to spend hundreds of billions in bribery to obtain? And, who would be in a position to provide it for them?"

Fahd, as before, was succeeded by his brother Abdullah and Abdullah succeeded by his brother Salman, the current King. Salman appointed his half-brother Muqrin as Crown Prince in January 2015 and removed him in April 2015 because it would have caused Dynastic Instability, meaning that the Monarchy could have ended up because Princes who were becoming Kings were in their old age. Even Abdulaziz's youngest son was to turn 70 in 2015. Abdulaziz, in 1920, had said that the further succession would be from brother-to-brother not from father-to-son. King Salman ended the brother-to-brother succession and appointed his 56-year-old nephew Muhammad bin Nayef as Crown Prince in April 2015. He appointed his young son Mohammad, who is believed to be 30 years old (in 2015), as Deputy Crown Prince, thus making the next succession from cousin-to-brother, as Mohammad is the cousin of Crown Prince Muhammad.»"

Apart from the need of the regime to maintain appearances, dignity, etc, which a palace coup might threaten, such a measure might hint too overtly at weaknesses in the regime, and thus give succour to domestic (violent) opponents."

However, Saudi kings seems to hold on until the last possible moment, and I'm sure no efforts will be spared to keep him alive and on the throne, even as a figurehead. MUQ appears to be out of the running, and if SAL succeeded it would mean the first father-to-son succession since ibn Saud himself died. I think a father-to-son succession would cause instability, since so many male descendants would suddenly find themselves cut out of the succession. That leaves NAY, who is slated as successor anyway. If there's anyone else in the running, I don't know who it is."
