The latest move, back in February 2022, President Saied dissolved the Supreme Judicial Council. President Saied has control of the central government and most of the military. And has been periodically consolidating power since July 2021 when he suspended parliament and ousted the Prime Minister. There has been little push back from the international community to include the U.S. Further, despite increasing protests from Tunisians, there has been little to no yield of power or control by President Saied – a man who compares himself to Charles de Gaulle. However, Tunisia's powerful general labor union has recently stated that it would hold a national strike over wages and the economy. This strike could lead to more uproar and potentially spark a revolution led by the people overthrowing the president and his authoritarian dictatorship. However, the likelihood is low."

However, I believe it will either happen in July or it will not happen at all."

This would be a first verifiable indication that the Saied roadmap/timeline might actually be followed. In parallel, one of the most important precursor indications of adherence to the July 25 timeframe will be how the opposition groups choose to act: whether or not the various groups choose to actually go along with the “roadmap” plan (with the aim of creating pro-democracy impacts from within the system Saied is trying to establish), or if they fight it more openly to try and impose their own alternative plan to exit the current unconstitutional/undemocratic situation.

One issue is that the consultation that is currently being held by Tunisia is online and therefore not inclusive for those who don't have access to the internet, causing discontent. Another issue is the President's autocratic actions which have shifted Tunisia to a more centralized government. Both of these issues, along with others, have created a political divide in the country. With that being said, the President still has support and consultations are happening as he promised, which leads me to believe that the rest of the President's agenda would be carried out as promised as well."
