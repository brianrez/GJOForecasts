Kennedy was considered by many to be the court's swing vote, often casting the deciding vote between the court's more conservative and liberal members. His retirement will allow President Donald Trump (R) an opportunity to make his second appointment to the nation's highest court."

In orals, counsel for Friedrichs acknowledged that a public employer could pay a union’s agency fees directly, rather than the more convoluted system of paying employees and then deducting agency fees from payroll. While I expect that a slim majority are troubled enough by Abood to seek to amend and curtail it, it is possible that will not result in making any and all mandatory agency fees unconstitutional. I assess the likelihood of an amendment and/or curtailment of Abood at 80%, if so, the likelihood of total abolition of mandatory agency fees by public employers 75%.
