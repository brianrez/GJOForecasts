Given the 17th is fast approaching I'm not sure they'll be able to overcome the objections raised by certain Senators."

After all, the Senate was designed to be a more stable institution than the House, more conservative, and more resistant to change, be the bulwark against the vicissitudes of popular opinion, ""the saucer that cools the tea"" as Washington called it. * I was overly optimistic because I believe the bill to have bipartisan appeal and be uncontroversial. Takeaway - another good reminder that large pieces of legislation have plenty of provisions that can run individual senators the wrong way (e.g. homeschooling funding in this bill) * The procedure of unanimous consent in the Senate is a high bar to clear"

Or he could just want to go home, use the matter to campaign through August, and ""git 'er done"" when they come back in September. Estimates are 1.7MM kids out of 5.3MM kids 5-17 are home schooled in TX - 2nd only to CA Given very tough race against Beto last year - might be profitable for him to trumpet that about in August."

The Senate has its own retirement reform bill called RESA. Normally the two versions will have to go through a long process of reconciliation to work out their differences. However, the Senate decided to forgo this length process. Instead it opted for the ""unanimous consent"" approach in which the bill will be passed in the Senate if everybody agrees. This would have speed up the passing of the bill significantly. However, Ted Cruz objected (placed a hold on the bill) due to his disagreement with the 529 plan in the SECURE Act."
