Will there be a new episode of mass killing in Burundi before 1 January 2017?,2016-02-02T18:00:49Z,2016-12-31T18:00:57Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],1768,654,278,237,"For more information on what constitutes an episode of mass killing, see the Early Warning Project’s Definitions page. Violence erupted in Burundi in May 2015 following an attempted coup after President Pierre Nkurunziza announced he was running for a third term. It has continued since then (BBC). The Early Warning Project’s 2015 statistical risk assessments identify Burundi as one of the top 60 countries with the greatest risk of an onset of state-led mass killing. Those forecasts do not assess the risk of mass killing by non-state groups, which would also produce a “yes” answer to this question. This question will be resolved by the Early Warning Project, in consultation with subject matter experts, using publicly available secondary sources. If the project determines that a new episode of mass killing has occurred, relevant evidence will be summarized in a post on EWP's blog. Recommended Question Who will win Uganda's next presidential election? This question was closed as a ""no"" with an end date of 31 December 2016. The EWP did not find evidence of a new mass killing episode in Burundi before the end of 2016 (Early Warning Project).

ACLED has 11 total fatalities from August 2016 (all types of violence by all actors). The insurgency seems to have puttered out. Absent a major insurgent offensive, or some type of regional intervention (highly unlikely) this will not occur. Only reason I give it a 3% and not a 1% is that we have seen sudden spikes of massive civilian killings in Burundi in the past. Although worth pointing out that those prior episodes were perpetrated by Tutsi-ed governments targeting Hutus, and Hutus are now in control."

At the same time Pierre Nkurunziza was going for his third term last year Burundi on 29 April 2015 issued a statement that the Burundi currency will be replaced by a new currency and all old currency will lose legal tender status soon after. I really thought this was interesting. I was in Iraq in 2004 when the CPA replaced the old Iraqi Dinar with a new Iraqi Dinar. People with Dinar had to exchange the old Dinar for new Dinar within a time period just like Burundi last year. Let your imagination run wild who may have hoarded the old Dinar. With any nation takeover a form of economics must be planned for. That means a form of exchange; paper currency, coins, gold, labor, whatever. In the case of modern economics and finance currency is a favorite. It took a bit of researching but I think http://securamonde.com/ (Secura Monde International ""SMI"") made Burundi's new currency which is located right outside of London England. A western nation company seems to have supported Pierre Nkurunziza third term for President of Burundi. I wonder if part of the reason refugees left Burundi for other nations is because they could not exchange their currency secondary to ethnic discrimination. If this is the case I suspect deaths will be less common going forward."

They know their country better than I do, so if the government think things are stable enough at home to invest outside, I have to give them a point or two."

These UN positions are highly sought after because they pay exponentially (10x) more than any job in Burundi. NPR reported how a Burundi soldier at home can get a UN posting saying, ""to win these posts, a soldier has to pledge loyalty to Burundi's government...there have been some in the military who believe that if they engage in violence — violently suppress opposition or the rebellion — they will be able to reap the reward of their allegiance by being sent abroad"" (2). Last week the EU reported cutting Burundis funding for peacekeepers. I wanted to know the details of this story. It seems the EU/UN pays one thousand dollars per month to Burundi per soldier sent abroad. The state of Burundi keeps two hundred dollars of that and eight hundred goes to the soldiers. What was cut was the two hundred dollars to the State of Burundi (3). Two days ago the UN Security Council approved a Police force to mitigate violence in Burundi, the UN placed a timeline of fifteen days for various courses of action (4). Unfortunately, UN Peacekeepers are in the news the past week for sexual assaults and rape (5,6)."

The report mentions a change in tactics from the government returning bodies to the streets to hiding the bodies and becoming silent on the location of the abducted and whether or not the civilians are in custody or are disappeared. The UN is sending a token police force, they say. Or maybe not, as the resolution has no direction, and the Burundi government approved of the resolution with some demands that the UN may not accept. As stated in an earlier rationale, the president of Burundi views another outside military force as an invasion. With any 'invasion' he will blame 'enemies of the state' who support them and will employ that excuse to persecute them. He will gather his supporters who have an interest in keeping him in office to protest and take action and they, in turn, will have their street supporters do whatever is necessary to protect the president. If he is involuntarily removed, it becomes an existential moment for his supporters. There is a reason hundreds of thousands became refugees and, in Burundi with its corruption and reactionary climate, it is not difficult for oppositions to kill 1,000 citizens in a forecast span."

The most consistent thread I can discern at all is basic government vs opposition, but a line count of ACLED data actually puts those deaths between 250-300 since armed / combatant deaths don't count. A recent IBT article touches on these last two thoughts as well ""..Stanton alleged it the [genocide] case could be currently made for Burundi, despite many claiming the violence is not entirely conflict based, but socio-politically motivated...when they verified that 439 people had been killed just in the past several months – that people are selectively killed, and those killing are essentially trying to destroy the leadership of the other group, most of these people being Tutsi in this case."""

Today's decision makes clear that for our relations to be fully resumed we expect a number of concrete measures to be carried out. The action we are seeking is achievable with will and determination: it builds on measures and processes already set in motion by the African Union, the East African Community and the United Nations, and welcomed by the 5 African Heads of State mandated by the African Union. In particular we believe it can support the inter-Burundian dialogue mediated by the East African Community which is key to finding a durable political solution to the crisis."""

However today the US assistant secretary for state on Africa reported that it believes neighboring Rwanda has been actively trying to destabilize the government in Burundi (1). Given that both countries have presidents which refuse term limits, and in Burundi a military that is actively attempting coupes, it seems like a very unstable situation. Add to this the fact that the minority RPF (Tutsis) currently lead Rwanda and the CNDD–FDD (Hutus) currently lead Burundi and it seems like violence in this region in part revenge for the 1994 genocide seems inevitable. Any perceived act of violence of one group against a political or military leader of the other could easily escalate this to genocide levels of deaths."
