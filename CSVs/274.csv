88452,2022-06-14T22:25:31Z,11,[100.0],[0.0],"""Corporate CreditMONTHLY REVIEWCredit spreads widened in April with general market volatility elevated once again amidst heightened macro uncertainty. News in the month continued to be dominated by the conflict between Russia/Ukraine where no progress was made towards a resolution. Credit markets saw weak technicals with demand limited by the negative price action in fixed income as risk free yields rose. Supply in April was significantly down.The high yield market was particularly weak in April. Over the month, the average yield climbed and the average spread grew significantly amidst a sharp jump in Treasury yields and weak technical conditions. Growing concern over the eventual economic impact from aggressive tightening of monetary conditions and the potential for an eventual “hard landing” prompted investors to reassess exposure to the lowest-rated segments of the high yield market. The top performing sectors for the month were transportation, other industrial and basic industry.Global convertibles fell the most in two years as concerns over inflation, interest rates and corporate earnings rattled markets. Convertibles, however, did outperform both of its underlying components. The convertibles market is now priced far closer to bonds than stocks as a lot of paper trades below par with less equity delta and more yield to maturity.OUTLOOKWe see spreads likely to be rangebound. Markets are supported by more attractive valuations and strong corporate results yet constrained by the macro uncertainties and weak technicals given the lack of demand while market volatility remains high. We are cautious on the high yield market, which has experienced significant pockets of volatility this year and there is little to suggest the environment for high yield will be become materially more supportive over the near term."""
