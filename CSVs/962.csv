While there is a clear social upheaval due to coronavirus, unemployment and racial divides which have rallied people to demand change, the electoral college still remains exactly the same. This creates an uphill battle for Democrats who need to flip red states. In a time of uncertainty some voters may vote for what they know. In addition, the worldwide push( especially European countries) towards nationalism and right wing extremist propaganda creates a larger narrative for people in this age of social media and technology. These platforms allow for extremist groups to connect and mobilize. Especially with lockdowns in place, and large scale government involvement on day to day activities at the state and federal level these groups may surge to rise in the vote as a shocking underbelly of the population. Overall, the odds are in favor of Biden who has proven to follow traditional lines of the Democratic Party separating himself from more socialist and far left policies and as a middle ground, president for all. To say he is in the clear however would be an underestimation of voter potential."

Out of the last 58 elections, 53 Presidents won both the electoral college and popular vote so the base rate for p(PV win & EC win) = 0.914. Biden is favored in the polls and will likely win the popular vote. Using a conservative 80% probability of a Biden popular vote win from 538, my estimates are around 98% for this question. Also, qualitatively integrating opinions from @Balzac @cafebedouin and @LokiOdinevich. I think the crowd is underestimating the probability of this question, which may be due to the availability bias/heuristic where people tend to overestimate the likelihood of information/ events that are more easily recalled and/or more recent (e.g., the recent 2000 and 2016 elections with EC win != PV win)."

The polls will need to show a far greater swing to Biden if this is to be avoided and the debates are likely to narrow the polls not broaden them."

94632,2020-08-26T15:27:44Z,4,[95.0],[0.0],"As of yesterday, 270towins polling and consensus maps showed Biden with 262 and 278 electoral seats either safe or leaning Dem, respectively. Compared with Trump's 119 and 169 seats classified as safe or leaning Rep, this is a fairly decisive statement. If the consensus is correct, Biden doesn't need to win a single toss-up state to win the election (though it is unlikely he would bat 0% given his strong performances in each of the 5 so far). The polling map is bleaker, but still shows Biden needing only 8 points to pass the 270 threshold, which is again very doable given his current status in 'toss-up' states. Interestingly, polling actually has Texas classified as a toss-up, and a Dem victory there would mean an EC victory overall was all but certain. Biden is also up by a fair margin in virtually all non-partisan (and even most partisan) polls around the nation, suggesting he is the candidate more likely to take the popular vote. Given those two scenarios, it seems fairly likely that either (a) things will hold and Biden will take both or (b) Trump will find a way to bring voters to his side en masse, potentially taking both the popular vote and EC as well."

Most Americans certainly seem to be fed up with Trump's antics, and have ""Trump Fatigue"". Biden simply needs to hang around until the election, and he will win both the popular vote and an electoral college landslide."

No Democratic candidate has achieved this, at least in modern history.

Though if Trump does win the electoral college I would expect him to do so once again without winning the popular vote. In fact I believe he would win with an even smaller fraction of the popular vote than in 2016. Sources show that loser of popular vote in close elections has a better chance of winning the electoral college than would be expected, and that the trend benefits Republicans 77% of the time. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_elections_in_which_the_winner_lost_the_popular_vote https://news.utexas.edu/2019/09/23/in-a-close-race-the-less-popular-candidate-has-a-45-chance-of-becoming-president/ https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/"

The winner of the Electoral College has won the popular vote in 53 out of the 58 US Presidential elections ever held - 91.3 percent. [1] Of course, last time around, this did not happen. It is one of the only four elections when this did not occur. The real insight here comes if we look a little further. Of the the elections held immediately following (1880, 1892, 2004) for which we have results, the incumbent president or his party went on to win twice (66%).[2]. How does this compare to overall incumbent advantage? Nineteen presidents have sought re-election since 1900 and only 5 (Bush Sr, Carter, Ford, Hoover and Taft) have lost. This gives the incumbent a a 73 percent chance of winning on average, slightly more than the previous statistic. [3] These are extraordinary times however and only one of the five Presidents to run for re-election during a recession has won (20%).[4] Obviously, the question is not ""Will Trump get re-elected?"" but it is still a statstic worthy of note in trying to calculate a base rate."

Thus, I give Trump about a 55% edge of winning the Electoral College, but I don’t think he wins the popular vote more than 5% of the time.

Their path to victory is not through the popular vote. Interpret everything they do as being aimed at a few focal points that can tip the EC. Putting cash into the hands of citizens/voters in response to covid-19 has a strong electoral focus to it. If Trump doesn't do that he will lose both the EC and PV; with those payments he is in with a chance.

CV19 is an exogenous shock that dwarfs all other shocks. There will be cataclysmic outcomes for the economy at most all levels which will coincide with the campaign. While Biden has weaknesses as a candidate he is likely to coalesce the democratic vote and may gain in Red states that will be hit particularly badly such bas Florida and Arizona. I would say it's a high likelihood the democrats would win the popular vote based on recent trends. I am putting this at 75% for now. It may go lower depending on how CV19 plays out. Even being conservative and taking away external factors one would place the odds at 50 50 to win the EC right now I would say odds are 75 25 for popular vote to Biden.

If Biden beats Trump by more than about 7 points in the pop vote then he more than likely has the numbers to carry Florida, which was the tipping point state in 2016. If it's a five-point lead then it's close and less than that it comes down to incredibly small margins like it did in 2016.

The article discusses a theory of elections I agree with: there are no swing voters, the game is all about turnout. Each election is won by the coalition that turns up. In 2016, too many Democrats stayed home or voted for third candidates or were lured by Trump. In 2020, there is a palpable wave building and I feel the Democratic coalition will turn up. Biden has weaknesses, but I think the difference with 2016 is that Democrats who stayed home did not envision a Hillary Clinton loss or imagined that they were comfortable with either a Trump or Clinton win and many created a false equivalence that in retrospect they would not have. In 2020, Democrats turn up. The article in question: https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/02/06/rachel-bitecofer-profile-election-forecasting-new-theory-108944."

I still believe the combo of party loyalty and demographics clearly favor a generic Democratic candidate in the popular vote, but who's running, how they campaign, and how Trump (and co.?) campaign will affect this number. So I'm going to revise it down to 2:1 odds in favor of the Dem. I'm also slightly revising my estimate of the result in the Electoral College to catch up with my forecast on that specific question, where I have it 0.55/0.45 in favor of the GOP based on overall uncertainty tipped slightly toward Trump for a few reasons, including possible voter suppression and influence ops in key states."

Possibly a 6th instance occurred if one counts the 1960 election and its Alabama discrepancies. That translates to about 8-12%. In contemporary, post World War II history, there have been 18 elections since 1948.

Michigan is already in and Pennsylvania Democrats will come out to vote in 2020 and a Democratic candidate-whoever that may be- will win.
