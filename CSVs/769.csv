Looking at the actual plot, it is fairly easy to see that the hospitalizations are beginning to level out. The question now is whether the descent will continue at its current rate, speed up, slow down, or reverse. A complete reverse is unlikely in just a few weeks, as is an increase given current behaviors. Most likely, on average, the rate will continue to decrease in the next few weeks, which makes the final bucket the most likely.

Averaging three different approaches: 1) With an average number like yesterdays decrease (52, which was a little lower than the average of the week before) we would be at 2500 by 29 September with a linear approach. (80:20) 2) If we view it as asymtotic towards somewhere below 2500, it would take a little longer, which could indeed lead to bin 5. (60:40) 3) If we look at the ""big picture"", it´s as discussed before: number of new infections is going down significantly, leading to less new hospitalizations. With the average person leaving hospital after 2-3 weeks it would be much faster, perhaps in a week already. On the other hand we need to consider the worst-case-possibility of numbers increasing again (20% for that), so it´s 80:20 for this approach)."

With the number of tests quite stable that looks like a good sign to me. There should be significantly less new patients going to hospital and many of those still there leaving it in the near future (the average time in hospital in Germany was 2 weeks in July). Very much looks like it´s going to be bin 4, but with Covid-19 you never know. @ManuPV : In that case I agree with the time frame you mentioned. Bin 5 can´t be ignored too. Perhaps there will be another wave or it´s asysmptotically (slowly) approaching a number above 2500.

The graph of hospitalizations shows a slight flattening more recently in the trend. Given the trend doesn’t continue, I think the number of hospitalizations may continue to be above 2500 for quite a while; even before cases spiked in Texas, hospitalizations averaged around 1700 for several months. This number serves as a level of ‘irreducible’ hospitalizations that are simply too hard/expensive to control. 2500 is not much higher than this ‘irreducible’ level, again increasing the size of that right tail. California has had a similar (https://update.covid19.ca.gov/) growth and decline, and seems to be getting close to the ‘irreducible’ level with no sign of slowing down."

Counting backwards 22 days from the 22 July we get to 30 June when there were 6533 patients (1 July: 6904 patients). The downward trend seem to be following the upward pretty closely, but maybe a bit flatter. 15 June was the last day when the number of patients were below 2500 with 2326 (2518 the next day). From 15 June to 22 July it is 37 days. 37 days from 22 July is 28 August. These trends point to a resolution around the turn of the month and I'm adjusting accordingly.

If this trend holds, it would take 26 days to pass 2,500 hospitalizations per day, which puts us at September 6th. However, consistent linear trends are rare in epidemiology, both on the way up and on the way down. More likely, the slope will decrease in magnitude in the coming weeks (even if a second wave does not begin). This drop in magnitude will likely push the 2,500 benchmark back by several days, putting an expected date closer to the September 14th range. A lot could happen between now and then, but at least at the moment, I'd say there is a good chance we won't see less than 2500 hospitalizations in a single day in Texas until mid- to late-September."

As long as the police refuse to enforce governor's mask mandate [2a] this is not going to change. I assume this will change when there are more there are more covid-19 patience than ICU beds and daily covid-19 deaths soar as a result above 1300 per day. When mask wearing, keeping physical distance [2b], hand washing, air disinfection with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation [2c], etc is taken seriously it will take another 40 days for the daily hospitalization cases to drop below the threshold of 2500. [3] When assuming a similar dynamic as in New York it will take another 3 weeks to reach the level of 1300 covid deaths per day. Taking it all together it will take at least 2 months before the number of COVID-19 Hospitalizations in the state of Texas for a single day next be 2500 or lower."

While the hospitalization data from Texas is now disrupted, based on new cases looking to have peaked July 15/16, we should be hitting peak hospitalization around now (July 26). While some states, like New York, showed very sharp falls in hospitalizations from peak to ~25% of peak (40 days h/t @jainsa), others like Massachusetts took close to 60 days. Texas is doing far less than NY to control its outbreak, so I think it is more likely that its fall in cases will be more gradual than NY or other places in the NE and it may even plateau at a relatively high level. The October 4 date could be very close to the line, but I think we are more likely to hit 2,500 after this date than before it."

The other large hospitalization areas that recovered, New York and Illinois, returned to a similar level from a month out after another month from the peak. Texas is worse because of the velocity and the lower adherence to measures, but we know more so prevention and treatment are more effective.

If 14 July was the peak it was at 10569 hospitalizations so roughly four times 2500. Coming week should make it clear if 14 July was a peak or not, I give it a probability of around 80% that it was. After New York peaked in their number of hospitalizations on 12 April with 18825 it took until 22 May, or 41 days, to get down to 1/4 of the peak number with 4642 hospitalizations. [1] 41 days from 14 July is 23 August. The ICU numbers seem to follow the same trajectory in New York with a delay of a day or two. If the same logic can be applied to Sweden we see that between the peak to when the number of patients in ICU was down to 1/4 there were 68 days.[2] 68 days from 14 July is 19 September. The pandemic seem to have had a more explosive development in New York than it has had in Texas. In New York there are 17 days from when you first hit 1/3 of the eventual peak to when you hit the peak[1], in Texas it was 24 days (assuming a peak was reached 14 July). This indicates a flatter curve which will make it take a longer time for Texas to get the numbers down. Summary and conclusion: I believe a peak has been reached in Texas the 14 of July and that it will take around 41-68 days (23 August-19 September), likely much closer to 68, to get to 2500 patients or below."

After 34 days of lock down, they managed to get back to about 2500 cases on May 4, which is 34 days. In Texas the Governor doesn't want to shut down and has stated that it will take 2 to 3 weeks to see the effect of his mask mandate and the people of TX are more resistant to government intrusions. By August 5, it is likely their numbers will still be on the rise or at an unsustainable plateau. Expecting he may be forced to shut down, and if he did so to take effect August 7, it would take another 2-3 weeks to see improvements. By August 5, their numbers could be topping 20-30,000 per day, making it harder to drop as quickly as NY. We could expect to see a drop by August 28, but by based on patterns with NY, it took 30 days to get back to their numbers from the shutdown date (around 5800). If TX is at around 25,000 at the start of a shutdown, and because so many more people will be carrying, it may take at least 45 day days to get back to their 20-25,000 a day number. That would put them at a around September, and if they halved their numbers every week, it would be past October 4 before they reach 2500."
