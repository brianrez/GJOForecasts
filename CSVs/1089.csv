So the list for 29 Sep will cover the release week for ""The Testaments"". I would also assume that the list for 6 Oct will be online on 30 Sep (before the question end date). I don't know whether I am stating the obvious for everyone else forecasting this question, but the question boils down to whether the book will be a #1 bestsellers in either of its first two weeks on the market. Based on press about good sales in the first few days, increasing probability. Leaving a slight hedge for Stephen King snatching the top spot. https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/81168-testaments-off-to-recordbreaing-start.html https://www.citynews1130.com/2019/09/12/sales-for-handmaids-tale-sequel-top-125000-copies/amp/"
