""some EU governments are reported as wanting to give former Spanish prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the main EU envoy for Venezuela, another chance to broker a dialogue between the Venezuelan government and the opposition."" (http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-992f-Latin-America-rejects-threats-to-Venezuela). Talks today have made 'advances' but no deal (https://uk.news.yahoo.com/advances-no-deal-venezuela-rivals-talk-005656394.html) ... and Trump weighed in last week. All this suggests there is a lot of talking going on and imposing a travel ban or seizure of assets would simply raise the stakes and make those talks more unpredictable. The consensus here is that this is unlikely so I'm opting the same. One to keep an eye on in coming weeks if talks fail."
