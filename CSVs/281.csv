Q2 I believe struggled due to Shanghai closures, but there's a risk that COVID issues in China continue, plus risk of economic downturn in the US and continued supply chain issues. So overall I'm narrowing quite a bit. Though Berlin and Texas could increase these numbers somewhat going forward, however overall I believe these are still in the ramp up phase so probably won't do numbers comparable to other factories this year."

Obviously growth rates are there and if Shanghai and Berlin come under steam the production will be markably up. Berlin was mentioned to have 1000 rolling and this will be increased. Assume they achieve an average of 2500 per week it gives an additional of 50-100 for the year so with run rates of 290 in q4 and q1 that gives 340, so questioning if the rest from Shanghai will do. They say in the Q2 report that Shanghai was closed for most of Q2 but ended with a record month. The total q2 production vs q1 is -50k, so that then would imply that Shanghai could run(s) at 150k per quarter which is 100k more than now. Therefore I get to 242 (q2 base) +90 (Shanghai delta) +40 (Berlin) = 372 per quarter *2 = 744 +550 (production so far) = 1294k, which would just be bin 3."

According to the article linked below both factories are supposed to have 500k annual capacity. I doubt they'll hit that their first year as they ramp up, but maybe another 500k between them. I don't know if I can add that directly to the 1.3 million, because I'm not sure if that 10-15% quarterly growth is due to new capacity opening up or if it's due to increased plant efficiencies or what.
