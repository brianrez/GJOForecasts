88452,2021-03-08T13:54:59Z,4,[80.0],[-20.0],"Interesting, how words complicate this matter: DW reported on 06 March 2021, that CGTN received ""permission"" by the French CSA (with the consequence of being received e.g. in the German Vodafone network), in line with the ""1989 transfrontier television agreement"". However, DW delivers the same interpretation that ""CGTN's managers approached the Conseil Supérieur de l'Audiovisuel (CSA) for confirmation that this service was now under French jurisdiction under European law,"" the CSA said in a statement published on its website."" and further: ""a distribution license in one European country is valid across the continent, German media authorities had to notify television networks, such as Vodafone, that the CGTN channel no longer had permission to broadcast."""

If CGTN did not have to seek a license to France, France will never grant a license. So from 100% of CGTN can be broadcast in France, i should answer 0% from getting a formal approval from France. https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_des_cha%C3%AEnes_de_t%C3%A9l%C3%A9vision_en_France https://www.csa.fr/Informer/Espace-presse/Communiques-de-presse/La-chaine-CGTN-releve-pour-sa-diffusion-en-Europe-de-la-competence-de-la-France https://francais.cgtn.com/channel"

93350,2021-02-28T06:57:28Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],"France has no law that prohibits state-controlled broadcasters from airing within the country. The French media watchdog, Conseil supérieur de l’audiovisuel (CSA), has stated that further analysis is required for a decision and that id would depend on technical issues rather political ones. After rejection by OFCOM in the UK of the CGTN broadcast licence, China would benefit from a positive judgement form the CSA as according to the Council of Europe Treaty, if any one member allows it broadcast, then it broadcast to all members. (The Council of Europe has 47 members that include France, UK and China). Brexit does not affect this. Therefore, CGTN could overcome the OFCOM rejection as being an arm of the Chinese Communist Party lacking editorial independence (that contravenes UK Law), but local operators would have to agree to carry the broadcaster. (Vodaphone in Germany has dropped CGTN from its cable network.) No matter the outcome, CGTN is still able to stream its content online and keep its European HQ."
