The country will prioritise the development of a floating nuclear power platform in order to support its offshore oil and gas activities, and its presence in the Paracel and Spratly Islands, he told state media. Wang’s comments came after Beijing said in a white paper last year that it was developing floating nuclear power plants to facilitate the exploration of maritime resources. China Securities Journal reported last year that China could build up to 20 floating nuclear plants in the region to “speed up the commercial development” of the South China Sea."""

Reuters, August 5, 'ASEAN communique stalls amid disagreement on South China Sea stance': http://www.reuters.com/article/us-asean-philippines-idUSKBN1AL05R?il=0 Clips from Reuters article: ""ASEAN's problem in agreeing the wording highlight China's growing influence at a time of uncertainty whether the new U.S. administration will prioritise relations with ASEAN, and try to check Beijing's controversial maritime activities. Diplomats from three ASEAN countries said the delay was because Vietnam, which is among four members with competing sovereignty claims with China, wanted the text to mention the need to avoid land reclamation and militarisation. A working draft of the communique seen on Thursday was a watered-down version of one issued last year and drops references to both."""

Scarborough Shoal is officially part of the People's Republic of China and if the Chinese decided to renovate and add a runway and a small harbor, they would increase military power in the region. The US, Philippines and China are continuously positioning for naval strength in the South China Sea. President Xi said he would go to war over the island. I believe that statement prevents the need for adding military installations by the Chinese on Scarborough Shoal. Also, the fishing is good."

In farther seas, it will increasingly expect the US to back off and respect its right to defend the oceanic arteries that pump economic life into the country. And while Beijing’s diplomats preach harmony, there is an undercurrent of nationalism running through its officialdom — and a desire to be recognized as a fearsome global power. One prominent weapons expert who regularly writes for state-owned newspapers — Shen Dingli, a professor at Shanghai’s Fudan University — described the military thusly: “China can now destroy the United States repeatedly. Ten times over.” This was a message, conveyed through PRI in February, to the Trump-era US State Department following repeated US threats to blockade island bases in the South China Sea. Chinese nuclear warheads, Shen says, are “300 times as powerful as the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs. Maybe [US Secretary of State] Rex Tillerson doesn’t know this. So we’ll let him know it.”"

The monitoring stations, along with docks and other infrastructure, form part of island restoration and erosion prevention efforts planned for 2017, Mr Xiao told the state-owned Hainan Daily. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/south-china-sea-dispute-beijing-philippines-scarborough-shoal-nine-dash-line-manila-a7637216.html ________________________ COMMENTS: Xi Jinping may seize this opportunity to fool both the US and The Philippines considering the foreign policy expertise of both, Trump and Duterte, Although this question puzzles me. What exactly ""land reclamation activity"" means? The above looks a lot like ""activity"" to me, are there activities that are more ""reclamation"" than others?"

Clearly China has taken de facto control of the Scarborough Shoals, it is controlling which nations and boats can fish there and which vessels can enter the area. My assumption is that it is holding fire for now to see what the US will do about it. It is thought possible that Trump will trade control of the Shoals in return for China dealing with the treats of North Korea, but from a medium/long term point of view it may not be wise to allow China to take any more de facto control of areas within the ""nine dotted line"". So at some point I believe the US will need to act, at which point there could be a clash. But with foreign affairs issues in Syria, with Russia, with Iran and with North Korea, my guess is that Trump and China might prefer to avoid raising tensions by starting work on the Shoal this year. The problem for the US is that the longer it leaves China in place policing the fishery the more difficult to claim that China has no right to do it."

He called his book Mare Clausum, or “closed seas,” in open rebuke of Grotius. This theory held that a sovereign power could extend its territory to the oceans, and attacked the idea of free seas as metaphysical nonsense. Sovereignty extended to wherever a nation chose to park its ships or exert power, regardless of legal theories. So the British set about to upend the vexatious Dutch trade dominance and began building a powerful navy. The British then went about passing a series of mercantilist “Navigation Acts” to restrict trade, and shut off chunks of the ocean to rivals."""

China is also trying to lend a greater civilian touch to the controversial militarized islands it has built atop reefs in the more distant Spratly archipelago, where Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei, and the Philippines also claim territory. For example last year it added a farm to Fiery Cross Reef, complete with hundreds of livestock, including pigs, chicken, and geese.

Fu Ying, the spokesperson for the Chinese National People’s Congress, gave few details beyond noting the overall 7 percent expansion. Fu emphasized that China would still seek the peaceful resolution of all international and regional disputes. “At the same time, we need the ability to safeguard our sovereignty, and our rights and interests,”Fu said. “In particular, we need to guard against outside forces intervening in these disputes.” Asked about the South China Sea, where a recently arrived U.S. carrier group is currently undertaking regular patrols, Fu said “As to how the situation develops in the future, that depends on U.S. intentions,” Fu said. “American actions in the South China Sea have a definite significance as an indicator of how the wind is blowing.”"

According to a draft that was published to solicit public opinion, foreign ships that violate Chinese laws would be expelled, state-run media reported. The proposed changes are in line with international maritime law, Beijing media said, but they could also set China up for conflict with Washington, which insists on freedom of navigation. The draft doesn’t mention the South China Sea specifically, but China claims the area almost in its entirety. Late last year, China seized an underwater glider that was launched by the USS Bowditch in international waters off the Philippines and returned it after the U.S. protested. “Beijing is seeking to improve its management of maritime security by adding new operational details into law, especially details related to growing threats from foreign close-in surveillance,” Lin Yongxin, a senior researcher from the government-affiliated National Institute on South China Sea Studies, told the South China Morning Post."""

The location of the Shoal and Bank in question slightly lowers the prediction as being provocatively close to the Philippines, particularly Scarborough. Both are uninhibited features which contradict claims under unbinding south china seas treaty touted by China. Duetertes turn towards China. Recent UN tribunal ruling against China. US red line pronouncements. China's leaked claims of potential construction while US distracted with election. I would add that sevedb's analyses is extremely helpful but it really only addresses Scarborough, which is much more controversial. The Macclesfield Bank is also included in the question, is much less controversial than Scarborough, and is only contested by Taiwan. However, Macclesfield Bank is not an atoll, it is purely an underwater feature making it a less likely candidate for reclamation. It seems to me that since China has disavowed the UN tribunal ruling that they will likely select a less controversial feature for reclamation but will go forward as a sign of strength somewhere in the South China Sea. There were approximately 29 separate features, islets, atolls, rock outcroppings, banks, addressed in the UN tribunal decision. Also, since the question only asks if China will begin reclamation on either, not complete, it is possible that China will begin (whatever that means) the process in advance of any regional negotiations on ownership of the disputed territories as a negotiating ploy."

On the other hand, “Duterte has adopted a noticeably anti-American tone, while sounding more accommodating towards China.” “This suggests that the Philippines’ presence in an informal US-led bloc of Asian nations aimed at counter-balancing China’s rise is no longer assured,” according to BMI Research. The report noted that because of its strategic location between global trade routes connecting the Pacific Ocean and the West Philippine Sea, the Philippines had gained geopolitical importance. “The US first recognised the Philippines’ strategic significance more than a century ago, when it seized the territory from Spain in the Spanish-American War of 1898,” it said."""
