For no confirmation to occur you would need for (a) Trump to not nominate anyone (he has already said he will do so quickly), (b) the Senate to refuse to vote (McConnell has already said they will vote), or (c) the Senate to deny a nominee. Thanks to a 2017 change, the Senate needs just 50 votes (not 60) to confirm a judge, which means Rep support is more than enough. Initially, I believed that pressure on key Senators who are up for re-election had a small chance at stopping a confirmation. I now realize this is wrong for several reasons. First, most of those seeking re-election have tied themselves to Trump in one way or another. It is also common knowledge that the GOPs base values SCOTUS appointees above almost any other issue. It is difficult to see how enough Republicans could be pressured in the correct way to reject or delay a vote in order to appeal to their base. However, and this is what I am now realizing and others have commented on as well, it doesn't actually matter whether we pressure Republican politicians during the election. Whether they are voted out or kept in, they will still have basically 2 months to ram a nominee through before the next cycle. The only reason I've left 9% on the No is that they technically have until January 20th to push through any lame duck policies if they need to, so it may come through after the 1st. Personally, however, I think it will come by late October, there will be a public outcry of hypocrisy and corruption, no one will do anything of substance, and we will live with the ramifications for decades to come."

Liberal Americans hoped she would live long enough to deny Donald Trump the chance to entrench a 6-3 conservative majority on the court. Following her death on September 18th, precedent would dictate choosing a successor only after the presidential election in November. But in the final strait of the campaign, politics is paramount. Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader of the Senate, promptly announced the vote would be held. With a long list of potential picks, there should be little delay in settling on a name. One favourite is Amy Coney Barrett, a judge on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. A vote could take place before the November election. Mr Trump’s third Supreme Court appointee may yet be in a position to swing the outcome of the election if, as seems likely, the results in key states are contested in the courts.“"

For the 55 that have retired, the average age of retirement is 73.6 years. Of those on the court now, only two are older than this age (though they are in their 80s), RBG and Breyer. So I'd bump my prediction up around 5 points. With the health issues surrounding RBG, I'd give it another 5 points that a seat opens up, giving a 69% chance no seat becomes vacant before January 1st. Now, the average time between a nomination and confirmation in recent history is 67 days, or a little over 2 months, though in the current political climate it is possible the Senate will attempt to ram through a decision in less time given that McConnell has staked his career on the courts. Given that the Republicans will still be in control of the Senate on January 1st (regardless of the election) I'd give it 70/30 odds that a vacant seat is not filled by then."

So maybe call it a 10% chance of a death in office or severe illness that takes things out of the justices control. Resignation otherwise seems relatively unlikely - historically you have seen a new justice every couple of years, but there have already been 2 under Donald Trump and it seems very unlikely that the Democrat appointed justices would resign at this point in Trump's presidency rather than holding out hope for a Democrat victory in November. Remaining republican appointed justices would all seem likely to feel they could serve out even an 8-year term if Trump lost, with the possible exception of Clarence Thomas. Clarence Thomas may feel some pressure to resign if Trump is flagging in the polls, but arguably that pressure was as high in 2019 and he did not act. Possibility for some shenanigans post election result if either Trump wins and RBG just decides she cannot go another 4 years or Trump loses and Clarence Thomas decides to try to allow the lame duck session to replace him. You could also have scandals, impeachment of a justice, etc. but those are historically relatively unprecedented. Let's call it 10% chance of death, 2% chance during the remaining period, 2% in the lame duck session. Sure the majority of Republicans will try to confirm, but a few defections would be problematic and timing may be an issue. Feels like up until the Summer, pressure to pass from the party would be very high, so maybe 75%, as things get closer that should fall, but probably not below 50%"

Ginsburg is reported cancer-free, but she underwent radiotherapy and research has found that this reduces expected lifespan of patients by up to 30%. That pushes up the likelihood of her dying in 2020, sadly. The timing of any death is crucial for the replacement issue; it takes time to confirm a new justice, but there would be political pressure to accelerate the process through the senate to ensure a conservative appointment. McConnell has shown no compunction at all about using the process for his political ends, so even a nomination after a November presidential loss could be jammed through, so I think it's unlikely that we would see a vacancy carried over from 2020 into a Biden / Sanders presidency."

Her motivation to stay on regardless of health condition due to the consequence of another Trump nomination makes her probability equal to her probability of death. This leaves only the probability of a motivation to resign by one of the conservative justices and only Clarence Thomas would be in a position to do that. His wife makes close to a million dollars per year as a lobbyist which she is active in. If he leaves his seat, her influence and value go down.

However, I think there is a very low likelihood of her voluntarily stepping down; she has publicly stated that she hopes to remain on the bench until age 90. She has had a series of health issues recently, but each time she has had them successfully dealt with and worked remotely while seeking treatment. The liberal bloc of the Supreme Court would not want to let another vacancy open while President Trump is in office. I think it is very unlikely that another seat is both vacated and confirmed this year, but I leave a 20% change that a vacancy opens up due to Ruth Bader Ginsberg's age and health. Justice Breyer is also in his 80s, and there is always the possibility that an unforeseen health issue arises for these relatively elderly justices."

Considering a democratic win in the presidential election, the retirement of a democratic judge would have a democratic judge as a consequence all be it with a confirmation after 1 January 2021. I think there is a 19% chance of retirement of one of the democratic judges around December (for the second bucket, yes but no) Using life expectancy as the next argument, I think there is a 61% (81% no retirement * 75% chance of all living) that the SC bench will not change and a 15% chance that a new judge will be confirmed by the senate before 1/1 (3/4 chance of 20% chance of a non-retired judge passing in the coming year).
