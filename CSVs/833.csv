Improvements in autonomous driving that expand the scope of situations where drivers don't actively pilot are marginal gains in autonomy. But the jump from a mixed piloted/autonomous system to fully autonomous is pretty big. However, I see a couple of pathways for at least one manufacturer to sell a self-driving vehicle w/o a steering wheel: 1) a small or niche automaker manufactures a vehicle that can be operated fully autonomously w/o a steering wheel in limited situations but nonetheless fits the definition here, and, 2) an automaker manufactures a vehicle that is piloted but has a self-driving mode and uses a joystick-like control. I'm not sure how to think about the likelihood of one vs. more than one selling such a vehicle."

The technology is fairly secure (based on feedback from a friend at the Oxford Robotics Institute), but the sale needs to be legalised. The question specifically states the lack of a steering wheel which makes this easier. No matter how much you train a program, it can still meet unknown situations. In the case of an AV, it would then be very useful information to understand how a human might tackle that problem (from the manufacturer's perspective). Further, autonomous vehicles may be legally required to have a back up system to allow for driver control, similar to how must brake systems require a physical back up to a computerised system (governmental perspective). I have put the probability of 0 at 90% because there may be countries which make technology pushes which require flagship events/publicity. Showing a few steering wheel-less cars could form part of that. Should that be legalised, I expect the technology is safe enough that more than one manufacturer will sell a vehicle to some wealthy customers, with those customers mostly making the purchase for the novelty factor.
