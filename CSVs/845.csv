I would not have expected an early bankruptcy and the very slow recovery of airlines leaves some doubt in my mind if they will all make it through. That said I do not think it is very likely that any of the major airlines will declare bankruptcy in the next month."

If any of these carriers were going to file for bankruptcy in the considered period it was far more likely to have occurred in the May – July period as COVID was at it is “peak” travel season in the United States.2 While this was undoubtedly a gut punch to the airline industry if they were able to weather this storm it is likely that with the holiday travel season fast approaching and COVID travel restrictions easing in many areas of the nation, airlines will continue to see a progressive increase in business going forward."

Initially, the virus prevented commercial air travel, but has since resumed with proper mitigation techniques and penalties for those passengers and airlines that are not following the proper protocols. Historic data suggests that none of the Group III air carriers were in danger of bankruptcy before COVID made an impact. Similar to the automobile industry bailouts in 2008, massive government bailouts allocated resources to saving airlines effected by COVID (CNBC, 2020). Lastly, major airline United Airlines already accepted large amounts of debt to prevent filing for bankruptcy, with hopes of an increased revenue stream as restrictions are lifted (Aviation Pros, 2020). With massive government support and allocated funding, my prediction is as follows: -5% Yes https://www.aviationpros.com/home/news/10406114/united-airlines-signs-off-on-3-billion-in-bankruptcy-exit-financing https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/08/over-40-airlines-have-failed-in-2020-so-far-and-more-are-set-to-come.html https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-airlines-that-failed-bankrupt-covid19-pandemic-2020-3"

The data has been extracted for each week this year, starting on Monday 6th January. Data for January through to July is the cumulative data for the weeks starting in each of those months, while August flights are displayed as the weekly variance with the same week in 2019. According to Madhu Unnikrishnan of Skift, “Travel recovery may be starting, but it may not be enough to save thousands of U.S. airline jobs. Unless Congress acts to extend payroll protections, mass layoffs could start on October 1. Bankruptcy isn’t likely this time around, as airlines still have access to capital, as a flurry of recent stock, bond, and asset sale transactions clearly show. No U.S. airline is anywhere close to running low on cash”."

Once again, Covid-19 is a major contributing factor to the survival of group III carriers. Travel has taken a dramatic hit because of the pandemic, “on Wednesday, Transportation Security Administration officers screened just shy of 95,000 people at airport checkpoints, a dramatic drop from the 2.3 million who passed through on the equivalent day in 2019” (Wallace, 2020). Airlines are losing money at a rapid rate and are having very little attendance, “even as Delta and the other major airlines in the United States dramatically slash schedules, they are averaging an anemic 23 passengers on each domestic flight and losing $350 million to $400 million a day as expenses like payroll, rent and aircraft maintenance far exceed the money they are brining in” (Chokshi, 2020). Even though airlines are losing money at a consistent rate, group III carries have survived. Airlines have been able to survive by taking on debt, “$67 billion of the new debt is composed f government loans ($50 billion), deferred taxes ($5 billion) and loan guarantees ($12 billion)” (Garcia, 2020). Another way airlines have been able to survive is through furloughs, “United Airlines and American Airlines have sent furlough notices to a total of more than 32,000 employees, saying they can’t afford to have them on payroll after Thursday-the expiration date for the federal CARES Act Payroll Support Program” (NPR,2020). Like all industries, air travel has been greatly affected. However, not every airline will furlough their employees, “‘Southwest has no current plans for furloughs,’ a company representative tells NPR, citing cost-cutting and voluntary agreements with workers. Delta is in a similar position” (NPR, 2020). The airline industry is grim. However, it is my belief that group III U.S. carriers will do everything in their power to avoid declaring bankruptcy. While Virgin has already declared bankruptcy, I do not believe anyone else will. Between government loans, restructuring, and pay cuts, airlines will be able to survive until the end of November, 2020. Wallace, G (2020, April 09).

To be classified as a Group III air carrier, companies must have operating revenue boundaries of over $1 billion (Chadwick, 2019). Airlines are currently transitioning to cater to leisure travelers as business travel largely halted in midst of the pandemic and damaged economy with an observed 58% decrease in travel observed in April 2020 compared to 2019 (Josephs, 2020; Nguyen & Animashaun, 2020). The air industry received a $25 billion bailout in mid-April to keep them afloat through September (Rappeport & Chokshi, 2020). However, with no second bailout currently reached, airlines have begun to shrink through employee layoffs and groundings of aircraft to remain afloat (Egan, 2020). With talks about a second economic relief bill at a standstill, the airlines are expected to continue to shrink up to 50% and continue to reduce prices and erroneous fees to entice travelers to purchase tickets (Egan, 2020; Josephs, 2020). According to Oscar Munoz former CEO of United Airlines, while the situation is dire and numerous airlines have filed for bankruptcy in the previous two decades following 9/11 and the recession, with layoffs and fleet reductions major carriers likely to survive through the year (Egan, 2020). While additional bailouts may not be reached prior to or even immediately after the election on 3 November, layoffs, fleet reductions, minor increases in leisure travel observed due to incentives, and roughly one and a half months left, I estimate there is a 10% probability that a Group III US air carrier will declare bankruptcy by 30 November. https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/28/coronavirus-air-travel-focus-on-leisure-travelers.html"

Many airlines will need government bailouts within weeks or face bankruptcy and with all the political wrangling and an election in early Nov I do not see any bailout making it to the airlines before 2021. In general air travel in the U.S. is down more than 90% year over year. However, there is some recovery in sight and Boeing expects demand to be back to roughly 50% of previous levels by year-end. That assumes the economy reopens and things start to get back to normal.

Seems like the way to check is calculate your Expected Brier Score, meaning, what your Brier Score would be on average for a question assuming you are handicapping it perfectly. For instance, say you think Event A has a uniform chance of happening over the course of 12 months of 80%. You could wager 80% at the start, reducing as time expires at an average rate of 20% (or 25% of your wager) per quarter. But my guess is a linearly sloped reduction isn't optimal for this reason: if Event A happens, it could happen at any time. OTOH, if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen at the end of 12 months every time, meaning the average of all your forecasts are counted when the event doesn't happen, whereas when it does happen only your forecasts to-date are scored. So you want forecasts-to-date as high as possible when the event occurs and as low as possible when not. Morever, this gives the *early* forecasts much more weight than *late* forecasts when the event does occur because the early forecasts exist in more universes than the late forecasts, so to speak."

Even in regular times, before the COVID crisis, some large air transport companies were only an oil crisis or a labor dispute away from filing. And even though the government may bail out most of the major players, it is unlikely to support the weaker-structured companies.

It is highly likely that the necessary capacity adjustments will not take place within every airline, but finally and more easily will happen by some of them going bust. The individual financing structure, major shareholders and exact conditions of leasing contracts and plane orders will determine at what time large lump sums and corporate actions will come due, and which of the carriers will have to file first. This, in turn, will leave some more headroom for the rest of the mob to survive. Even with a large portion of optimism and options like floating convertible bonds (e.g. CoCos), finding strategic investors, mergers etc etc, a bankruptcy seems inevitable. Furthermore, filing for bankruptcy has the charming effect of lowering (or getting rid of, altogether) the burden of costly and long standing pension schemes."

Masks and distancing help but there appears to be a breakdown in that. I will start with a cautious more likely than not.
