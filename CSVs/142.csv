YouTube tends to recommend certain videos to certain people, so watchers could’ve intentionally, however, probably not everyone who “watched” the trailer viewed the entire thing. Additionally, we’re not sure if people viewed the video twice so there could be a lot of viewers that viewed it more than once. I also wanted to come to the realization that although $9.57 is the average it doesn’t mean that every person who viewed it that weekend paid the price the average says they would pay. Children or people under the age of 18 have to be counted. However, these are all minor things, and that is why I decided to narrow the percentage only by 5% and I’m still confident that it’ll reach the $40 million mark."

Top Gun was the most famous movie of its time, in the genre of course, and reboots and late sequels have been highly sought after in past years. The projected figures of the movie have been seen as anything from $95 million to $130 million, but nowhere near $45 million. Covid would have been a factor, however Spider-man: No Way Home, made $260 million proving that the pandemic is a much smaller factor now than it has been in past years. The ad budget for the movie is over $140 million and they have spent $150 million on production of the movie. On top of that, every scene in a jet was shot in the cockpit of an actual F/A-18 Super Hornet, something that has never been done. Tom Cruise is a huge name in Hollywood and he is complimented by actors such as Jon Hamm, Val Kilmer, Miles Teller, Ed Harris, and Glen Powell. With an all star cast, a massive budget on both production and advertising, an abundance of hype and nostalgia, and a great potential for a plot, Top Gun Maverick is destined for much more than $45 million."

The 2nd highest opening was Spider-Man: No Way Home which occurred during peak omicron scare, so the pandemic is not an obstacle. Top Gun is also a famous film with an built-in fanbase. Considering (1) the trailer was released in 2020 and anticipation has been building for over two year and (2) Cruise's apparent ability to keep any current-day politics out of his films, thus avoiding any audience division (compare receipts for Eternals or Black Widow with No Way Home for the difference politics can make) then barring another lockdown (unlikely, we're entering summer), I can't see this not happening."
