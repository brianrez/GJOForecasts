ND is a red state, low-info FNC viewing small govt country peeps and doubt Heitkamp can campaign as well as McCaskell to pull the rabbit out of the hat. Or appeal to the base-instincts of MAGAkins like Cramer probably is. Scare them about Honduran immigrants despite ND being so far from Mexico and harder to get to (and earn income) than say east coast states."

Some of the votes Heitkamp will have to make before the election will gave Cramer the opportunity to mark her as out of mainstream of average North Dakota voters. I believe there will be above average turnouts this Fall around the country and that will result in Democrat and Republican candidates winning in a traditional way and reduce chances for upsets. If so North Dakota will send the Republican to the Senate.
