Fast National Ratings are typically reported on the Monday following Sunday programming. This season's Fast National viewership numbers for Sunday Night Football are as follows: 10 September 2017: 21.559 million viewers (The Futon Critic) 17 September 2017: 18.460 million viewers (The Futon Critic) 24 September 2017: 14.537 million viewers (The Futon Critic) 1 October 2017: 14.009 million viewers (The Futon Critic) 8 October 2017: 14.853 million viewers (The Futon Critic) 15 October 2017: 14.423 million viewers (The Futon Critic) 22 October 2017: 16.741 million viewers (The Futon Critic) 29 October 2017: 12.666 million viewers The Futon Critic) NOTE: This is an experimental short-term question intended to serve as 'forecasting fodder.' The idea is to give forecasters a way to get scored quickly on questions that demand difficult, multifaceted analysis. Sunday Night Football viewership in any given week may be influenced by long-term trends (e.g. a move to streaming services), or circumstances specific to game day (who is playing, what competing programming will air), among other factors.

Tossing out the large opening week audience SNF is averaging just over 15 million viewers -- but trending below that in recent weeks. Not necessarily a 'marquee' game matchup for this Sunday. Oakland has lost 5 of its last 6 games. TV markets involved may be somewhat larger than last week's Pitt.-Detroit, but not markedly. (SF-Oak., # 6 -- but probably divided. Miami, #16 market, game is televised there.) Game is on at 5:20 PT in Oakland...can't say if positive or negative for viewership there. (Technically outside of 'prime time'..) End of DST means hours of darkness (outside) before game-time esp. in the eastern US. Could somewhat boost TV viewership."

Again, not necessarily a marquee match-up. However, there are some things that go in favor of a higher viewership this week. First, Oakland has a pretty loyal fan base (Pittsburgh last week also did, but had less viewership for other reasons in my opinion), so that should help. Second, there's no major programming to compete with. There's some NBA and NHL games, which will probably chip away at some viewership, but nothing on the basic cable channels which would draw viewership away. Third, last year's SNF match-up was OAK vs. KC, which garnered just over 15.3M viewers. Granted, that was a divisional match-up with playoff implications, so that likely bumped viewership higher. Finally, with the exception of some notable outliers, viewership has averaged around the 15M mark."
