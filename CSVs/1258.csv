Will the yield curve for 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasuries invert before 2019?,2018-11-02T03:59:37Z,2019-01-01T07:59:37Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']","['Finance', 'Economic Indicators']",784,654,417,237,"For the past several years, the spread between yields on 2-year Treasuries and 10-year Treasuries has been closing (Investopedia). When interest rates on longer term debt drop below rates on shorter term debt, the yield curve is said to invert, which historically has been a bad omen for economic growth (CNBC). This question will resolve as ""yes"" if the Daily Treasury Yield Curve Rate provided by the U.S. Department of the Treasury shows the value in the ""2 Yr"" column exceeds that in the ""10 Yr"" column on any one day (The U.S. Department of the Treasury).

The CME Fedwatch website predicts Fed rate movements based on the futures market. Right, now it places a 74% probability that the Fed will raise rates at its December 18-19 meeting by 25 bps (https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html). Since this probability is well known and considered by bond investors, I’ll say that the remaining 24% uncertainty is not already baked into the current 2 year rate and that there should only be a 6.5 basis point (25 bps increase x 26% of uncertainty) increase in the 2 year rate. If that happens, the 2 year adjusts accordingly, and the 10 year rate remains unchanged, the spread reduced to 6.5 bps. At this point, I’ll assume a base rate of 0% probability of inversion. Theoretically, the yield curve should never invert because longer term investors demand a term premium. So, as the 2 year rate increases, the 10 year should increase by and unknown amount. Though, the term premium, as determined by the current spread is very small. In addition, an inversion is a very rare occurrence (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y). My probability remains 0% at this point. Current economic reports also lead bond investors to draw conclusions about rates in the future which can have a positive or negative effect on longer term yields. I don’t claim to have any more incite about upcoming economic reports than anyone else, but we have to consider the short window before the question concludes. For instance, after the Fed announces its decision to raise rates (or to leave it unchanged or decrease), there are only 6 days (excluding holidays) until the question concludes. Thus, reducing the probability of inversion. So, I’ll remain at 0% probability Another thing to consider is that foreign countries are also investors in US debt markets. A few major economies have extremely low or negative rates and have found US debt to be more attractive from both yield and creditworthiness perspectives. Additional buying of US debt from these countries would put downward pressure on US yields. Since this situation has persisted for quite some time and would likely affect both the 2 and 10 year rates, I believe that if this assessment is correct the affects will have no further downward pressure on rates unless those rates were to decrease. I think this is very unlikely considering their central bank agendas. In addition, any rate increases in those countries would have upward pressure on rates, but that is very unlikely between now and the end of the question. I’m not changing my probability because of this unless something significant happens. On the other hand, because we are starting from such a historically small spread, any negative news or a continued bearish sentiment in equity markets could cause the 10 year rate to decrease and reduce the spread at any time between now and the end of the question."

The CME Fedwatch website predicts Fed rate movements based on the futures market. Right, now it places a 74% probability that the Fed will raise rates at its December 18-19 meeting by 25 bps (https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html). Since this probability is well known and considered by bond investors, I’ll say that the remaining 24% uncertainty is not already baked into the current 2 year rate and that there should only be a 6.5 basis point (25 bps increase x 26% of uncertainty) increase in the 2 year rate. If that happens, the 2 year adjusts accordingly, and the 10 year rate remains unchanged, the spread reduced to 6.5 bps. At this point, I’ll assume a base rate of 0% probability of inversion. Theoretically, the yield curve should never invert because longer term investors demand a term premium. So, as the 2 year rate increases, the 10 year should increase by and unknown amount. Though, the term premium, as determined by the current spread is very small. In addition, an inversion is a very rare occurrence (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y). My probability remains 0% at this point. Current economic reports also lead bond investors to draw conclusions about rates in the future which can have a positive or negative effect on longer term yields. I don’t claim to have any more incite about upcoming economic reports than anyone else, but we have to consider the short window before the question concludes. For instance, after the Fed announces its decision to raise rates (or to leave it unchanged or decrease), there are only 6 days (excluding holidays) until the question concludes. Thus, reducing the probability of inversion. So, I’ll remain at 0% probability Another thing to consider is that foreign countries are also investors in US debt markets. A few major economies have extremely low or negative rates and have found US debt to be more attractive from both yield and creditworthiness perspectives. Additional buying of US debt from these countries would put downward pressure on US yields. Since this situation has persisted for quite some time and would likely affect both the 2 and 10 year rates, I believe that if this assessment is correct the affects will have no further downward pressure on rates unless those rates were to decrease. I think this is very unlikely considering their central bank agendas. In addition, any rate increases in those countries would have upward pressure on rates, but that is very unlikely between now and the end of the question. I’m not changing my probability because of this unless something significant happens. On the other hand, because we are starting from such a historically small spread, any negative news or a continued bearish sentiment in equity markets could cause the 10 year rate to decrease and reduce the spread at any time between now and the end of the question."

This is expected to increase or at least not decrease inflation supporting the long end of the curve. Additionally it should depress the short end of the curve, so make inversion less likely. 2) However, in the 18 business days since my last forecast on 8th November, the spread decreased by 0.15 percentage points to 0.11 percent, or 0.0083 percentage points per day. This rate has accelerated, and since there are 18 business days to the question closing, it has become more likely that the curve inverts, even if only for a short time due to volatility."

And we have had the same, monthly averages starting July 2018 are: .2823, .2534, .2363, .2913, and .258. Will it make a big move downward in December?

However, the long end of the curve is not rising at the same magnitude as the short rate, partly due to a large demand coming from pension, as pension de-risk by moving to bonds from equity. The Treasuries were also getting sold off this year amid surging issuance, driven by the US tax cut and an increase in fiscal spending.

62424,2018-11-11T06:41:34Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"On 11/10/18 the spread between the 2 and 10 year is only 26 bps, which is a very small margin. The CME Fedwatch website predicts Fed rate movements based on the futures market. Right, now it places a 76% probability that the Fed will raise rates at its December 18-19 meeting by 25 bps (https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html). Since this probability is well known and considered by bond investors, I’ll say that the remaining 24% uncertainty is not already baked into the current 2 year rate and that there should only be a 6 basis point (25 bps increase x 24% of uncertainty) increase in the 2 year rate. If that happens, the 2 year adjusts accordingly, and the 10 year rate remains unchanged, the spread reduced to 20 bps. At this point, I’ll assume a base rate of 0% probability of inversion. Theoretically, the yield curve should never invert because longer term investors demand a time premium. So, as the 2 year rate increases, the 10 year should increase by and unknown amount. Though, the time premium, as determined by the current spread is very small. In addition, an inversion is a very rare occurrence (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y). My probability remains 0% at this point. Current economic reports also lead bond investors to draw conclusions about rates in the future which can have a positive or negative effect on longer term yields. I don’t claim to have any more incite about upcoming economic reports than anyone else, but we have to consider the short window before the question concludes. For instance, after the Fed announces its decision to raise rates (or to leave it unchanged or decrease), there are only 6 days (excluding holidays) until the question concludes. Thus, reducing the probability of inversion. So, I’ll remain at 0% probability Another thing to consider is that foreign countries are also investors in US debt markets. A few major economies have extremely low or negative rates and have found US debt to be more attractive from both yield and creditworthiness perspectives. Additional buying of US debt from these countries would put downward pressure on US yields. Since this situation has persisted for quite some time and would likely affect both the 2 and 10 year rates, I believe that if this assessment is correct the affects will have no further downward pressure on rates unless those rates were to decrease. I think this is very unlikely considering their central bank agendas. In addition, any rate increases in those countries would have upward pressure on rates, but that is very unlikely between now and the end of the question. I’m not changing my probability because of this unless something significant happens. On the other hand, because we are starting from such a historically small spread, any negative news or a continued bearish sentiment in equity markets could cause the 10 year rate to decrease and reduce the spread at any time between now and the end of the question. For the final answer to remain at 0% seems foolish. I’ll add a somewhat arbitrary 10% points to my probability to account for the possibility of negative economic news or random exogenous event. For instance, heightened trade war threats or other negative geopolitical event. I’ll go with 10% for now."

The possibility of a recession in the next six months could be the catalyst that could cause the Fed to change policy and begin to ease rates which would make investors prefer to investment for longer terms at current rates possibly causing an inversion. However, there are no signs of a recession in the short-term (i.e. 12 months) Perception is reality though. If the markets perceives a recession is likely to occur it would cause investors to start investing in longer duration assets farther out on the yield curve (which is needed to cause the longer end yields to fall). Investors would need to perceive there is a potential for rates to remain flat or fall in a reasonable time frame in the future to make the herd rush toward the long end of the curve and cause an inversion.

According to Fed Funds futures, the short end is known with relatively high probability (75% probability of one more 25 basis point increase in Fed Funds and that is what the Fed is telegraphing, as well), which would take the 2-year yield up by almost that amount. It then wouldn't take much of a decline in the 10-year rate (a few basis points) to result in an inversion. I still think it is unlikely, but if the markets start to price in any significant probability of a recession in 2019, the 10-year could drop a few basis points, which would then result in a very slight inversion. I still think the most likely outcome is no inversion, but I give an inversion a higher probability than most forecasters, it appears."
