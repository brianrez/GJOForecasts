Then Omicron could be dominant in the US soon after the middle of the month -- depending on what Delta does nearly independently of Omicron.

Omicron or whatever would need to go from 0% to 70% in 6 weeks. If Delta continues to surge through early January, that's not going to happen. Otoh, if Delta winds down this month, it's still possible. However, I don't think it's likely that Delta will wind down to low levels by the end of December; I suspect it'll still be going at least fairly strong and will likely peak in early January, like last year. So, I think bin 3 has a very low probability. Bin 4 is much more likely, imo. But when Delta winds down, more than one variant may arise at the same time. Omicron will likely spread regardless of what Delta is doing and will likely co-circulate just fine; I don't think it will ""replace"" Delta in any meaningful way. Other variants that escape more or less existing antibody immunity may also start to be visible by bin 4. It's likely that one will do better than the rest, but by how much? I think it's a near certainty that Delta will represent <50% of cases by sometime in bin 4, but it's not clear yet whether one variant will emerge to cause >70.0% of all cases."

It is difficult to figure out how many flights from SA to the US there were a week ago, but I'll estimate 25-30. Omicron is also spreading in Malawi and likely undetected in other countries. So, there were probably at most ~50 flights/week from affected countries to the US, or, say, at most 100 flights in the past 2 weeks, which have seen Omicron cases surge. This would put an estimate of the number of cases already in the US somewhere in the ballpark of 500. We still have way too little information to make firm estimates about anything, but with an estimated doubling time of 5 days, this would make bin 3 implausible. The one factor that keeps bin 3 in the running, imo, is seasonality, as what little data we do have are from spring in SA, whereas Omicron is now heading into winter in the US, which will increase Rt. We have yet to see what it can do in the US."

A couple other variants are, too, but Nu seems to be the worst by far. We need more data to know what this variant is capable of, but the data so far are extremely concerning. While it is important not to jump to very firm conclusions without more data, there is enough data to cause a lot of worry, and South African health professionals are telling us to be very concerned. It's also important to remember that many downplayed Delta early on because ""we didn't have enough data,"" when Indian health professionals told us to be concerned; we don't need to be able to draw firm conclusions to be very concerned. A number of Nu cases have so far been identified in vaccinated people. There is a lot of selection bias in the detection of these cases, though, so it will be important to see how well Nu spreads in the vaccinated and previously infected as time goes on. Delta was dominant in India by mid-March and peaked in early May, and it became dominant in the US by mid-July and peaked in early Sept. Thus, it is conceivable to me that a variant that supersedes Delta to become dominant in SA at the end of November could spread to and within countries faster than Delta did and could become dominant in the US by mid March. Also, note that it's possible that this variant may already be spreading at higher or similar numbers in countries other than SA. It may simply have been detected first in SA because of greater surveillance and because it is causing a surge on top of a very low baseline of Delta cases. In other countries, particularly those with greater Delta spread and/or little surveillance, it could easily go undetected for quite a while. It has been detected almost simultaneously in travelers from SA, Malawi and Egypt, once people started to look. It may be spreading fairly widely within several or many countries in Africa and has likely already spread in small numbers, undetected, to many or most countries around the world. Also, note that it has now been shown conclusively that a new variant can become dominant in a region with low spread; no giant surge is required when a region has a low starting point. https://twitter.com/ariehkovler/status/1464194918038093825"

Increasingly large fractions of the global population are vaccinated or are being vaccinated. It is true that very large proportions of India and Africa remain unvaccinated (each representing a very large group of people) and global vaccination progress is still happening far too slowly, even in many of the most developed countries. Even among the unvaccinated, however, there is now probably some (insufficient!) protection against future infection because of the significant number of people who have already contracted/recovered from at least 1 previous COVID infection. But over time, more and more will be vaccinated. Global new infection rates also seem to have reached a plateau and may be declining now (although they are far too high!). These arguments suggest that over time, the probability of emergence of new variants will decline further from its current value, which I consider to be quite low (only 1 variant ever emerged that caused a major global spike in new cases in over a year and a half)"

Delta is still going strong, and nothing else is, so bins 1 and 2 are out. The Delta wave may largely subside by mid to late Nov. Lambda, Mu, and C.1.2 seem to be the next candidates to supplant Delta once the Delta wave subsides. A new study, just put up on BioRxiv, finds that, ""#Mu variant (B.1.621 lineage), a new #VOI, is highly resistant to the antibodies induced in COVID-19 convalescents and vaccinated people. The most resistant variant tested ever."" https://twitter.com/SystemsVirology/status/1435372949763092485 So I think it's possible that Mu could outcompete other strains in the US to cause >70% of cases at some point in a fall/winter wave. But we still need to see better comparisons with Lambda, etc. We do know that Mu (discovered in January in Colombia) has been found in every state and DC, except Nebraska so far, though: https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/new-mu-covid-19-variant-now-found-in-49-us-states/ The article also says, ""The U.S. saw its peak of Mu variant cases in mid-July but case numbers involving that variant have been declining since."" But only barely. Looking at the numbers, I calculate ~2988 cases in the week ending June 19 (3.7% of all cases) and ~2168 cases in the week ending Aug 28 (0.2% of all cases). Meanwhile, the relative frequency of Mu cases has gone down as Delta has spread. That just says that Delta is more transmissible. But once the Delta wave has subsided, Mu will likely have the advantage. The question is, how much of an advantage will it have over Delta and other strains this fall and winter? I do think we have the potential ingredients for a strong fall/winter wave, though."

Both Lambda and Mu are in the US now. If either were to become the next dominant strain, it would probably take at least 3 months to do so. But 1) neither may be fit enough, 2) there may still be enough Delta around to prevent either from reaching >70.0% of strains, and/or 3) they could compete with each other to the extent that neither becomes dominant. I still think bin 3 is unlikely, at least for now. But I'll increase bin 3 a bit. There's really no way to know where Lambda or Mu will go at this point, but there are a few things in their favor: 1. Given all the surveillance that's happening all over the world, a strain will be identified before it starts to represent a large number of cases. Lambda and Mu have been identified. 2. More studies are needed, but it appears that Lambda and Mu are both highly transmissible and immune escape variants. When Delta emerged and was found to be highly transmissible, it became clear that it would become dominant everywhere it went. If Lambda and/or Mu turn out to actually be highly transmissible and escape some amount of immunity (which seems extremely likely to be the case), then once enough cases are around that one of them doesn't stochastically become extinct in the US (we're probably already past that point), it will spread. 3. No other variant that I know of that is not of the Delta lineage is thought to be both highly transmissible and to escape existing immunity to a meaningful extent. A lot remains to be seen, and variants only rarely become dominant, but at least two of my antennae are now focused on Lambda and Mu. We could well end up with both competing with each other this winter."

Currently there are no new variants of concern according to the WHO (2). Looking at the current distribution of variants that leaves little room for a new strain arriving and taking over before 25 September or 20 November. After that is becomes a lot harder to predict. The virus is now mostly raging in places that do little gene sequencing so it is hard to know what is out there exactly. Most viruses evolve to become more transmittable so it could be possible that a new variant could become dominant much faster than Delta. (3) Another thing to consider is that more people are vaccinated in the US now that when Delta arrived. A new variant would need a lower number of absolute cases to become dominant (assuming vaccinated people will need less testing)

It makes the question harder because there is dependence. For example, Delta decreasing while another strand increases (in nominal values) seems less likely than first glance - as both variants seek the same conditions for transmission. Therefore, new strand is only likely to exceed the growth rate of Delta if it is more contagious than Delta. The most likely way for that to happen is to be resistant against Delta while being susceptible to another strand. That requires two conditions - immunity and mutation, followed by spread.

Also, given that we've only seen ancestral strains and Delta reach >70% since the pandemic started, it could be most reasonable to weight the last bin very high. But variants arise by the stochastic process of genetic mutation and then are selected for or against by their environment. Right now, immunity throughout the world as a whole is low enough that increased transmissibility is the dominant feature that is selected for; immune escape seems to be less important to the virus at the moment. So we can estimate that the chance of formation of new, highly transmissible variants is proportional to the number of cases in the world at any given time. Now that Delta is making its way through many places, we may start to see a peak in cases in the Norther Hemisphere Winter and a peak in the Southern Hemisphere winter. There could be peaks outside these periods if a highly contagious variant starts to spread uncontrolled in an immunologically naive population like that of China, or if a drastic immune-escape variant develops. But I'm going to hypothesize that N and S winters are going to present the greatest risk of generating new variants of relevance to this question and that these variants could spread to the US soon after generation."

So, it would be reasonable to guess that it could be another 2 to 4 months until another strain becomes dominant. But when *one* strain represents more than *70%* of cases is another question. Also, it's quite possible that the next strain to become dominant in the US could be an immune-escape Delta sublineage, although the world is certainly busy brewing up a lot of other options, including Lambda. It will take a new variant that reaches values of Rt (like R0, but varies over time) greater than those of all others that are circulating to get to 70%. Delta still has no real competition that we know of, so I think bin 1 is almost out of the question. But I think the rest of the field is wide open. I'm weighting bin 3 high because the Northern Hemisphere can expect a winter peak as early as January, depending on mitigations, so there will be a lot of opportunities for new strains to spread."
