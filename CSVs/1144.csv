This not only gives them home-court advantage in the Western Conference Playoffs but also in the NBA Finals. Teams with home-court advantage in playoffs since 2008 have had an average win percentage of 60%. The only player to beat the Golden State Warriors and win a Finals for the Eastern Conference in the past decade has been Lebron James (two time champion with the Miami Heat and a one time champion with the Cleveland Cavaliers) but he is on the Lakers and out of playoff contention. As for the Eastern Conference heavyweights this year (Boston, Philly, Milwaukee, and Toronto) they are all plagued with Final's experience unlike the Warriors and all have never made the Finals before with their current rosters. While the Warriors roster has four years of Final experience under it. Therefore its likely that the Western Conference in particular the Warriors are going to advance to and win the NBA Finals."
