According to VOA News, Diplomacy will not stop them (Iran). It is believed that the only thing stopping Iran from escalating conflict is the consequences they would face if they did so. The Intercept states that declining foreign relations with Iran due to the Biden Administration refusing to revive a nuclear deal with Iran. Lastly the South China Morning Post says that Iran was not practicing professional maritime force when they tried to capture an unmanned surface vessel or USV. In conclusion I believe that there is a roughly even chance that there will be a lethal confrontation between Iran and the United Sates military forces either in Iran or at sea before 1 December 2022. This is due to diplomacy will likely not stop Iran from escalating conflict, declining foreign relations between the US and Iran, and Iran's blatant disrespect of professional maritime force."

Since Soleimani's death, many attempts on the lives of Americans have been made. One example was the former national security adviser John Bolton. The justice department charged Sharam Poursafi with a plot to kill Bolton. Poursafi sought out American informants offering 300,000 in exchange for the deed (Justice Dept. Charges Iranian in Plot to Kill John Bolton - The New York Times (nytimes.com)). Evidence supports that there were several attempts to attack U.S. soldiers and assets with missile barrages following the death of Soleimani, (Attacks On US Forces In Iraq Since Soleimani's Assassination | MEMRI). This comes with no surprise provided there were early warning detection systems that allowed U.S. personnel to evacuate the area. Islamic resolve against the West and anti-American narratives have always played a role in the situation. Even with the assassination of Soleimani, practical plans to assassinate Americans over there have failed. More assassination attempts will likely be planned but with little success. The likely hood of an attack mounted by the Iranian government succeeding is unlikely due to our early detection systems and the United States' preferring not to engage the Iranian government. Due to our superior detection systems and the United States not wanting to engage in combat with the Iranians, there is a 30% probability that there will be a lethal conflict between the United States and Iran before December 1st."

Iran has vowed to avenge the death of General Soleimani, however, has shown very little effort in revenge (https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/10/us-charges-iranian-of-plot-to-assassinate-john-bolton.html). The Islamic Republic is motivated by traditional radical Islamic and anti-American sentiment, however much like their work in avenging Gen. Soleimani's death, there has been very little concrete steps taken against the US in recent years. Primarily, the Iranians have utilized proxy groups operating in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen to attack US ships and bases (https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/attacks-iran-backed-militias-us-target-are-us-hasnt-responded-force-20-rcna32892). While these attacks are frequent, they are not conducted by the ""national military force"" of Iran. Additionally, the primary targets of Iranian attacks exist in cyberspace, with the nation mainly targeting US-based businesses and some American infrastructure (https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/iran). Of course, all of these occur in international space, foreign countries, or cyberspace, not in the territory or airspace of the US or Iran. Even despite current high tensions, the conflict between the US and Iran exists in Saudi Arabia, or in Iraq/Syria (https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-saudi-arabia-high-alert-intel-impending-iranian-attack-report). For these many reasons above, I expect a 25% chance of lethal Iranian-American conflict between conventional national forces before December 1."

67942,2022-01-24T03:13:25Z,1,[14.0],[14.0],"The Biden administration will likely take drastic steps to avoid a confrontation with Iran. First, Biden has focused much of his agenda on the economy to the point that he implied that saving the economy was more important than the risk of people spreading omicron in the workplace (although those remarks could be interpreted in a number of ways, WH speech Dec 21, 2021). Further, with his domestic agenda in tatters and ahead of the midterms, the President now needs to focus on the economy to bolster the argument that Dems are capable of governing. At present, 30% of the world's oil is transported through the Strait of Hormuz, and any military confrontation with Iran could lead the country to try and blockade those ships. Yes, the American Navy would like prevail eventually, in the short term, oil prices would rise leading to voters paying more for gas, which has historically been an overemphasized marker of economic success for Americans. Second, the President has shown little appetite for foreign adventures. Biden's experience as the Vice-President overseeing eight years of conflict in Afghanistan seems to have soured him on the prospect of sending in troops. Even as members of his own party called for him to reconsider the Afghanistan pull-out, he went ahead with it and gave a pointed, short speech after the debacle when Kabul fell where he offered no apologies or second thoughts. He was adamant that there was no point in remaining there. Granted, fresh hostilities might, in his mind, create the grounds for a new mission, but I'm going to give the President's mindset significant weight here. Finally, the President faces two other military situations that will likely not go away: Ukraine and Taiwan. Focusing on Iran or committing troops there would likely lead to a broader conflict, bringing in proxy groups and possibly leading Iran to use its missile capabilities to attack the 70k US troops still in the Middle East. The President and US Military leaders--in the face of threats from Russia and China--will likely need all their resources available if either of those situations go hot. I'm giving it 14% still because an accident, miscommunication, or minor incident could possibly lead to at least one death, which the question stipulates."

At heart are uranium enrichment and sanctions. The sanctions are what exacerbates the whole situation, but it is only the continued enrichment of uranium that will lead to any conflict in my opinion. Throwing in Russia to the mix complicates it further. Russia loves PR victories, especially ones that showcase any role as a mediator. With Russia having an active role in convincing Iran to slow enrichment, they are in the running for a major PR victory. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/21/what-next-for-iran-and-russia-ties-after-raisi-putin-meeting. Since the criteria for this question is a single death, that raises the odds; but the American appetite for conflict is very low. OTOH a surgical airstrike elicits much less of a reaction (in the US), and are certainly on the table. The chances that somebody gets killed collaterally in an airstrike on some facility is high. Talks have been happening in Vienna, but awkwardly, Iran and the US only communicate via other European diplomats; so hard to tell how effective they are. Will raise or lower depending on how quickly sanctions on Iran are eased."

Iran would be politically obligated to retaliate, and thus could also be potentially costly. On the other hand, if Iran remains totally intransigent and refuses to negotiate, support could build for some sort of action as they get closer to building a working nuclear weapon.
