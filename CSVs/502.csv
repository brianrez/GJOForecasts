Old deals have been changed, modified, cheated, destroyed, renegotiated etc. the dollar has supported international trade and international systems for the last generation.

It is clear that China’s economic power is not an indication of its banking system and its minimal use in the global economy. China’s ambition to advance the RMB as an International currency has been stunted by its geopolitical actions such as territorial disputes in the South China sea and the Indian/Chinese border, the Status of Hong Kong and threats against Taiwan and created mistrust. An adoption of the RMB relies on the trust and confidence of providing a stable, stable and reliable haven with no geopolitical risk which is a difficult sell by the Chinese government. Domestically China has a large unregulated shadow banking system that is indicative of a mature financial system. The People’s bank of China has been developing the digital Yuan to replace physical cash. This will allow the Government to own the ledger that records and traces every transaction via blockchain technologies by freely conducting surveillance of any data travelling through the system. This would probably diminish the appeal to the citizens of developed nations who desire a degree of privacy. Therefore I will suggest that the RMB’s share of global payments currency to remain at its current low level. https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/chinas-digital-yuan-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work.html https://www.fpri.org/article/2020/09/understanding-chinas-digital-yuan/"
