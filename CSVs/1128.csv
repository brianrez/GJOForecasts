It is worth pausing to question the impact the USMCA will have on the U.S. automotive industry. The changes to the law predictably drive up the cost of purchasing a North American vehicle given the increased wages and higher standards applied to manufactures looking to trade duty-free. At a time when American automotive factories are closing in North America, a Republican-backed U.S. Congress would be reluctant to pass anything that may scath the latest economic growth being experienced in the first quarter year.
