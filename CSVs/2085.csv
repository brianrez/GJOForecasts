I don't see it getting into the monthly categories for business in the timeframe, as the question requires it to be on a list in October and the October monthly sales are only published in November. It is not able to get into the best sellers list until 18th October as the results are backward looking by two weeks. For that week (18th), it has not sold the full week, it has taken from 29th - 3rd, but it is its opening salvo (but even on amazon overall it is not getting out of the 20's and their bar is very low).

AND it is coming out in Christmas shopping season 4. There are several other books on Amazon about forecasting, there is interest in this topic. 5. A book needs to sell about 4000 copies in one week to get on the NYT best selling booklist. (caveat-completely unsubstantiated statistic, found on an author’s blog) 6. I have read numbers between 3000 and 10000 participants in GJP. Human curiosity being what it is, many of them will want to buy a copy. Just to see what Mr. Tetlock says about the project they were involved with. Especially those of us now participating in GJ Inc. Wannabe superforecasters like me want to glean helpful info. If half of GJP participants go buy the book when it first comes out, there is a good possibility one week could see over 4000 copies bought, between participants and general public. 7. Media articles about forecasting and GJP have put forecasting on the public’s radar. (Even I heard about it by 2014, and my teenagers will tell you I am the least likely, uncoolest person to know anything that’s trendy.)"

So I am not so sure how aggressive the marketing is on this book with top influencers in the Amazon market or how well targeted those galley copies that did go out were. I could not find the book on sites that typically provide ARCs to me either. Books that are very successful typically are easily available to reviewers and known market influencers. Also, there are some phenomenal non-fiction titles coming out in September and November, so it will have a LOT of competition. I think Black Flags:Rise of ISIS will be way up there. Superforecasting though, I'm not sure. If I had been able to get a copy, I could predict this a lot better. It concerns me that the people I've talked to had reservations about the book. I'm giving it a 38% chance though, because I think it will have some following in the IC and with forecasters. It IS a hot topic. I can't see it being near the top if it is though.

I think Amazon, because it is SO widely used, is a decent starting point from which to make judgments about popularity among consumers. Adding to that--if a book is top on an Amazon list, that probably speaks not only to the content but to the PR team behind ""selling"" the idea of the book to others. If they've managed to ""sell"" it to Amazon that is a great start & it's visibility and the awareness consumers have of it will only increase. So based off that, I think that Superforecasting has a pretty decent shot of at least making it on to the NYT list in any category by the end of October."

Every week is a new race. -if the book physically ships out of the book seller’s warehouse weeks before the pub date, it goes from “pre-order” status to “sold” — and thus, it does not get counted in launch week -bulk orders are weighted differently. If this book is used as a textbook, not every sale will count -500-1,000 sales are needed to hit Amazon's list, and the NYT list is assumed to require 10x that: 5-9k -there's seasonal variations, so the bar raises & lowers.

However, I don't think that ""Superforecasting"" will be quite as popular or successful as ""The Signal and the Noise"" (which seems to be the strongest book in its category, and thus hardly a typical case). I give it a 25% chance of being that successful, for a 12% chance of being on the bestseller list by the end of October."
35,2015-09-03T02:09:55Z,1,[59.0],[59.0],From what I understand the book only needs to be at the top of it's category. It doesn't directly compete with the latest fiction novel.

I would love to see it happen, but intuition says ""not a wide enough audience"". Let's have a show of hands amongst all of us, the early beta-testers of GJP II. How many are going to buy?"
52,2015-09-02T13:05:55Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"It seems common for authors of this kind of niche book to get on various main-stream media (TV)/syndicated media (Radio) outlets BEFORE the official release of the book. I have not seen/heard the good professor on any segments as of yet. Getting on at least one major mass audience outlet seems like a prerequisite for getting on ""The List""."
71,2015-09-02T11:22:10Z,1,[70.0],[70.0],Taking a stab..
64,2015-09-02T10:53:19Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"Base case: I checked latest NYT 15 non-fiction books. One (Jimmy Carter's) had 59 reviews on Amazon; the next lowest was about 150 reviews; it went all the way up to a few thousand. In contrast, Tetlock's ""Expert Political Judgement"" has only 34 reviews since 2006. I can;t see why the new book would do spectacularly better. GJP audience: I don't see a huge audience among the GJP participants. If 20,000 took part in GJP, about half hardly participated (based on my 10-person group sample). Of the others, I doubt more than 15% will actually buy the book. And, many of those are probably the type who will put it on their list and get to it, as part of their reading. Finally, the subject-matter is a step removed from being personally actionable. The idea that crowds have wisdom is interesting, but it is not enough motivation for most readers to invest the time in knowing more than a high-level summary."
68,2015-09-02T10:06:06Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],"I understand it takes about 10,000 sales within a week for a book to get on the NYT Bestseller list. The GJP and Tetlock have been getting media coverage over the last few years and are probably well known by now among people interested in the subject. However, my simplistic approach is to say that there were 20,000 participants in GJP's Season 4, and a large proportion of them are going to buy the book, many may have pre-ordered it already. I think there's a strong likelihood that the book will show up on the Best Seller List in the first week after release."
63,2015-09-02T03:30:57Z,1,[66.0],[66.0],"Joining at the high end at 66%. Apparently, the list is updated every Sunday, so last available date this year is 25 October ... presumably they do the final tally a day or two earlier, maybe Friday at the end of the business week, which is 23 October. Just over 3 weeks to surge in the ranks. I think it happens."

49,2015-09-02T01:14:47Z,1,[42.0],[42.0],1. Superforecasting comes out September 29. http://amzn.to/1PKffFp So Superforecasting has only a month to get on the list.
48,2015-09-02T01:03:25Z,1,[99.0],[99.0],"I just went with 99 percent on this one. This might be a rookie mistake, not being used to non-market-based platform. But my rationale is based on the thought that Dr. Tetlock's other book for a popular audience, on expert judgement, was a best seller; he's gotten ample positive press on his ground-breaking research since then; and since this question really concerns how strong early buzz on the book would be vs. it's objective quality, I'd say it will get a lot, lot of positive word-of-mouth from the 1,000s of folks who've volunteered for the Good Judgment Project before now--many of whom are liable to be influential in getting others to read, and at least some of whom (me) post a lot about this stuff to Facebook, where people can read about it and get interested. I might be over-confident about my hit-picking skills for non-fiction, but I did post the Economist's article on Picketty's Capital in the 21st Century to Facebook when they reviewed it in French, and said how eager I was to read the English translation."
41,2015-09-02T00:44:10Z,1,[30.0],[30.0],"Malcolm Gladwell has several books on the NYTB currently, including Outliers ~7 years after it was released. I anticipate that Superforecasters could fit into the Gladwell/Silver niche for popular social science with obvious real world applications. I'm hedging because I'm not sure that there's all that much mainstream interest in this -- e.g. there have been 1,700 NYT articles that have mentioned ""Malcolm Gladwell,"" compared to 0 that have mentioned ""superforecasting,"" 3 with ""Good Judgment Project"" (only 1 since 2012), and 53 that have mentioned ""Tetlock."""
