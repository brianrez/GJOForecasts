From the beginning of the month to now the spot exchange rate as fluctuated around 5.4-5.5 approximately. Moreover, if we look at the past couple years around this time, we do not see extreme fluctuations of the spot exchange rate (2017 saw the spot exchange rate hover around 3.85 for November).

My assessment is grounded in my analysis of the spot rate of the lira-dollar exchange rate for the last five years, recorded by Bloomberg (https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/USDTRY:CUR). The spot exchange rate currently is 5.5013 (accurate as of 13 November 10:20). In a five year span, the spot exchange rate has only fluctuated equal to or greater than a half a percentage point within a month span in July-August 2018. The spot exchange rate in a five year span has stabilized in November of each year, with the exception of 2016, fluctuating no more than 0.33 points. We can expect that the spot exchange rate will stabilize in November 2018, as it has historically done the last few years, including the first half of November 2018 as it has only fluctuated 0.03 points. Lastly, the spot exchange rate has remained between 5.00 and 6.00 since early October 2018. Therefore, I conclude, with a high degree of certainty, that the end-of-day closing value for the Turkish lira against the US dollar on 30 November will be between 5.00 and 6.00, inclusive."

This makes it much less likely than I originally assumed that he will let the central bank (which is under his control) raise rates (which is the standard macroeconomist prescription to such predicaments. It is for example believed to have gotten Argentina out of their recent currency crisis).
