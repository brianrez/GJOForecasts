While Israel and the U.S. push such an alliance to counter what Israel considers to be an existential threat in Iran, Saudi Arabia would put itself in harm's way if it lined up with Israel. Saudi Arabia is closer to Iran and does not have the same defensive capabilities that Israel has. Even if the two countries shared technology as part of an alliance, Israel would not share everything because of its military edge doctrine. The United States' commitment to defend Saudi in event of a war is questionable given U.S. public opinion. That is why Saudi Arabia has been willing to talk to Iran in past months and uses less combative rhetoric than Israel."

107366,2022-09-08T00:22:21Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"Saudi Arabia is unique among Arab countries for its occasional support of the Israeli state. However, this support does not mean relations are likely to be normalized. Saudi Arabia has many international interests in its Arab neighbors, from trade to mutual defense, and normalizing relations could harm those relations. Israel is not a major trade partner of Saudi Arabia but it is a mutual ally in opposition to Iran, who poses a security threat to both nations. This mutual threat does not constitute enough to justify normalization but it does mean that the two countries will continue to provide limited aid to one another in the future."

Israel and Morocco recently opened ties, but Morocco is known to be more hospitable than Saudi Arabia to its Jewish population, as well as seeing considerable benefits in terms of commerce from such recognition with Israel. Saudi Arabia does not need these benefits, and they would be negligible as is, not to mention Saudi Arabia's noted hostility to Israel."
