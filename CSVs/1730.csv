An extension of the existing East China Sea ADIZ to cover part of the South China Sea would count.

The 60,000-ton Liaoning left its home port June 25 along with the destroyers Jinan and Yinchuan for what was described as a weeks-long, transregional training mission. A report on the defense ministry website said its complement of J-15 jet fighters and helicopters have been conducting flight training along its voyage. According to the official Xinhua News Agency on Monday, the mission aims to “strengthen coordination among the vessels and improve the skills of crew and pilots in different marine regions.” A highlight of the mission will be the flotilla’s port call in Hong Kong to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the People’s Liberation Army garrison’s presence in the semi-autonomous Chinese city and former British colony. Though no official date has been announced, the Liaoning is expected to arrive on Friday. While U.S. and other visiting sailors tend to gravitate toward the city’s Wanchai nightlife district, the PLA navy says its officers and soldiers will be attending “various exchanges and activities with Hong Kong residents and the PLA garrison.” The ships will also be open for visits by the public. The Liaoning has exercised in the South China Sea, although Beijing has been vague on what role it intends it to ultimately play."""

The Taiwan arms sale, the reported plans to restrict imports of steel and aluminium, the US Navy Destroyer sailing within 12 miles of a disputed island in the Paracel Islands and the THAAD deployment have all provoked a response from the Chinese government. In a recent Reuters article, President Xi was quoted: “The US deployment of an advanced anti-missile system in South Korea gravely harms the strategic security interests of China, Russia and other countries in the region. Beijing and Moscow are steadfastly opposed to the THAAD deployment and seriously suggest that relevant countries stop and cancel the installation”. It was also said that China and Russia would take the “necessary measures” to protect their interests. (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-thaad-russia-idUSKBN19O0N8). It’s possible that a response could entail an ADIZ over part of the South China Sea, though with construction still ongoing its unlikely to be within a month."

According to a Pentagon official: “The warship conducted a “man overboard” rescue drill while passing by the island. The particular exercise was intended to show China that the US would operate anywhere on the high seas in accordance with international law.” China’s department of defence; Sr. Col. Rem Guoqiang said in a statement “This behaviour by the US military is a show of force to promote the militarisation in the region, and would very easily lead to accidents on the sea and in the air” (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/24/world/asia/south-china-sea-us-navy-warship-spratly-islands.html?_r=0) This move, whether in response to the Chinese SU-30 jets interception on a U.S. WC-135 Constant Phoenix aircraft or alongside it, would be a case in China’s favour to introduce an ADIZ over the South China Sea. (http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/us-protests-intercept-by-chinese-jets-china-blames-us) However, with Vietnam and the Philippines agreeing to “keep tensions in check” with China, and Lu Kang (China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman) acknowledging an improving situation in the South China Sea, suggests that an ADIZ would be unlikely within the next two months. Plus, the US Navy regularly conducts Fonops, so this response is nothing out of the ordinary."

The KJ-200 AEW&C aircraft, which are currently in service with the Chinese military, are expected to be replaced by younger and more advanced KJ-500 aircraft. Having entered into service with the Chinese Air Force in early 2015, the KJ-500, with the help of a satellite communications dome atop it, is reportedly capable of tracking nearly 100 vehicles simultaneously. The bigger radar array of the KJ-500 also creates more effective situation awareness and allows guidance and control of enemy and friendly planes, while smaller radars mounted on the nose and rear fuselage guarantee additional coverage."""

The Trump administration, however, had other plans. Just before the two leaders sat down to dine on steak, Trump authorised a major unilateral use of force, with the US military firing 59 cruise missiles against a Syrian military airfield in retaliation for President Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons against civilians days earlier. When Trump informed Xi of the strike later in the evening, the subtext was likely laid on so thick that Xi could have cut it with his steak knife: the United States remains a superpower and the only country both capable and willing of this sort of unilateral action. Tellingly, the Chinese Foreign Ministry, while noting the strike, did not offer outright condemnation. If this wasn’t a moment of humiliation for Xi with nationalistic audiences back home looking for signs of strength against a US leader who had been vocal about pushing back against China, it was at least a moment of forced weakness. As Xi told Trump as they sat down to dine, China saw “a thousand reasons to make the China-US relationship work; [there is] no reason to break it”. We have little evidence that the Trump administration planned the authorisation of the Syria strike to coincide with the summit or to send China any particular message, but the timing was an uncanny reminder for Beijing of the differences that remain between the US and China; that the two remain near-peers in the realm of contemporary great powers, and not absolute peers as China would will it. What’s more, the strike all but bumped what should have been a major moment in US-China relations to below-the-fold as global media immediately seized on the Trump administration’s dalliance with unilateralism in the Middle East. Indeed, just as unexpected conflagrations in the region stemming from the Arab Uprisings drew attention away from the Obama administration’s “rebalance” to Asia, so did Trump’s Syria strikes depress the significance of the Mar-a-Lago meeting. Even if unintentional, Xi may have drawn important lessons from Trump’s decision on Thursday evening to authorise strikes on Syria. The decision represented both a capricious reversal in policy and a dangerously impulsive willingness to escalate. For China, whose foreign policy bureaucracy continues to wrangle with the overall direction of Trump’s foreign policy amid mixed signals, factoring these tendencies in US decision-making on the North Korean problem and the South China Sea will be a necessity."""
