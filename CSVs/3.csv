I believe there is an 8% chance that this will happen. This is because the anniversary of the Ukraine invasion has caused the UN to take stronger action against Russia. There was a call for the withdrawal of troops and a ceasefire. In this vote, only 32 countries abstained and seven voted against the resolution. This makes me confident that there will not be 60 countries that vote against or abstain in a resolution to condemn Russia by name. In addition, when I ran a regression test on how a country's polyarchy score affects the way they vote, it helped my prediction because I got the results that as votes against the resolution increase, the polyarchy score decreases. This is consistent with the historical context as well as current events."

The likelihood has dropped because, with the one-year anniversary of the war coming up on February 20th, there is a greater sense of urgency to condemn Russia and stop the destruction of Ukraine. Additionally, based on the past two resolutions, it is unlikely that countries that voted for the resolution would change their votes in the next resolution."
109396,2023-02-17T19:09:34Z,3,[25.0],[-5.0],"I still believe that there is a relatively low chance that 60 or more countries in the UN General Assembly will vote against or abstain from voting on a resolution in any way condemning Russia by name. I think that I would lower my percentage down to 25% given that little changed between the votes when Ukraine first invaded Russia and the vote in October, and both of those were at least 20 votes away from reaching that mark. From the research I have conducted, it seems that the more severe the resolution is in condemning Russia (ie. one that sought to suspend Russia from the U.N.’s Geneva-based Human Rights and have them pay reparations), the less countries that will vote for the resolution. However, simply condemning Russia by name has not reached too much opposition, though more than I initially had expected. The resolution that will be voted on next Friday which asks for peace and ceasefire will be very telling and I am interested to see those results."
109424,2023-02-17T16:02:37Z,2,[9.0],[-1.0],"I amended my prediction and now believe that it is less likely that 60 or more countries will abstain from voting or vote against condemning Russia, due to the new UN resolution drafted that stressed ""the need to reach, as soon as possible, a comprehensive, just and lasting peace"" in recognition of the 1 year anniversary of the initial Russian invasion of Ukraine. Due to this resolution, I doubt that a significant number of countries would be willing to side with Russia publicly so shortly after, unless they already had in previous UN votes."

This prediction is primarily because in the last UN General Assembly resolution, only 40 countries either voted to condemn Russia or abstained from voting. Because Russia has not scaled back their invasion, and in fact military actions have worsened, it is unlikely that more countries than before will be unwilling to condemn Russia."
109396,2023-02-10T19:06:26Z,2,[30.0],[-5.0],"I believe that there is a 30% chance that 60 or more countries in the UN General Assembly will either vote against or abstain from voting on a resolution in any way condemning Russia by name. When Russia first invaded Ukraine on February 24th, 2022, the UN voted to condemn Russia, 141 countries voted in favor, 35 abstained, and 5 voted against (of the 193 member states). This means that only 40 states voted against or abstained from voting to condemn Russia. In a recent vote to condemn Russia, a resolution was passed by the UN with 143 in favor, 5 against (Belarus, North Korea, Nicaragua, Russia, Syria), and 34 abstaining (China, India, and some African, Latin American, and Central Asian countries). This means that 39 countries voted against or abstained from voting on this resolution. Between the two votes for these two resolutions, there was not much of a shift. For example, Iraq and Angola abstained in March but voted against the second time. Eritrea moved from voting against to abstaining, and Nicaragua did the opposite. For these reasons, I do not think much will change in a vote for another resolution. Since these votes did not have 60 or more countries voting against or abstaining from voting, I doubt that will change in the near future. However, there is always the possibility that the relationships between these countries and Russia shifts, or Russia takes something a step further which could alter states’ votes. Additionally, a combined total of 87 countries voted against or abstained from voting on a resolution concerning Russia paying war reparations to Ukraine, though this is different from simply condemning them without the addition of reparations."

It is even more unlikely because now that the war has been intensifying and the US has started providing military aid, there is more reason to vote on the side of the US."

The long and short of it was, you'll get lots of abstentions/votes against with resolutions that do anything more than reaffirm the UN's commitment to state sovereignty. There were a lot of abstentions when resolutions passed last year to remove Russia from the UN Human rights council, and calling for it to pay reparations."
