63964,2019-01-03T00:11:15Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],Even the socialist utopia of California has enough decision makers who know that the state cannot manage its own public utility.

57797,2018-12-26T14:59:30Z,2,[9.0],[3.0],There seem to be 3 options: - Bankruptcy - Pay any liability by issuing bonds that are paid back through increases on electricity bills spread out over time (was the solution used to deal with last year’s wildfires) - PG&E splits up to isolate the parts of the company that will hold liability for wildfires. That portion of the company can then go bankrupt (I am guessing this won’t resolve the quetsion as a ‘yes’) or it can seek its own financing.
