On January 19th, 2023, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA) announced that they would vote whether or not to strike on May 1, 2023 in response to the company's technology meltdown in December. The union choose this date to give themselves time to prepare and give Southwest customers the opportunity to book elsewhere. While Southwest employees claim they are tired of apologizing to customers, I think the employees' and pilots' concern for customer satisfaction is too high to strike unexpectedly within the month. Despite the fact that this question applies to all airlines, Southwest publicly faced the most issues in December 2022, and if they are unlikely to go on strike before 3/1, I don't believe pilots from any other airlines will."

You can read about them here:http://www3.alpa.org/publications/Flying_The_Line_1/flying_the_line_1.htmlAnd here:http://www3.alpa.org/publications/Flying_The_Line_II/flying_the_line_II.htmlTaking nothing else into account, that gives us about a 4% chance of another pilot strike occurring in the next 100 days.The first condition I want to consider here is the rate of pilot strikes after a union has voted to authorize a strike. This sort of data is very hard to come by. A quick ALPA search throws up a lot of hits.https://www.alpa.org/pages/search#q=strike&sort=relevancyI don’t know that a 4% base rate warrants sifting through all of them. Major airlines don’t go on strike all that often, so given the high number of hits on that search, we’re probably safe in guessing that ratio is low too. A report from the US Government Accountability Office seems to back that up.https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-03-652Even if labor activity is ramping up in recent years, it’s only ramping up in a relative sense. As the report states, the government and the airlines both have strong incentives to hammer out a deal rather than deal with a strike. The report might be outdated, but those incentives haven’t changed.That said, a parallel case involving railroad unions continues to be fraught.https://www.npr.org/2022/11/21/1137640529/railroads-freight-rail-unions-vote-contract-strikeAirlines and railways are both governed by the same law, so both cases are worth watching. ALPA even has a graphic about it on their website. https://www.alpa.org/news-and-events/air-line-pilot-magazine/the-landing-railway-standards-actIt’s hard to imagine the airline negotiation going as poorly as the railway negotiation. Even with everyone back to square one, however, the railway union seems confident: “This can all be settled through negotiations and without a strike. A settlement would be in the best interests of the workers, the railroads, shippers and the American people.”https://ble-t.org/news/split-decision-unions-for-railroad-engineers-and-conductors-take-different-routes-in-freight-rail-contract-ratification-vote/It’s certainly not a one-to-one comparison, but if the railroads are confident they can avoid a strike at their current stage, then I’m confident that the airlines can do the same. Recent news is also encouraging:https://www.travelmarketreport.com/News/articles/United-Airlines-Boosts-Pilot-Pay-During-Labor-Negotiationshttps://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/15/delta-gets-closer-to-labor-deal-with-pilots-union-says.htmlI think the probability of a strike here is very low until new reports indicate otherwise."

Yes, there is a lot of noise in the media recently about Delta pilots’ vote to authorize a strike and the perception of leverage that the pilots of several airlines now have from taking such votes, but generating that attention and leverage is the point of their actions—a work stoppage is not the goal. The odds are low too because the system of mandatory cool-off periods and compulsory arbitration also really stacks the deck against would-be strikers. Back in the spring, Alaska pilots voted along lines similar to Delta’s recent move to strike, and emerged five months later with a favorable deal. (And Alaska is also not considered “major” here, somewhat strangely.)"
