From this data alone Modi seems to be the obvious choice of the Indian population with very weak opposition. Additionally, the approval ratings for Modi have been very high throughout his time in office. The approval percentages have ranged from 88% to 63% throughout his first term as Prime Minister (2). This further cements his position, making it easier for him to win against competitors. Modi's current policy and global trends also increase the likelihood of his re-election. For example, Modi's policies have generally leaned towards populism and nationalism for the Indian people (3). Given the current global trend for nationalist leaders and sentiment, it would be likely that he be re-elected. Lastly, Modi's recent confrontation with Pakistan, India's long term rival, has boosted his approval ratings and has made him a very appealing choice for those in India. (4)"

Modi will likely remain in power because rather than choosing an entirely religious platform, his campaign platform is one of nationalism. This message unites the some of the ideologically different Hindu populations as Modi is not seen as an ideologue nor does he appear to ""pamper the minorities"" (2). There are, however, still several economic questions that Modi must address. Unemployment in India is rising and the country's youths are moving into cities for education and job opportunities. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of jobs, so there are more qualified individuals than there are vacancies. In rural parts of India, support for Modi is expected to stay strong because communities have benefited from cheaper cooking gas and electricity, as well as access to toilets and more schools (3). Another sign pointing towards Modi's expected success is the global trend of growing nationalism. While the opposition party in India has some support, the power of that party (called Congress) remains within one family - the Gandhi's. The public has resisted this form of contemporary monarchy (in more countries than just India), and have responded with the election of nationalist leaders, such as Modi. 1. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/post-pulwama-pm-narendra-modis-ratings-rise-by-7-to-52-poll/articleshow/68350217.cms 2. https://www.bbc.com/news/resources/idt-sh/Modis_India 3. https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/324025"

His base is the largest demographic in India (the country is 80% Hindu), and he has significant funding. There are a couple other factors to take into account, however. We can’t really say that because he did well in the first election he will do well in the second since his platform has changed, (the 2014 campaign was based off job creation and economic development) and he made a bunch of promises that some feel he hasn’t kept - there’s unhappiness over agrarian distress, unemployment, demonetization, the Ayodhya temple. A lot will depend on his response to the attack in Kashmir - it seems like he’s taking a strong approach which will satisfy his base but cause division, if people feel that he handles it poorly there is a greater potential that he will lose the upcoming election."

63828,2019-01-10T12:04:43Z,10,[67.0],[-10.0],"Update to my previous analysis: Correlation between NDA seats and UPA seats • In an earlier analysis, I estimated distributions for the amount of seats we can expect each party to receive. These distributions, as with all mathematical models, were simplifications of reality. In this update, I address one simplification – the fact that seats lost by NDA might go to UPA. Here I’m mostly looking at the elections 1991 – 2014 (before that, BJP hadn’t really gained momentum). Also, I’m looking at coalitions rather than parties – the reason is simply that I have already produced models for coalitions, not for parties. • There’s a strong correlation between INC and BJP seats (0.933). Taken together, the two coalitions take, on average, 78% of seats. • So we can think about the election in this way – imagine a world where INC starts with 100% of seats. Then the election involves people going in and casting their votes, and for each non-NDA vote, we subtract a seat from NDA. On average, 78% of votes subtracted from NDA in this way will be assigned to UPA. The other 22% will be assigned to the non-coalition parties. • In my earlier analysis, I arrived at the following distribution for the NDA seats we can expect at the next election. (I did create two distributions for NDA, but after analysing state polls, I’m wary of using poll data.) NDA ~ N(258, 542) • So if we model NDA as above, we can model UPA as dependent on NDA. Simply, NDA takes 78% of the seats that NDA does not get: UPA = (543 – NDA) * 0.78 • In this model, I’m going to assume that a coalition with more seats will win the election. This is an oversimplification of how minority governments form, but it’s approximately correct – and good enough for the model. Where NDA wins 238 seats, UPA wins 238 seats. Where NDA is more successful, UPA is less successful, vice-versa. So, if NDA has more than 238 seats, NDA will form government, and where NDA has fewer than 238 seats, UPA will form government. • (Note: In this model, there’s no real need to model majority governments and minority governments separately.) • So the steps from here are simple: all we have to do is, using the NDA distribution above, calculate the probability that NDA will win 238 or more seats. This probability (you can calculate using a spreadsheet) is 64.44%. • The probability changes very little if you play around with the total % of seats taken by the two coalitions. • So which of my approaches is better? This captures a part of reality that my previous analysis does not catch – although it has its own simplifications, it feels better than my previous analysis. The exception would be the economic factors in my previous analysis. So I want to apply equal weights to a) this analysis and b) my economic model from before, but no weight to c) poll data or d) my distribution model from before. That puts the probability of NDA forming government at the mean of 64.44 and 69.29%, which comes out to 66.87%."
