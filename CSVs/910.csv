Trump has 0% loyalty to anyone when they cease being useful to him. He could very easily blame Pence for the entire covid response, and I fully expect he will, if he feels it's necessary. It would certainly shake things up, and make for good tv. He also likes to distract and get news attention when it's needed, so I think this would actually be a genius move. Especially when Biden doesn't have the enthusiastic support that he was hoping for, it would suck the wind out of the news cycle for Biden, which would be the point. She remains oddly loyal to Trump it seems."

The reason that I am giving a percentage here as high as 10% is simply because of Trump's showmanship- he is known to love a good plot twist, and theoretically it could be a smart political move to try and sway middle-ground women in favor of the Republican ticket now should it include a woman as Vice President. This may be even more probable since Begala made his claim on March 2, as Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, promised to name a woman as his running mate in a debate with Bernie Sanders on March 15, so Trump could use this as a tactic to match Biden and block him from using the ""female VP"" card to his advantage. However, despite all this, it still seems highly improbable that this will actually happen. For one, current VP Mike Pence is a very ""stable"" candidate, contrary to Trump's colorful personality that many traditional GOP members dislike, and who has already proven himself capable of the position. Additionally, a change in running mate when running for reelection has only been done three times in U.S. history, and the most recent instance was when President Franklin D. Roosevelt ran for an unprecedented third term with a new running mate in 1940. Many Americans, Democrat and Republican alike, agree that Pence has been a very capable leader in his position at the head of the COVID-19 response task force, and he has a strong favorability rating among most Republicans, making him a reliable partner. Even if Trump does decide to dump Pence, there is no guarantee that he would replace him with Haley, or even if Haley would accept the position. This seems like an idea that might sound okay on paper, but in all likelihood will not work out in practice, if it is even attempted at all."

It wouldn't make much of a difference as voters don't vote based on the bottom of the ticket for the most part. The GOP also might want to avoid the association of their next nominee (another prediction) with Trump and see Haley is a viable bridge candidate between the new GOP or the Trump GOP and the old GOP. Far more likely is the odds Nikki Haley runs in 2024 (95%), wins the nomination (40%, plurality leader in a crowded field), and becomes the first female U.S. President (65% in a one-on-one matchup, but overall: .95 x .4 x.65)."

Trump is an unconventional politician however and there is a chance (probably <10%) that he would chose to move on from Pence. Nikki Haley seems like a strange replacement however, many have theorized that Trump originally picked Pence to appeal to Republican party elites Nikki Haley would be in the same vein so it seems odd to dump Pence for her. If Trump was to replace Pence it would likely be with someone he is personally close with, as that is how he has filled out much of his staff."

Petits-Doigts will pick up no new female or minority voters this year; and at least some actual Christians seem to be catching on and so won't vote for the Current Incumbent even if Pence is still on the ticket.
