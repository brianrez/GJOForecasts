In July, this number was at 5.4% (https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm). For the 12-month CPI percent change to dip below 3.1% for September, we would need to see severe deflation, likely caused by COVID-19 or a remarkable market crash. However, COVID-19 recovery has continued and government spending seems set to increase, assuming that some form of the proposed multi-trillion dollar infrastructure bill is passed (https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/09/30/us/government-shutdown-infrastructure). Therefore, it seems incredibly unlikely (although not impossible) that such a sharp decrease in CPI would occur in such a short amount of time."

As the Federal Reserve continues to print more money to support the economy after its catastrophic downturn in 2020, the inflation rate will continue to increase. M1 money supply grew from 4.7 billion in April 2020 to almost 20 billion in August 2021. This indicates absurdly high inflation, which translates to a much higher CPI. A higher CPI is great to keep business afloat but obviously poor for consumers. As long as the government prints more money to pump up the economy and prevent collapse, CPI will grow in turn. As of right now, CPI is currently well above 3.1%, sitting around 5.3% in August. For CPI to become lower than 3.1% would mean an immense economic collapse or shut down which is unforeseen at this point."

Here's a good thread from the White House Council of Economic advisors showing that some sectors had a strong spike in April but also that prices are still generally below pre-pandemic prices in some areas. To stay below 3.1% the average over the coming months would have to be pretty low. I'm not entirely ruling that out though, there are a lot of temporary things going on like a spike in lumber prices and a shortage of semiconductors and things like that. There are a lot of unknowns with the pandemic and reopening so it's possible some prices drop as things get back to normal. But overall it seems most likely that we see above average inflation which makes over 3.1% most likely."

Current pressure from reinitiation of manufacturing activity, supply chain pressures, pent-up demand, unused consumer liquidity flowing into consumption, consumer relief optimism, wealth effects from stock market performance, and fiscal stimulus should be expected to wrench the trend up over the next several quarters. That wrench move should begin to manifest by 3Q2021, and then could continue to accelerate into 2022"

We've already passed 1.7% (260.280 in Sept. 2020, 264.877 in Mar. 2021; 1.77% so far), so that's out; I can't imagine prices going down unless some new, unexpected shock hits the US. If CPI stays close to long-term trend lines (e.g., 5-year, 10-year), then inflation would be ~2.1% to 2.4%. If CPI stays a bit below trends, then inflation could be ~2.05%, just barely inside bin 2. The analysts at the site below expect CPI to stay flat until around August and then slowly move upwards until a larger increase in early 2022. In that view, the current uptick is the result of short-term shocks, including the recent stimulus package. I can't picture any major new government spending initiative starting before Sept. 2021, either. But it's possible that food and/or energy prices could go up more than expected. I'm going to put weight on a bit more increases in costs than are forecasted below, but there's still so much economic damage to recover from that I can't picture inflation going much past 5-yr or 10-yr trends, if at all. Many seem to be forecasting high inflation based on a big spending boom, but with $1.3T transferred to the ultrawealthy in the past year and still so much to recover from, I'm not sure where all that increase in spending would be coming from. I suspect spending will shift and things will get better for a lot of people, but I don't see much inflation around the corner. In particular, I don't think the recent linear trend upward will continue much further. https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-price-index-cpi"

Hat tip to @erikbays whose comment made me rethink the numbers and run the index. Simply the index in Sept 2020 was 260.280. In march 2021 the index is at 264.897. In 2020 from april thru december the index grew 1.6% which incljdes the negative growth in April and may 2020. So it is an easy projection to say the index will grow 1.6% from now to sept 2021. This puts the index at 269.115. Then the year on year change for sept 21 is 3.4% ((Sept 21 - sept 20)/ sept 20).

To hit 3.1% the rise in the index over the next 6 months would have to be about 40% higher than the median 6 month rise, which seems plausible."

That's what Powell has said and it seems reasonable. Looking at the chart the highest inflation rate in the last 5 years is 2.9% in July 2019. So I'm keeping the chances of exceeding 3% as pretty low. But the series is also pretty noisy, so I think it's good to keep the probabilities spread out over the buckets within reason."
