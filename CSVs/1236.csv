"Before 1 January 2020, will General Motors launch a ride-hailing service open to the public in the U.S. which uses autonomous vehicles?",2018-12-14T18:00:27Z,2020-01-01T07:59:50Z,No,"['Yes, using only vehicles with steering wheels', 'Yes, using only vehicles without steering wheels', 'Yes, using at least some vehicles without steering wheels', 'No']",['Technology'],553,654,289,237,"General Motors and its subsidiary Cruise Automation have announced intentions to launch a ride-hailing service somewhere in the U.S. in 2019 (GM Authority). GM plans to use a version of the Chevy Bolt built without a steering wheel for the service (Detroit News, Driven, IEEE Spectrum). However, technical and regulatory hurdles remain (Reuters, San Francisco Chronicle). A service which requires rider prescreening or registration before use will count. A service that operates along a fixed route will not count. Confused?

It surely will take 2-3 months to hire that many staff and get them to full productivity. That leaves ~6 months to roll out the service, which is not impossible but ambitious. It's also hard to judge how far along they are right now and whether the hiring spree is an indication that they know how to push it over the finish line, or whether it is an act to compensate for lagging behind schedule."

GM CEO Mary Barra is directing the company into a path to which she believes the future will focus on, which is self-driving cars in the drive-hailing service. However, as this gets closer to becoming a reality, the issues it brings are becoming more obvious. There are policies and laws that have yet to be addressed when it comes to autonomous vehicles on the road. These cars may have difficulty accounting for certain laws of the road and for humans' improv on the road. Should a crash occur, the question of fault who come into play as one wouldn't know who to attribute the mistake too. With this, then you would have to look at whether it was the hardware or software of the autonomous car. GM must also listen to its audience; many of whom show large amounts of apprehension in placing themselves or loved ones in a car without a driver. Because of these reasons, the likelihood of GM launching an autonomous vehicle hauling service is unlikely in the time span of less than a year."
