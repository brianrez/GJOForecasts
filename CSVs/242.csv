If Spotlfy had any plans to drop him they would’ve done it when Rogan was in the red-hot seat with all the covid mis/disinformation & Ivermectin shenanigans — not now many months later during the potential soft launch of a redemption campaign with almost 1.5 years left on his reported $200m contract."

My previous rationale, giving it 25% odds, was based on Rumble's offer in the $100 million range, thinking Rogan may consider it if Spotify puts too many constraints and demands on fact checking in the production of the content. So, it could have been a matter of Rogan leaving not Spotify ending their contract. As the pandemic winds down, the controversy will lessen. And Rogan is not likely to leave given the financial benefit."

Research & future events will push that .79 forecast down (or up). The longer JR goes without one of the following events, the more-likely he is to stay at Spotify (this remain as is). What I'm watching for that would push my forecast for leaving/termination/buy-out/off spotify: 1. Public announcement of education or training 2. Suspension--it's very unlikely that Spotify would terminate Rogan before suspending him--i'd imagine there is some sort of playbook or HR guidelines they'd follow, of which suspension is a play 3. Mass drop in a. Subscribers, or b. Advertisers 4. Mass exodus in ""brand name"" artists 5. JR apologies for...anything"
