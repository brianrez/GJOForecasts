I continue to examine Turkey, which is experiencing a major surge. They have had 4.5 million COVID cases, but only 37,329 deaths from COVID. Unless Turkey has some new medical technology to respond to COVID or a genetic resilience to the virus they should have a death count significantly higher, probably above 100,000. But, the rules are the rules for these projections. I will slowly move towards 100% ""7 or 8"" over the next week."

Dentro de esta lista, hay 7 países que ya tienen más de 100.000 muertes, por lo tanto, con esta información ya se que van a haber 7 o más países. Además, el octavo país con más muertes, Francia, tiene 99.135 muertes y al día de hoy (13 de abril), sumaron 385 muertes, por lo que es muy probable que a fin de mes ya hayan superado las 100.000 muertes, teniendo así 8 países en la lista. El noveno país con más muertes por coronavirus es Alemania, que registra 78.796 muertes, habiendo sumado 296 al día de hoy. Le siguen España con 76.5255 y Colombia con 66.156 muertes. De esta forma, veo muy dificil que puedan haber 9 o más países con más de 100.000 muertes, ya que, para el caso de Alemania (que se asoma como el noveno país), si tuviera una tasa de 300 muertes diarias por 18 días, se sumarían un poco más de 5.000 muertes, haciendo imposible que se llegue a un total de 100.000.

France is a few thousand away from crossing (currently @ ~97k) and currently has a 7 day death rate average of 276, which if maintained would push it above 100k within the stated timeframe (far earlier). Given that France is going through another wave of infection, reaching this number of deaths seems all but certain given past patterns of covid surges. The countries with the next two highest death tolls - Germany @ 77k and Spain @ 75 k - would need their average death rates for the next 23 days to increase by a factor of 9.5x and 12.4x respectively to cross the 100k threshold. Given they both seem to be in transmission plateaus (new cases / capita), this appears highly unlikely.

Poland would need around 2,000 per day, a number not even reached by the UK at its peak. Germany would need the best part of 1,000 cases per day, similar to its peak. That would represent a catastrophically poor performance over the next month, especially given that vaccines have been rolled out to the most vulnerable (https://www.statista.com/statistics/1195560/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccinations-number-germany) and the weather is improving. Is there a chance that Germany or another breaks the 100,000 mark? Yes. Either by a seriously unfortunate event or, arguably more likely, a nation changes how it has counted the deaths retrospectively and the numbers jump up by a significant amount. There is a chance, but I don't see it as a 1% chance given how far into the pandemic we are and I've not heard of a single country change methods retrospectively since the UK (https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-data-idUSKBN29J2TH).

If it continues this way, Germany will probably see at most an additional number of deaths that is approximately the same as the number of deaths due to cases from Feb. 10 backwards 32 days to Jan. 9, inclusive, modified by the higher case fatality rate for B.1.1.7. With an approximately 3 week lag in deaths, this translates to the deaths from Jan. 30 through March 3. Germany added 15.0k deaths between Jan. 9 and March 3. However, B.1.1.7 is more deadly (30% to 50%?) than ancestral strains, so the deaths could be a bit higher. Note that many deaths can be expected to increase dramatically soon, because cases already went up, vaccination rates are low (albeit concentrated among seniors), and so, the deaths are already baked in. Germany's deaths currently stand at 76.1k. Even with incredible exponential growth in cases and greater case fatality rates due to B.1.1.7, it's probably not possible for Germany to reach 100k cases by April 30."

This then becomes a question of will Germany (required death rate ~540 per day, current ~200 and dropping) or Spain (rdr ~560, cdr ~100 and falling). From a quick scan, no other countries appear to threaten this threshold. The new rise in cases across central Europe (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-56340161) is a concern, eg. the deaths in Czechia are on a significant rise. However Poland would need a period not unlike the UK suffered in the first 50 days of 2021 and from a smaller population. Czechia would need to have a period worse than any seen so far, and from a far smaller population (80,000 deaths in 50 days would represent 0.8% of the total population). I am almost certain that the final number will be 7 or 8. I believe that a (possible) final assessment will be able to be made at the beginning of April."

(RU also exercises drastic underreporting, hard to tell if this will change until end of April.) Will there be a 9th? Germany is, at first sight, the obvious candidate. With, from now on, 468 deaths per day (84% of February average of 560 /d so far), GE would pass 100k on April 30. However, this is *unlikely*, due to - vaccine rollout protecting most vulnerable demographics - strict German policies - warmer season ahead So, after forecasting this question 25 times, I am resting my case today by making two predictions: 1) 7-8 countries: 100% 2) This is my last forecast for this question Of course, I might err in both points, but I feel confident with this question for the first time since October…."

The other three concerns are France, Russia and Germany. For France and Germany, their weather over the next 7/10 days will be very poor. Depending on how they count deaths, that could impact. France is holding steady and I expect the current death rate (~400 per day) to hold through February. However they only need to average under 265 per day over the full period to come under 100,000 deaths. Over the remaining 60 days of the time period that would be 223 deaths per day. Their vaccine roll out has been slow (and frankly strange at times), but they have a good chance of having low death rates in mid-late March through April. Their cases counts are not encouraging however. Requirement for weekly count at 1st March: 1800. Germany should avoid the 100,000. They are currently at ~640 deaths per day and need to average 466 per day for the entire period. On current pace Germany will be at 460 deaths per day in another ~3 weeks. Even assuming a bad February, they should be able to manage to drop below the 460 deaths per day mark by the start of March. I will be looking at the weekly figure for 1st March with interest. If it is below 3,220 then ""9 or more"" will become very unlikely. Cases also dropping. Russia is most likely of the three to break the 100,000 barrier. It has recorded ~500 deaths per day for the past 7 days. It needs to average below 285 per day for the next 83 days to fail to break 100,000. The recent week on week decrease is significant and encouraging, but of course one cannot extrapolate too much from a single weekly count. it is less distinct in the daily figures, for instance. However the case rates are falling ahead of the deaths! Their vaccines seem decent and we should expect improvement. Russia should end up very close to 100,000. 1st March crucial weekly figure: 2,000."

In light of the UK reaching the 100k mark I am updating the forecast. As of 1/29/21 there are now 5 countries with over 100k deaths. As the numbers continue to climb and vaccines role out the daily rates will have to be watched closely. Italy, France, and Russia are the next 3 countries that have the potential to reach 100k in 90 days. Italy and France are both at a rough daily rate of 300-400 deaths a day. At this rate both will exceed 100k in 90 days. Next would be Russia who's rate has been higher closer to 500 daily and will exceed 100k if this rate continues. There is still a chance to exceed 8 countries if Germany continues on its path of 700-800 daily deaths."

The UK, which seemed to have their case load under control, have seen skyrocketing numbers the last 30 days. Although their daily cases may have peaked for now, they are extremely likely to hit the 100,000 plus number in the next 30 days.

There are 3 more countries with about 50k deaths which would need to see 600 deaths per day to get to 100k by April.

While the over-80s are already being vaccinated, progress has been slow and there are still many vulnerable people who will already be infected and are likely to die over the next couple of months, with more in their 70s, 60s and 50s to follow as time grinds on.

Deaths from the second wave are still materialising, but in just over two months we've lost another 20,000. Deaths from the second wave are building at a slower rate, likely due to improved treatments and lower viral loads due to social distancing and mask wearing, however covid's long tail and scenes of packed streets full of maskless, non distancing shoppers + a Christmas the public are being encouraged to celebrate mean more 2nd wave deaths & a third wave incoming, irrespective of the vaccine which, for many vulnerable people won't be rolled out until next year. Vaccine prioritisation also means that while surviving over-80s and the medically vulnerable might be safe by March or April, people between 50 and 80 will remain exposed to infection via education & economic policies. Italy is in a similar situation but with an older population, a big cultural emphasis on Christmas and no prospect of vaccinations until next Spring. Iran appears to be at the tail end of a massive spike from which deaths may not yet have fully materialised, and is alleging that the US are blocking their access to a vaccine. Whether this is true or not, no vaccine = no vaccine. News story this week showed Turkish hospitals struggling to cope with admissions. Better knowledge of prevention and treatment may stop some of these countries hitting 100k by April 30th, but I'd be surprised if the virus's preference for low temperatures, greater indoor activity, Christmas, anti-vax and anti-lockdown efforts didn't result in at least one or two more countries breaching the third bin."

The question becomes from the surging countries that could hit the mark in 187 days as of this writing. UK, Argentina, Iran, and possibly Peru or Colombia. The UK showed a high death to case ratio early in the outbreak, but clearly normalized. So given the new spike in cases, its questionable that the fatality rate will follow in step. If we make a rough estimate that around 4 million cases is needed to get 100k deaths, the question becomes whether UK will 4.6x cases in 187 days. Given the controls and better understanding today, the odds feel low. Argentina has recently hit 1MM cases, and the path to 4MM seems like it will likely miss the target date. Comparing it to Brazil which took 87 days to move to get to 1MM cases, while Argentina took 202 days. Their pace is 2.3x slower. Expanding to 4MM took brazil 73 days, so making the relative comparison would put Argentina at ~168 days to hit 4MM. Given that it feels we are seeing worldwide decrease in fatality rate it leans toward to NOT reaching 100k deaths for the target date. The rest: Iran, Peru, France, Spain, Colombia, etc there is always a faint chance of acceleration, as with any other country below them."

Ditto China. Other than a seismic political change in either nation that is likely to remain true until April. And other nations with large populations either have poor quality health care systems that will under-report (Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan etc.) or superb systems that have handled the pandemic very well (Japan, Germany). A medium-sized nation could lose control of their outbreak, but that does not necessarily mean deaths will again increase at the same rate. With the medical knowledge gained this year, second wave death rates in Europe are not (so far) spiking as high as in, for example, Italy in March-April. My stand-out concern is Argentina.
