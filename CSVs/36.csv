Both Tim Murphy for Harvard and Tony Reno for Yale have been head coaches for a while now with Tim starting this year as the best-winning coach in the Ivy League of all time.

In the three games they played the same team thus far, Harvard has a total point differential of +14 and Yale of +8.

I believe a pitfall will be looking too deeply at historical trends. Harvard won last year at Yale (this year Harvard has home field advantage), but the win was only by three points. The 2020 game was cancelled due to COVID. Yale won in 2019 in two overtimes. Implication: These results are nearly even.Expert Analysis: Most betting sites I read gave a slight edge to Harvard.Home Field Advantage: The game will be played at Harvard, and this research (and others) demonstrates that the phenomenon of “home field advantage” is scientifically and statistically grounded: https://www.chicagobooth.edu/review/home-field-advantage-facts-and-fiction. But it also indicates that people tend to overstate how much it matters – it provides a slight advantage.Conclusion: It’s sports – anything can happen. That’s why we love sports. The two seem pretty evenly matched.

A quick review of the 2022 season (as of Oct 20) shows that Harvard has won 4 of 5 games (80%), and Yale 6 of 10 games (60%). There are also two different sports forecasters who put Harvard ahead in the whole season of yale (https://theanalyst.com/na/2022/08/fcs-college-football-preview-ivy-league/ and https://www.ctinsider.com/sports/article/Yale-football-picked-fourth-in-Ivy-League-17359184.php). Based on this, I’m updating the base rate to having a higher percentage of a Harvard win."

107504,2022-10-24T17:17:01Z,1,[60.0],[60.0],"While Yale historically has won more games against Harvard, they are currently ranked lower than Harvard in the Ivy League conference (Harvard is 3rd; Yale is 4th) and are coming off a very mediocre 2021 season (5-5). I think the game is essentially a toss-up though because both schools have a 2-1 record right now, but I’ll give Harvard the edge because of the conference ranking."
