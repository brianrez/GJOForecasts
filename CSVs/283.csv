The '98 crisis kept inflation elevated for about 6 months. The '14-'16 crisis kept inflation high for about a year and a half before ""normalization"" (which was different in both cases). Puts and takes from each crisis (lot of similarities to '14-'16 less oil prices more firm now and seems US will be less likely to weigh on it so quickly). On the other hand I think sanctions are much harder on Russia now. I'll call it a wash. On average it seems inflation can stay elevated for over a year which suggests we stay >9% for longer. But I will leave some room for lower given base effects, removal of sanctions, and given the higher energy prices now."

So I have a tough time seeing this persistent level of inflation allt he way through to September and have to suspect a mean-reversion -- either because of a descalation of tensions (helps alleviate pressure on the rouble) or an easing of global supply issues (deflationary), or given the aggressive policy action by the Russian central bank (more here: https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/russia-to-hike-rates-by-100-bps-in-feb-as-ukraine-tensions-inflation-bite).

So I'll say 6.5-7% is a more reasonable average. So that will be my starting point and i'll put 50/50 in Bucket 3 / 4 because of that -- purely mean reversion. But let's dig into it a bit more: 1) Inflationary pressures are certainly the topic of every economy right now -- be it on the energy side, supply chains, or worker shortages. So I do think ""above average"" or ""above central bank target inflation"" is fair. That said, I have a feeling in the back half of the year the supply chain / worker issues will resolve. 2) CBR's target inflation rate is 4% and it appears the CBR+Putin admin is very focused on getting inflation in check -- they are keen to use rates to attack the issue -- in fact it's believed the central bank chair is one of the most aggressive in terms of using rates (https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/12/08/russias-inflation-surges-once-more-central-bank-poised-for-rate-hike-a75771). Further, having the Putin admin focused on the issue helps as well. 3) With all of that said, the CBR's own officials concede ""Zabotkin warned Wednesday that inflation will remain significantly above the target for most of next year, with substantial declines possible only in the fourth quarter"" (https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/russia-signals-bigger-rate-hike-next-week-as-inflation-rises-1.1692784) -- but what does ""significantly mean? I'll take the 4% and push it to the low-end of our average range above ""6.5-7%"" Now I'm at 60/40 between Bucket 3 & 4 4) I do believe there is a chance we have a quicker resolution to these inflation fears (supply chains, energy, etc) and if the central bank tightens as aggressively as it appears they may I believe there is a chance they get ahead of the curve and stifle inflation back to tagret (4%). So I must add to bucket 2. 5) Given inflation has only surpassed 9% during financial crises, I will leave that as a fat-tailed event and only apply a few percentage points. Same goes for <3% which did happen pre-COVID but I give little chance of that return."
