This is in line with China’s policy of aligning their military spending allocations to the country’s economic growth (GDP). This has been about 1.889% of GDP in recent years. Growth was severely affected by the Covid pandemic that produced a growth rate of 2.27% and therefore limited their military budget for that year. Estimates for 2021 growth are 8.4% as China’s economy boosts from the pandemic turndown. China has increased its military budget 6.8% in 2021 but this in the light of the extensive growth rate of this year. In 2019 their defence budget was increased by 7.5% with a lower GDP growth of 5.82%. Therefore, given a fairly modest increase 6.8% of military spending in 2021 compared to the economic growth of the country (estimated 8.4%), the percentage of GDP planned for military spending could perhaps be equal or less than 2019."

That means official forecast is ~1.26% of GDP, SIPRI has 1.7% for 2019, which I thought seemed really far off until I saw the CSIS breakdown (https://www.csis.org/analysis/understanding-chinas-2021-defense-budget) which says ""SIPRI estimated that Chinese defense-related expenditure actually reached $240 billion in 2019—nearly 40 percent higher than the official budget ($183.5 billion)."" So the 209.2 could really be 292.9 BN USD, meaning the real number could be ~1.76% of GDP. It seems that 40% extra is pretty consistent in SIPRI's estimations. So, we've got 2 variables... how much above the official numbers will SIPRI state actual spending to be?... and what will actual GDP growth be?... For the statement to hold true if we assume GDP estimates track SIPRI would need to believe real numbers are 35% or more above reported... which seems likely given past reports Or, GDP numbers could go higher than forecast, which also seems possible given the variability of forecasts over the last few months. I'm reasonably confident they won't spend less on the military so am essentially ruling that out. All said, it seems more likely than not but will need to re-evaluate as gdp estimates are revised.

So on this basis alone the 2021 expenditure are likely to be above 1.89% and to revert to the mean of 1.91%. However GDP growth in 2021 could be higher than in 2019 as the Chinese economy recovers from the pandemic. The risk to GDP growth is to the upside rather than downside from what we know now. I have done rough calculations based on SIRPI numbers to determine how sensitive military expenditures as a share of GDP to a 1% change in GDP. The ratio of 5 to 1, i.e. a 1% increase in GDP will reduce military expenditure as a % of GDP by 0.2%, keeping the USD number of military expenditures constant. In 2019 GDP growth was 6% and if this year it will be 7% then assuming mean reversion to 1.91% of military spending to GDP, we need to adjust it lower by 0.2% to 1.89%. This is also assuming that China will stick to the same logic of military spending as they did in previous years and will not decide to boost or reduce for some geopolitical or domestic reasons. Therefore the answer then narrows down to: will China's GDP growth is going to be above or below 7% in 2021? This is a close call at this stage. I think that the GDP growth will print the growth rate between 6 and 7% in 2021. Thus military spending should be between 1.89% and 1.91%, so probably higher in 2021 than in 2019."

From the SIPRI spreadsheet, using the constant USD figures and calculating the increase on previous year, military spending increases only exceeds this in one of the last 10 years (a fair cut off, I think, after the defence boom '90s) and the average was 6.4%. However, we also need to factor in that China's 2020 GDP growth in real terms was estimated at only 1.9%. Assuming that defence spending continued with no significant hiccup from COVID (lower activity levels are possibly a saving?) and grew at 5%, the economy would be at 101.9% in 2020 but defence spending would be at 105%. Then in 2021, economy would be at 110.15%, but defence spending would be at 110.25% of 2019 levels (i.e. just higher in relative terms). This implies that with these assumptions, the figure *will* increase if defence spending growth continues at 5% through 2021. But unless I'm missing something (quite possible!) it's very very close. I think the ongoing geopolitical competition with the US, irrespective of the Biden presidency, will push Chinese defence spending up, if anything. So that nudges my upwards a bit."

Thanks to the efforts of over half-dozen thinkers and researchers I now think I know something and will alter my forecast. The answer to this question is only as good as the data provided, which many have pointed out is difficult to find. While spending will most likely increase, so will the GDP on which the reported number is based. Given that these data are not audited, the status quo reported numbers would appear best to not raise alarm elsewhere. Thus I will scale my forecast to anticipate the reported percentage, which is likely to be similar to recent numbers to avoid concern by others."

India’s paramilitary forces, which make up the Central Armed Police Forces, fall under the Ministry of Home Affairs, not the Ministry of Defense. India is also not forthcoming about space and nuclear weapons expenditures. The United States funds its nuclear weapons through the Department of Energy and does not include these details in its defense budget. However, the US government maintains a high level of budgetary transparency, which enables analysts to readily account for discrepancies From you previously: https://chinapower.csis.org/military-spending/"
