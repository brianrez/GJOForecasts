The various factions are not agreement as to the Electoral law and the methods of representation by changing from proportional representation to individual selection and also to avoid the accusation of vote rigging in the last election where there are calls to handle corruption issues before a new election may be set. Due to the slump in the Oil Price, Iraq’s main source (90%) of government revenue has diminished (65% of GDP) and the onset of coronavirus has exacerbated the economic situation with the addition of terrorism form Islamic State (IS). Unemployment is rife and public services lacking suggesting that structural issues have to be confronted before divisive elections should be held. The country does not have its constitution in place to to hold elections and the country can ill-afford to hold them now. Even though Al-Kadhimi has announced early elections to be his top priority, his government will have to address the economic problems before the country considers a new administration."
