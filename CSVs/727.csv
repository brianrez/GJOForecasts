But it seems they are more interested in the ride hailing market initially before pursuing the automatic delivery opportunity. Following is an excerpt from the interview with the current CTO, and cofounder When we first started talking to Amazon, we had the same thought you did: This is a company that moves a lot of stuff around, and that they'd probably be interested in moving around autonomously. It's a good idea! And it's not that they're not interested in that. They are interested in that. But to their immense credit, when we started talking to them last year, they actually got even more excited about what we're already doing, which is an entirely new market for them. https://www.protocol.com/zoox-self-driving-car"

Also, for ride-hailing, they just need someone (does it need to be outside Amazon even?) to take a ride on these streets they have received a permit for. I am not sure the permit allows passengers though. Regardless, they will very likely first deliver a package. It is therefore much more likely that they will both deliver a package and perform ride-hailing, than just ride-hailing alone. I updated the forecast to take all this into account."

There will be select locations in the US where ride-hailing will be permitted. But, given the haphazard nature of most areas of the US, the most likely use of Zoox is for last mile delivery from regional Amazon warehouses to Google GPS-mapped locations (ie, fleet management). They may also deploy their in house fleet management infrastructure as an enterprise product (using the same strategic philosophy that launched AWS. Although it's not a forecastable option here, I think municipal or private campus shuttles and buses may be more likely than ride-hailing applications. Especially in Amazon owned locations."

Zoox has received a permit to test on some public roads with no driver. According to the permit requirements that means they must have an SAE level 4 or 5 vehicle which means they're pretty far along. It seems pretty likely to me that they would want to get a program going like Waymo has and that they're capable of it within the next 2 years. Carrying a package I would guess would be the simplest target because you can have a company employee ride along and do the actual delivering. But I'd guess they would aim for a taxi service for the public or members like Waymo is doing. And if they can carry humans it seems absurd that a company owned by Amazon would not use it to deliver a package at least once for PR.
