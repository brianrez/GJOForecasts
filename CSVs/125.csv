Ferrari has signaled no plans to change or improve their current methods. Mercedes is looking better, but it's unclear that their improvements will continue far and quickly enough to overtake the Red Bull's performance in time for one of their drivers to take the title off Verstappen. I suspect it's more likely that Mercedes' improvements will leave them racing with Ferrari behind Red Bull, further hurting Ferrari's chances. While there exists a world where Red Bull thoroughly beefs it and has severe maintenance or strategy issues for the rest of the season, it is more likely that the team would fight and improve their way out of the situation than be left behind by the other teams for the rest of the season."
