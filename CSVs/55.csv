Because of the outcome of election at Italy, I assume, that EU and especially ECB will run into higher trouble as up to now. My personal view is that woman act often with higher amount of emotions in decision making. Italy, EU and ECB are being lead by woman. The ECB has introduced the PIP program, which allows the ECB by political evaluations to do state supporting purchases of Bonds. The ECB has bought over last weeks for 10 billion Euro Bonds of Italy to reduce the spread to German Bonds. That is from my point view political motivated than justified by financial evaluations. I think, the capabilities is low to do the job of head of EU and head of ECB. The ECB is behind the curve to increase interest rate up to now. Italian election outcome will reduce energy and speed to fight aggressive against inflation. These moments weaken the Euro stronger for longer than cause the opposite."

Since hitting parity in July, the euro has decreased in value, currently at 0.9847 to the dollar. In the last five days, the Euro has fluctuated up and down between slightly over 1 to below 1.

October 7 is 18 days away, meaning there is time for potentially significant adjustment. The euro has not sustained below 1 USD since 2000/2001. In the next 18 days, the energy crisis will continue and price pressure will on consumers and businesses will sustain or grow. The European countries are also figuring out their winter energy plans, which may include shutting down some industry which would potentially weaken the Euro. Thus I'll say that it will likely be lower than 1 USD by Oct 7, though with low confidence."

The weather won't change too much in the next two weeks but increased uncertainty in the Ukraine-Russia conflict has my initial forecast as more likely for Euro to US exchange rate to be less than 1."

The Euro has been steadily declining across 2022, and high energy costs + rising inflation has only exacerbated this. With the US' rising interest rates, it puts even more stress and pressure on the exchange rate and value of the euro. However, the euro keeps rising and dipping at a unique rate. With Liz Truss in the UK now, her policies promote lowering energy costs and lowering inflation rates, which would help the exchange rate. In addition, with the war in Ukraine seemingly slowing down, gas prices are lowering at a gradual rate again. None of this seems like it will have an IMMEDIATE impact in 3 weeks. The price of the euro is unpredictable, but based on previous trends, I predict that the Euro will stay about 1.00 USD in the exchange rate. In 2-3 months, the euro exchange rate would be extremely interesting due to the volatility of the euro right now."

Then I looked at the exchange rate over the past year. A year ago the exchange rate was $1. 16. There has been a steady decrease. Therefore with a steady decrease, I think that those days that were $1.01 have a good chance in a few weeks of being $1.00.

The general EU stance has been stubborn rhetoric but not forceful or meaningful resistance to the Russian strong arm tactic to choke off a large part of its current energy supply. In fact, it incredibly doubled-down with several of the member states forcing in green energy policies to eliminate other alternatives to maintain energy levels at cost. The demand will increase, the price will skyrocket and the middle class and business sectors will be devastated across many of the EU nation states thru the next year barring a massive shift in policy and trade. The question is, do they follow Sweden and begin to rethink these plans or Germany and lean in hard for a harsh winter and near future with energy shortfalls while having to play Russia's games to beg for a Nord Stream flow return at sever trade / dollar disadvantage? Does this value effect the worth and breath of the EURO more than the issue of US inflation on the Dollar (and the rapid de-pinning of the dollar to international oil trade with Russia/China)...yea I think it does. Europe is experiences inflation rise as well, and frankly both sets of values will likely be more closely related to the energy supply issues in the next 2 years and until the US dollar is completely out of the global trade game, that will keep the Dollar buoyed to a more relative line than the EURO thru an energy crisis."
