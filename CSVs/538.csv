We're sitting at 13 weeks on the best seller list with 4 chances left. According to my modeling, Think Again is on a downward trajectory, but has a standard deviation of about 6 ranking spots. This means, to appear on the list next week, it would have to be about 1 standard deviation above my model's expectation. I estimate this to be about a 15% chance. If this does not happen it then has three remaining chances each with diminishing probability. When I calculated it out, it came to about a 68%, but I made a lot of assumptions that could be wrong, so I'll bias toward the crowd.

First point is that it's pretty rare for a book to be on the list for 14-18 weeks. Since August 23, 22 books have been on the list at least once whose total number of weeks is >8 (and aren't on the current list). 8 have totaled 9-13 weeks, 12 have totaled 18+ weeks, but only two hit 14-18. Both of the books that hit 14-18 were from entries at rank 13-15, one for 1 week at rank 14 and one for 3 weeks at 15-13-15. The 9-13 books simply fell off the list at an average of rank 12. It seems like hitting the 14-18 bucket is mostly whether you luck into a couple extra lowest-rank weeks, which most books didn't do. The downward trajectory of Think Again is a bit too steep to justify a strong 18+ prediction, so a decent outside rate, admittedly based off of only 10 books, would be 80% 9-13 and 20% 14-18."

That seems to be dispersed mostly around 9-12 (row 2) or closer to 15-20 (row 1). Taking a middle ground (12-16) and subtracting 2 weeks, 10-14.
