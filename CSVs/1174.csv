The project received zero attention in the Danish election campaign (which perhaps was expected), but it underlines that it is not a currently a major political case in Denmark. I suspect Denmark will continue it's route of 'avoidance' and push the decision as far as it can - hoping it will become an EU decision.

The relationship with US is the center of Denmark's hesitancy to approve the project, as the US has long been Denmark's closest international ally. In proposing, and potentially approving such a bill, US lawmakers are underlining their opposition to the project and the political importance of it. Consequently, DK would have a hard time approving a project that an ally is sanctioning. This development only supports the hypothesis that Denmark will delay their decision even further.

With that being said, the people behind the Russian company that is currently constructing the pipeline have critiqued Danish politicians for not taking a decision, as the pipeline is fast approaching Bornholm, which could speed up the process. On the other hand, one must believe that the coming election will influence the choice, both the EU election and the Danish parliamentary elections. Some Danish politicians have expressed worries that the pipeline will undermine the EU's energy strategy, as well as the fact that Russia will use the pipeline to put pressure on other European states, and state that Russia has shown willingness to do this before.

It is believed by number of east European, Nordic and Baltic Sea countries that the Nord Stream 2 will increase EU dependence/resilience on Moscow. The major concerns that occurred over the past few years are: (1) the route will double the amount of Russian gas delivered to Germany through the Baltic States; (2) will “make little commercial sense”; and (3) will lead to “exert energy leverage over Western Europe” for Putin. In the beginning the European Commission, the Baltic States and Poland as well joined the United States in opposing to the idea of the pipeline. However, Finland, Sweden and Germany have already approved the construction of the pipeline. Therefore, the Danish refusal is a major challenge for the Gazprom project. Besides, in February 2019, the EU allowed the project to be proceeded, a deal that was compromising the positions of different states was introduced by Germany and France. The pipeline must meet several EU requirements and the process is going to be led by Germany."

Denmark doesn't want to antagonize superpowers as the US, so much against the NS2, plus, has submitted an application for a third route option for the pipeline: this act it's a strategy to postpone further the construction of the NS2. In spiete its will Denmark has not many tools to use. Indeed, ""Denmark still has the possibility to veto the initial route option after it passed a law in 2017 that could allow it to ban the pipeline from passing through its territorial waters on security grounds.

As harsh as it sounds, successfully implemented NordStream 2 would become a highly powerful tool in Putin's hands to do the impact on European decisions. In addition, this project goes against Europe's energy policy in terms of diversification of the energy sources and of transit countries within the EU itself (with the Nord Stream II pipeline, Russia would export even more towards the EU and Germany would acquire a predominant position as a point of entry of natural gas (30% of gas would be arriving in the EU via Germany, an increase from the current figure of 15%).

Given that we are less than a month out from June 1, that Denmark will overcome this reluctance and suddenly approve construction is not foreseeable. Option1 is forecasted at 0%. As discussed in my original forecast on this question, ultimately Denmark will not have any decision-making power on a pipeline that does not go through it's territorial waters but will attempt to delay as long as possible. Since the pipeline is due to be complete at the end of the year, Denmark's approval will likely come as late as they possibly can make it -- after September. Nord Stream 2 has already said that it is on track, though Danish actions may push the completion date back. How long of a delay Denmark can create will determine when it's approval finally comes through. Equal weighting is given to each timeframe after September, accounting for their wish to postpone further on the one hand (giving an after December 1 approval) and their lack of veto power to really do anything about it on the other (giving a between September 1 and November 30 approval)."

Therefore, it does make political sense for Denmark to approve the pipeline before June 2019. For this reason I think there is a 0% chance of that happening. Moreover, after the election, any new government would have to form a new cabinet and take time to transition to leadership and making a decision on Nord Stream 2 so early on has the potential to undermine the authority of the Danish government in the eyes of their voters. Therefore, I find it highly unlikely that it'll be approved soon after elections.

For this reason, I'm skeptical also about the idea of approving it in the months following the election, which will be a government transition period. - in the end of 2018 Denmark has put an end to the dispute with Poland about the maritime borders in the Baltic Sea: this has allowed Danish Emergency Agency to ask for an evaluation of the eventual environmental risks caused by the pipeline. We should remember Denmark is very concerned about environmental issues - EU is also skeptical for multiple reasons: it doesn’t want to rely on Russia dependency on gas, in particular now that the sanctions are still active and because of the unresolved dispute in Crimea. Moreover, EU has recently changed the project, and now it’s under the European Law. Also, for EU this stream represents an energy security issue, because Gazprom has the monopole of the pipeline. - EU is already building the TAP (trans Adriatic pipeline), in order to diversify gas supplies importing it from Azerbaijan. I don’t see a lot of coherence in implementing a project as Nord Stream 2, with the opposite effect of relying on Russian supplies. - Russia has launched an alternative to bypass Denmark, focusing on the Balcan route and export gas through those countries - Among the ""against Nord stream 2"" there are US, Baltic countries and Poland, all of them worried about the rely of Europe on Russian gas. US is an historical competitor of Russia in the economic military and political fields, while Poland and Baltic states have historically been scared and threatened by the power of Russia, so their rejection is due to this fear"

The pipeline will make it possible for more gas to be transported from Russia to Germany, which is thus trying to exercise pressure on Denmark to allow the construction. On the other side, the USA are opposing the project and do not want the traditional routes via Ukraine to be bypassed. Austrian energy group OMV , one of the companies that is financing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, is optimistic Denmark will approve the project this year and the new gas transport route will start operations late 2019 (https://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFL8N1XB68G). Similarly, according to the European Commissioner for Budget and Human Resources Günther Hermann Oettinger, ""the pipeline has been under construction for a long time and may not be halted so easily anymore"" (https://polandin.com/40640045/nord-stream-2-cannot-be-stopped-now-eu-commissioner). In my opinion therefore, it is likely that the final approval will arrive in the second half of the year, once a new government will be formed, and with no further delay."

Thus far it has been delaying the approval, and has implemented laws allowing it to refuse the the pipeline on a security basis — this can be seen as a strategic move, as the pipeline has faced opposition from the US (an important economic partner to Denmark). With or without Danish permits though, the project was never going to be derailed since its EEZ is effectively governed by international laws."

The Danish government is the last one, whose approval is still pending. That the project has not proved very popular with the Danish government becomes clear by looking at the approval process to date. Only after Nord Stream 2 submitted its application, the Danish parliament passed the amendment of the Continental Shelf Act (01/01/2018), which enables the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs to veto infrastructure projects handled by the Danish Energy Agency (DEA) in case they run contrary to Danish security interests (https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/mecklenburg-vorpommern/Nord-Stream-2-Daenemark-lehnt-geplante-Route-ab,nordstream302.html). Predicting a possible negative outcome, Nord Stream 2 AG proposed an alternative route - 36 km longer than the original one - but outside of Danish territorial waters, only running through its exclusive economic zone (EEZ). This route can only be prevented/delayed by serious safety or logistical concerns - not political ones. It is considered highly unlikely Denmark would risk rejecting a project in its EEZ for obvious political reasons, given that it has historically relied so heavily on commerce from its important trading route waters. The government would risk being seen as an untrustworthy maritime operator (https://www.forbes.com/sites/davekeating/2018/09/05/as-of-today-russias-controversial-nord-stream-2-pipeline-is-already-underwater/)."

If Rasmussen was expecting the UE to back up on the motives not to approve Nord Stream 2, Denmark can no longer refuse the route to go through Danish waters as the Union has just declared that it won’t block the project (https://politiken.dk/udland/art7031352/Nord-Stream-2-gasledningen-får-grønt-lys-fra-EU). The construction of the pipeline is in process and I expect the works to arrive near Denmark in the following months (mid-summer). In that sense, I expect Denmark not to make a decision before the works come to proximity but in late July-August. In additon, I believe that for economic interests; because the UE is not much willing to hinder the project; and because the German-Russian project will go through Danish waters anyways (using the alternative of EEZ), it is most likely that Denmark will approve the construction of Nord Stream 2 through its territorial waters. If it is still possible that the works arrive in Denmark’s waters at the end of the Summer because of further potential delay, it is most likely that the decision will be made during September/early October, not later."

If Russian, German and Gazprom's lobbying will be succesful, it will require time, and a careful bargaining over Denamrk's interests. I think the most likely outcome will be an impatient Gazprom tired of waiting and eventually deciding to adopt the more costly, but possibly time efficient plan B avoiding Denmark's exclusive economic zone - the fact that there is a plan B could be a bargaining device to speed up Denamrk's decision-making or an actual sign that the project will be done without Copenhagen's approval."

Concerned by geopolitical reasons, especially with Russia, Denmark rejects the project, seeing a political negative impact rather than an economic benefit, as see Germany. Gazprom, the Russian company that is driving the project, has already applied for the first pipeline route in April 2017. Nevertheless, Denmark has made a wait-and-see attitude, asking for a greater examination of the environmental impacts, through an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Nord Stream 2 to counter this voluntary delay submitted on August 10, 2018 a second building permit, allocated with an EIA, for an alternative route in the northwest of Bornholm, this time. This second request is different than the first one, as the second route passes through Denmark's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), where its jurisdiction is severely diminished, unlike the first route through the Danish territorial waters. This second route is only 36km longer than the first, which is not a major obstacle, and Denmark would not be able to block it anymore. In addition, work on the pipeline has already begun, and the closer they get to Denmark, the sooner the construction agreement, whether in its territorial waters or in the EEZ, will be felt. Denmark is going to decided very soon between the two projects, due to the arrival of the pipeline near its waters, and can not therefore refuse an agreement, because the second alternative will be done automatically if the first route is not accepted, and Denmark will therefore lose economic profits due to a excessive wait-and-see attitude. In addition, it should be noted that the Nord Stream 1 project was approved in the Danish waters and is still in service, which strengthens the chances of an agreement in 2019, because the geopolitical consequences in the case of a bad scenario will be there anyway. Secondly, the EIA for the alternative route has shown that the pipeline would have a minor, negligible, and not significant effect for the environment, but also for tourism and even military practices. There is no impact at all. (Source: https: //ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/OlieGas/11_-_environmental_impact_assessment_denmark._nord_stream_2_-_north-western_route._august_2018.pdf). I believe that the construction of the pipeline will reach Danish waters between July and September 2019, and that a response will be made right after this arrival or by the end of 2019 at the latest."
