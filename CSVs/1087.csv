All will but the timing of this question makes the precise timing unascertainable. As of now 18 of 20 appeared at the labor union forum.All are scheduled to appear at all upcoming events in Iowa and New Hampshire. Now we have 3 mass shootings in a week including one 8 blocks from my office at the Gilroy Garlic Festival. Media coverage is 24/7 and all but Sestak no name, have all been given free appearances on Democratic TV (MSNBC) and CNN (Fake News). Even Williamson who would be more likely to be at a seance,seminar,or paid speech or ministering to Oprah, was given 5 minutes of fame by Anderson Cooper and the subject of a glowing article by David Brooks. Truly with ubiquitous media coverage and little to cover in August,all have access to the bully pulpit. Then an entirely predictable series of mass murders gives them all something intensely passionate to talk about and the media to cover at least for a month,maybe 2 weeks,see Newtown. Then Iowa and New Hampshire are like rotten boroughs, small, extremely idiosyncratic, with a sometimes roulette result. Who ever heard of Jimmy Carter,Howard Dean, and Eugene McCarthy or Pat Buchanan before these events which have an outsized influence and any candidate can catch fire and win becoming Frontrunner. The winner in Iowa wins the nomination since Carter. Fly too close to the sun like Icarus and Howard Dean you scream and plummet like a rock. Frankly,I blame Tom Perez and the DNC for this roulette and circular firing squad. Just like Presidency we have 50 different elections to get into the Superbowl and it's almost like a lottery.

Inslee and Bullock have incentives to stay in (Inslee needs to keep pushing on climate to maybe become energy secretary, Bullock appealed to some voters in the second debate and is well received in Iowa) and not many to leave. Hickenlooper could run for senate, and doesn't have much left for him in the race. Tim Ryan will probably want to run for his house seat again. Delaney, Gillibrand, Williamson, De Blasio, and Bennet all lack clear incentives to leave the race this early, but also could leave because of exhaustion and the perceived futility of their run (depending on the candidate)."
