I predicted that ISIS could hold US and Raqqa hostage if they blew that dam during investment and siege operations 200,000 lives could be lost if getting into Raqqa means letting 70 isis dudes ( real bad hombres) escape and we secure the dam and prevent q flood of biblical proportions along Euphrates...worth it. I was too critical. I know what control of Taqba is worth 300,000 lives the goal is to extirpate ISIS Afghan-Iraq and Libya the incident is consistent the decision here correct. trade 70 bad hombres for the lives 400,000 civilians. Those 70 bad hombres were positioned,tasked and armed with heavy weapons to blow dam cover for retreat of ISI leadership and wives east to Desert to Deire where ISIS command wives been headed."

The Trump administration is supplying the Kurds with weapons to reclaim Raqqa. The Kurds alone have a strong reputation as soldiers. Supplying the Kurds has caused geopolitical tension between Turkey and the US due to the close proximity of the Kurdish lands to Turkish lands and supplementing Kurdish arms caches. All sides of the civil and proxy war, except ISIS, prefer Raqqa to fall as soon as possible to relieve regional tensions. The Kurds are the best option to retake Raqqa and after they are victorious they pledged to return the city to Syrian Arabs after victory. We will see how that goes, but regardless of who ends up in the fray, I believe anti-ISIS forces will retake Raqqa before the June 1, 2017."

Turkey announced, the end of Euphrates shield. www.bbc.com US forces advance SDF Kurd forces and capture Taqba, the key to the dam and Raqqa. www,bbc.com Panic sets in and IS wifes depart to the desert. www.wsj.com Slow and steady progress and the departure of the Turks mean that its the beginning of the end of ISIS caliphate, matter of months both in Mosul and Raqqa. I agree with those who are at 99% for superforecasting purposes. There is a 1/100 chance ISIS does not mount Mosul defense in Raqqa. Raqqa is much smaller. Earlier estimates were November. Whatever the cyber-attacks on US and investigations. US military has the plans, the institutional power, and will terminate the Caliphate in Mosul and Raqqa. Its the political and diplomatic and sovereignty issues that are the real issue. and the real problem. It appears that the US is attempting to break that continuous ""shiite crescent"" that allows Tehran to supply and support its proxies in Assad and Hezbollah and will tacitly accept Assad. Lot of work Troops on the ground in the line of fire. from western media aside from BBC and WSJ CNN you would not know that there is a serious war and many lives at stake."

The Syrian army is busy elsewhere and needs ISIS to remain to justify its actions elsewhere in Syria. The Russian are unlikely to want to commit a large land army. I doubt that Russia or Syria would be happy for for Turkey to fight a war against ISIS in Syria while being against Assad, especially as the Turkish plan calls for most of the fighting to be done by Sunni rebel groups, supported by Turkey and the US. The US considers the only effective rebel fighting force that could be used against Raqqa are the Kurds, and for the US and Turkey to attack Raqqa (or support Sunni fighters against Raqqa ) requires the cooperation of the Kurds, which Turkey (with its historical animosity towards the Kurds) is not willing to agree to. The US is (presumably) unwilling to commit large numbers of ground troops to attacK Raqqa, and it has no international mandate to invade part of Syria. Like many of the world's (and USA's) problems its easier to say what needs to be done, than to figure out how to go about doing it. I seem to remember we were promised a plan to defeat ISIS within 30 days of the inauguration. That fine tuned machine that is the Trump administration will presumably be presenting the plan very, very soon (or maybe it will remain secret and we will wake up one morning to a Tweet that ISIS is no more)."

However Russia says it is scaling back in Syria (and attacks on IS were not the Russian or Syrian priority). IS is still not the top priority of Turkey which is still sees the Kurdish YPG as the enemy. IS and the YPG are fighting each other. The fighting to take Aleppo took years, and months even after Russia added its weight. The US is still involved in taking Mosul. So a fully concentrated action against Raqqa could easily be at least another 3 months away and then it might take another 3 months to take it. Taking Raqqa could be delayed so that it can be fitted into a narrative that aims to show how beneficial a US/Russia axis of power would be in the middle east. In this story a meeting between Trump and Putin would come up with a plan to destroy IS together. For this to come to pass Raqqa needs to be left to simmer on the back burner until Trump and Putin can get together,"

Indeed, they now control a few major cities and have the luxury of consolidating the gains they have made. But the conflict will not end, at least not in 2017. The loyalists are simply pulled in too many directions to achieve a decisive victory. In addition to holding their territory in the north, they must now try to clear the rebels located between Aleppo and Damascus and around Damascus itself. They will also be drawn to areas held by the Islamic State in the eastern city of Deir el-Zour, where their comrades are currently besieged. Retaking territory in the energy belt around Palmyra will be a priority too.

There was a terrorist assault on nightclub in Istanbul. 29 people were killed. Club is known to be frequented by Westerners and let assume ISIS either inspired or directed the assault. ISIS claimed responsbility. WIth a coup, and assasination, an airport bombing and numerous terror attacks along the border there have been 20 such incidents-mass casualty of 5 or more there have been over 21 in last 2 years all or most were claimed by Erdogan to be Kurd or ISIS inspired. Every attack on the border or outside Diyankibur province (where a PKK war is ongoing with Erdogan) has been inspired. I am inclined to believe that only assualts in DIiyankbir provoice where a NATO air base is located were Kurd related,. We do not know whether the assasination of the Russian ambassador or other attacks, (other than Istnabul airprot were ISIS The assasination and coup and repression and purge of over 25,000 miltiary, police, media, teachers allged Gulenists have nothing to do with ISIS."

Nothing is mentioned regarding ISIS fight except that ""terrorists"" are excluded from the cease fire. Iran has not signed off, the Kurds and YPG are sure to oppose and the position of the New Trump administration is unknown. Like all prior ceasefires this one may be made to be broken. I quote the article extensively as this is relevant to all Syria and Assad IFP. My reasoning is that lack of a buy-in by YPG and US is likely to lead to paralysis in the short run. and any military action is likely to be limited to AlBab, not ISIS. Sweeping Kurds from Turk border in Euphrates Shield is priority for Erdogan, not Raqqa. The YPG will not be leading the assault on Raqqa, a Sunni arab city while fighting Turkey and its proxy Free Syrian army. SO the forces have still not been assembled,time is running out for POTUS and President Trump's first foreign policy decisons will be use of US ground forces. Under any scenario I reaffirm 0 on this IFP and Assad stays. UN elections, if at all, long after 2017, Iran has an incentive to agree as Iran has secured its Shia crescent allowing ground access to supplies and reinforcements from and to Hezbollah in Lebanon."

This just crossed my desk from Stratfor and while it confirms my forecast, events could evolve towards an earlier capture. I cannot forecast a timeframe for capture until sufficient forces are mobilized and it is clear the YPG-Turkey confrontation as noted is a significant hurdle See all rights reserved Stratfor 2016. ""Even the United States has had to admit that the Kurdish YPG ‚Äî still the largest component of the Syrian Democratic Forces ‚Äî will, by necessity, play a decisive role in the operation to retake Raqqa. Yet that will pose a significant risk in itself, raising the possibility of inflaming the country's deeply rooted sectarian tensions. This danger has alarmed several U.S. partners, including the United Kingdom, and British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon has warned that Raqqa's Arab population may not welcome a Kurdish invasion"" ""The ally that could most impede Washington's plans, however, is Turkey. Ankara not only shares London's concerns of rivalries emerging between Arabs and Kurds, but it also holds great hostility toward the Kurdish YPG. Turkey, anxious to avoid relying on or strengthening the Kurds, has instead proposed an alternative: Postpone the Raqqa operation until the coalition gains enough Arab fighters to replace the YPG in the offensive. Turkey has even begun to train Arab fighters on its own side of the Syrian border, and it has promised to actively participate in the operation if the Kurds are excluded from it."" and ""But Ankara's plan would not be put into practice fast enough for Washington's liking. The United States wants to start the Raqqa operation immediately, and since the Syrian Democratic Forces are the only group ready to do so, the United States appears to be intent on placing the offensive on their shoulders. Turkey's opposition could be problematic, though. Syria's Turkish-backed rebels are already clashing with Kurdish YPG units in northern Aleppo; further conflict, or perhaps a rebel push toward Manbij, could easily distract the Kurds from the Raqqa operation down the road"" My thesis is that until Erdogan moves, the US and coalition offensive against Raqqa is on hold. The Turkish army is NATO's second largest but as noted in my last forecast citing Anatolia News; The Turks and their FSA allies are still battling for Mambij. A change of administration may change this forecast. But as long as US waits on Erdogan, and its been several years, no significant progress will be made. Counter-intuitively one can argue that further YPG moves on Raqqa could be a powerful incentive for Erdogan to act on Raqqa. But to date such action is likely to involve targeting Kurds and forestalling siege of city. Moving Erdogan or ignoring Erdogan are options but impossible to assess now. When will the operation has begin? Not until forces in place. Mosul operation began in October. so for the moment Raqqa's days are numbered but there is no present expiration date for ISIS rule of Raqqa. Still assembling forces and resolving irreconcilable conflict between YPG and Erdogan are required for success assuming no US ground troops. https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/setting-sights-raqqa-other-islamic-state-stronghold?utm_source=paidlist-a&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=12/27/2016&utm_content=Syria%3A+Anti-Islamic+State+Forces+Approaching+Key+Dam Posting Stratfor Battle Map on Twitter."

ISIS will be well dug in and will use suicide attacks. It will probably take at least 8-12 weeks to clear the city once an assault begins, even if the operations go well. - The SDF look to be the most likely to take the city. They have been an effective fighting force so far but have not had to clear a major city comparable to Raqqa (I think?). - The political dimension is so complicated that it could cause the operation to be delayed for a number of reasons. Syrian government forces could make a dash to get in on the action, or could simply make an effort to delay an SDF assault (in conjunction with Russia). - Turkey also has a bad relationship with Kurdish groups, and could also make efforts to stop the SDF from capturing a large city. - To be liberated before June, the SDF would need 'all their ducks in a row' - no political snags, and a well planned operation that does not get bogged down like Mosul."

My guess is that after Aleppo and before Raqqa Assad will want to continue with dealing with the rebel held, but non-IS towns in Syria. The US is busy with Mosul. So my guess is that although Raqqa is being attacked by air and by some Kurdish ground forces it is being left to last as it is politically the most difficult target because it could end up being attacked by Assad/Russia/Iran/Kurds/US. One calculation might be that if a major attack on Raqqa is delayed until after the US administration takes over the political complexity might be very different. For example Trump might be willing to join Assad and Russia against Raqqa on condition that the Iranian leave Syria and Iraq, and the Kurds might be offered a deal to expand their areas of control in Iraq while pulling back from the border between Turkey and Syria. (At some point either the Kurds get offered an autonomous area in Syria or Assad, Iran or Turkey will seek to crush them in Syria)"

However although is a former Turkish Minister of Agriculture he is not currently a Minister and so probably should not be assumed to be particularly well informed on what Turkey plans to do in Syria. But Turkey does have a large and (presumably) effective army that is already in both Syria and Iraq, and is close enough to be able to maintain supply lines much more easily than most other outside forces. Turkey is also Sunni which is an advantage attacking in Sunni areas (i.e. less resented than Iran would be). It might make sense for Turkey to act to stop Kurds taking Raqqa and/or Mosul. And Russia, Iran, Assad, US, Kurds etc can hardly publicly object to Turkey cities from IS (although Iraq has told Turkey to keep out of Mosul.) It has not shifted my forecast by much."

So far the pro-Syrian government forces have not shown a lot of interest in attacking Raqqa, they are more interested in Aleppo. Moving Iraqi government or allied militias from Iraq into Syria in order to capture Raqqa would seem to be likely to make the political situation even worse. If Syrian Kurds looked like capturing Raqqa I would imagine Turkey would intervene to stop the Kurds. If Turkey tried to capture Raqqa I would imagine Russia would intervene to stop them unless Turkey had agreed it with Assad. For Turkey to help Assad would mean changing sides. I guess Assad could ask Iran to try and capture Raqqa, but it seems Assad thinks it is his interest to keep IS in business for now. I can't see the US and other outsiders wanting to stir up more trouble by invading Syria to capture Raqqa (which would be the case if not invited by Assad) and I can't see Assad and the US making a deal to jointly capture Raqqa while war crimes are being committed in Aleppo. So while Raqqa might be bombed I don't see it being captured until after Aleppo has fallen, and even then I would expect a delay before Assad moved to Raqqa."

The assaults on Aleppo and Mosul make Raqqa the likely end of Phase One in this part of the world. Phase Two - deciding what to do about al-Assad and planning how to contain ISIS - may be even more difficult. Much will depend on how ISIS responds to the eventual fall of Mosul. Will they send their remaining forces to Raqqa and fight to the bitter end? Or will they take their fight to the world, with an onslaught of lone wolf attacks from Bangladesh to Berlin? I suspect the latter, which may necessitate Raqqa becoming a closed city until the threat is secured. What times we live in."

Turkish army may continue to advance east along border to clear out YPG. And Turkish Army is accompanied by Free Syrian Army. Turkey can only impede the short term fight for Raqqua by attacking YPG in rear. So Turkey is fighting ISIS and YPG.

Their thinking seems to be that as long as ISIL commits atrocities they (Assad & co) have an excuse to also commit, slightly less heinous atrocities, on anyone who does not support Assad. Its clear that Assad & co have put a lot more effort into trying to capture Aleppo than they have in trying to capture Raqqa.

Even with US military help, recapturing Mosul will require sustained, coordinated effort, which the Iraqis have trouble exerting. Just reuniting the women and children of Fallujah with their husband and sons may tax the system to the stall point, as Shiite militias will have a different view of the process than the central government. In the meantime, Pres. Erdogan finds himself in a truly uncomfortable spot following the Istanbul airport attack. Having looked the other way-- towards the Kurds-- while thousands of wannabe jihadis crossed the Syrian frontier, he effectively entered into a co-dependent relationship with Islamic State. That relationship has started to fray. Adding to his dyspepsia, the U.S. and Russia have differing preferred outcomes in Syria, a situation unlikely to be resolved before, or by the results of, the U.S. presidential election. Creeping chaos is not something he can weather indefinitely. But as a NATO member, his military options are constrained. The Obama administration has made it clear by word and deed that US boots will not be on the ground in Syria (with the exception of special forces). It's certainly possible that domestic political pressure to retaliate could build to the breaking point in the absence of coalition help, but that would put Turkey at the center, not just the front line, of the Syrian civil war until its resolution. His actions until now suggest that Pres. Erdogan has no such appetites. Quite frankly, no one does."

While ISIS is weakening, there in no indication yet that Raqqa is at risk of being captured any time soon. ISIS is likely to lose other possessions before Raqqa. While the anti-ISIS forces are numerous, they are not coordinated and those directly involved either have no major commitment or they are not strong enough alone. With the US elections coming up, a major offensive is unlikely. Low likelihood over the next six months and slightly higher but still low for the next six (six months is a fairly narrow window). To attribute high probability to any six-month window, specific evidence is needed, which I do not currently see.

Best to ignore the recent resurgence by ISIS forces. There will likely be several more advances and retreats before this battle is done. I think a relatively quick resolution is possible if the factions assaulting the ISIS ""capital"" actually coordinate their attacks, but that's not going to happen - defeating ISIS is not as important as being proclaimed the victor. And that's perhaps the key here. There is so much political capital at stake in Raqqa. Assad's sovereignty gains some legitimacy if ""his"" troops retake the city, while victory for the US backed SDF will no doubt embolden claims for an independent Kurdish state in Syria. Adding spice to the mix are the conflicting ambitions of Russia and America. Bottom line: There is plenty of incentive to retake Raqqa before you even begin to factor in its importance to the broader war. It is no accident that ISIS has been so resolute in Raqqa and Mosul, the cities with access to the biggest dams in Syria and Iraq. Whoever controls the water has influence over vast amounts of territory. And, of course, these dams are potential weapons of mass destruction. It may be critical for Raqqa to be taken before Aleppo."
