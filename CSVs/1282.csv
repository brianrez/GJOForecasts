"Between 1 October 2018 and 30 September 2019, will an armed group from Nigeria engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Nigeria?",2018-09-28T23:00:05Z,2019-01-01T07:59:05Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],68,654,32,237,"The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (Early Warning Project). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 31 December 2018 and will be resolved in October 2019 after EWP assesses the situation in Nigeria from October 2018 to September 2019. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilian fatalities occur in one or more campaigns. See (Early Warning Project) for examples. See (GJOpen) for GJO's FAQ on forecasting questions like this.",https://www.gjopen.com/questions/1018-between-1-october-2018-and-30-september-2019-will-an-armed-group-from-nigeria-engage-in-a-campaign-that-systematically-kills-1-000-or-more-civilians-in-nigeria

By far, the biggest threat to civilian safety the past few years has been the militant Islamist movement Boko Haram. This group does target civilians through suicide bombings and other attacks, but the group's power has declined after significant efforts on the part of the Nigerian military and other countries in the region. In 2017, the group killed more than 300 people, but nothing suggests that these killings were systematic or in a single campaign. Although the military itself does have high levels of corruption and extrajudicial killings, and other armed groups are active, it is unlikely that any single group would be motivated or able to commit systematic killings on such a large scale."
