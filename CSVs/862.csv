Obviously this is excruciatingly close to middle two answers, and a gust of wind either way could put it in one category or the next. Perhaps the COVID Tracking Projects releases numbers later than usual Sunday, or perhaps the fri-sun averages are blown out of the water this week. Of course we cannot discount anything as impossible (unless the number has already been passed), but I deem a surge to above 1.2M highly unlikely (1%), and a delay is posting data, keeping cases 'posted' low, equally as unlikely.

Supposedly tests will double in next week but so far a high of about 315,000 in a day. If they could keep up the 315,000 there would be added about 2,205,000 tests to the present total of 5,457,990. 14% of that is about 1,079,000. Dr Birx said test would double in next week but really? Going with the 315,000 a day mostly now because they have not even sustained that yet. The number of tests and daily percent makes a difference."
