The CDC recommendations for cruise lines to lift the no sail order creates high hurdles for the companies: crew members having single cabins, for example.[1] I can't imagine it is possible to run a cruise in that manner. It seems to me an important point of reference for the CDC's decision will be the race between the rate of vaccination to reach herd immunity and the spread of the new variants. We can't really know what September and October will look like yet since there are so many contingencies. I imagine the White House will allow the CDC to use its best collective scientific judgment of when it is safe to resume cruising, despite the lobbying campaign from the governor of Florida and the cruise industry."

Besides the cruise industry all sector profit. The pressure is mounting on the CDC which insist on leaving the conditional no sail order in place until November. I believe they will crumble and therefore adjusted heavily to the period from July to September so this industry gets pro business support as well. I believe lawsuits on the way in the next months in case CDC blocks them any longer since there is no need any longer. CDC left themselves a face saving backdoor by saying there is some interagency dialogue going on that means Commerce Departmen etc. feel the pressure from the lobby. There wil be a compromise in favour for cruise lines.

The CSO basically provides a bunch of new things cruise lines must do in order to be allowed back on the water, and the culmination of them is a cruise trial run, which has real passengers who have volunteered and are aware of the risks. I believe the trial run would leave from a continental US port, and qualify for this question. Carnival doesn't have a trial run you can sign up for, but royal carribean got 100,000+ signups for their as yet unscheduled trial run. It is conceivable to me that the trial run could be filled with only vaccinated guests (this isn't currently a req) before april 1, but the biggest hurdle is that the biden administration is totally allowed to modify or slow roll down the CSO. Still, the trial run will probably happen in the first half of the new year"

The priority of this event's rescheduling and not postponement likely indicates the company is beginning to think resuming operations is a possibility in the near term. Combined with the roll out of two vaccines in the US in the last two weeks there are probably multiple avenues for the company to start sailing again. These include getting their frontline employees vaccinated and opening cruises only to those that have been immunized. This paves a narrow way forward to get approval to resume operations before operations to both get the required staff set, as well as sell enough tickets to make it worthwhile. On the other hand, a less involved approach would be just waiting for approval and at which point April through June makes sense. Any first sails between October and the end of 2021 would likely be the result of company financial difficulty or bankruptcy vice any COVID related concerns."
