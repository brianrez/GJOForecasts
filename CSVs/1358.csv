In November 2017, Russia passed a law which allows the government to designate media outlets receiving funding from abroad as ""foreign agents"" and subject designated entities to additional requirements or sanctions (Reuters). The following month, nine entities were designated as foreign agents, including Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (Reuters).

The only push for Russian Ministry of Justice to list more media outlets is if the US puts sanctions on Russian media outlets. A question I have been struggling to find an answer is how many other US-funded media outlets are operating in Russia except the already listed as foreign agents? And how many foreign media outlets in numbers and percentages in contrast to domestic media outlets operate in Russia? What I could find out is that the press and internet media is the only possibility for foreign-funded media to use at the moment, as according to multiple sources and especially the report made from Harvard, 94% in shares in television is hold by the state; ( https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shleifer/files/media.pdf ) while the main read newspapers are actually Russian such as Metro,Moskovsky Komsomolets, Rossiyskaya Gazeta. (https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2013/12/brief-history-russian-media/) and same goes for radio as well - the most listened are Russian owned radios. Another factor to consider is the relations between Russia and the US at the moment and are there any possibilities of Russia listing more media outlets. Such forecast is very volatile as the US-Russia relations are very fragile, however, following the meeting between the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov - both sides are working to collaborate and optimize their relationship. ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/11/russia-passes-bill-internet-cut-off-foreign-servers) Points of conflict exist and they are multiple: Syria, the Arctic, Iran, Chinese market, Huawei, Crimea, North Korea and Venezuela among the most reactive and important, as well as the Mueller's investigation which goes along with other European-based investigation on Russian meddling in elections - keeping in mind the European election that is upcoming, this would be a soft belly between Western powers and Russia. Nevertheless, ""Moscow may review the decision if Washington halts the crackdown on Russian media, according to the official."

I have not given any percentage to any of the reduction options, as I find it unlikely that the Russian government will reduce the list, seeing as the relationship between Russia and the West has not improved since the creation of the list. Another aspect I have taken into account is the fact that Russia in July 2018 passed a law that makes it possible for them to label individual journalists as foreign agents (source: https://europeanjournalists.org/blog/2018/07/05/russia-passes-new-law-to-label-individual-journalists-as-foreign-agents/). This law also gives the government the right to block websites and blogs without a court ruling.

Its establishment was seen as a direct response to the US after the US requested Russia Today, a state-funded Russian media outlet, to register itself as foreign agent pursuant to the ‘Foreign Agent Registration Act’. The register and the new focus on media outlets by Russian regulators might have been a novelty in this form, however, the underlying legal structure mirrors laws which aimed at NGOs by requesting them to register as “foreign agents” (2012 version) and later on allowed the Russian authorities “to prosecute foreign non-governmental organisations (NGOs) or firms designated as ‘undesirable’” (BBC 2015). Since then, the number and the targeted entities remained the same (9 media outlets). Meanwhile, the number of targeted NGOs declined from 135 entities in 2016 to 74 in 2018 as external funding stopped or Russian branches of Western NGOs closed (researched by user @mbayer123). In what extent this decrease has an effect on the assessed probability will be elaborated in the following paragraphs. Furthermore, it is important to consider the remaining time of less than 2 months for the forecast due to its minimizing effect on the probability of an extreme change in the trend. As a logical result, the options which ‘border’ the most likely outcome seem to be more likely than the extremes at the edges."

In its original form, it concerned only non-governmental organizations with foreign funding and political activities. In November 2017, it was extended to media outlets. For an adequate estimation of the number of registered media outlets on June 1, 2019, the forecast at hand will consider three things: first, the reasons for the establishment of the law and its extension respectively, the numbers of registered organizations on the list, as well as the reasoning for corresponding labeling and finally, the differences between NGOs and media-outlets will be reviewed. The introduction of the law, in the first place, had primarily domestic reasons, namely the mass protests between the parliamentary and presidential elections in winter 2011/spring 2012 (https://www.dw.com/de/was-ausl%C3%A4ndischer-agent-in-den-usa-und-russland-bedeutet/a-41469379). However, already in 2012, official statements referred to the US Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) that itself registers foreign lead organizations and demands disclosure of their finances and activities in the US (https://www.dw.com/de/ngos-in-russland-angeschlagen-aber-ungeschlagen/a-41454896). The amendment of the law and its corresponding extension on media outlets in 2017 were then in fact a direct consequence of the worsening relations between the US and Russia. Washington accused Moscow of having influenced its presidential election in 2016 - also with the help of the state-controlled and financed media outlet RT. As a consequence, RT had to register as a ""foreign agent"" under FARA on November 13 following a request by US authorities. The Kremlin regarded this as an attack on Russian media and interests and introduced the media law only days after the incident. Today, April 6, 2019 there are 74 organizations registered as foreign agents in Russia (http://unro.minjust.ru/NKOForeignAgent.aspx), as well as 9 media outlets (https://minjust.ru/ru/deyatelnost-v-sfere-nekommercheskih-organizaciy/reestr-inostrannyh-sredstv-massovoy-informacii). While the media outlet list has not changed since December 2017, when exclusively US affiliated media outlets were labeled as foreign agents, only days after the introduction of the law, the corresponding NGO list has faced more changes. While the law was introduced in July 2012, it was not before June 2013 that the first organizations were correspondingly labeled, so round about a year later (http://unro.minjust.ru/NKOForeignAgent.aspx), after preceding public searching of NGO offices in spring 2013. Throughout the years the number of foreign agent changed since many of the affected organizations stopped foreign funding or were dissolved. In July 2016, for instance, there were still 135 organizations on the list (https://www.boell.de/de/2016/09/13/zivilgesellschaft-russland-wo-unterstuetzung-von-aussen-lebensnotwendig-wird), in November 2017 87 (https://www.dw.com/de/ngos-in-russland-angeschlagen-aber-ungeschlagen/a-41454896), and as of today, as above mentioned, 74."

That’s why is unlikely that the number of foreign agents would decrease. Additionally, in 2017 the number of media outlets designated as foreign agents was 9 and it has not increased so far, even if there were the conditions for Russia to do that. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-42234582 Concerning the EU, in 2015 has been established a task force to fight cyber disinformation episodes, in particular the ones from Russia. This team has succeeded, and the EU has also warned against possible Russian inference during the campaigns for European elections. Currently, the Commission is even strengthening its battle against the circulation of fake news. It allocated several millions of euros (from 1.9 million euros in 2018 to 5 million euros in 2019 to EEAS, responsible of identifying misinformation campaigns), to this struggle, in particular on internet platforms. https://www.thenewfederalist.eu/european-elections-russia-and-fake-news-under-commission-s-scrutiny In particular, countries like France are fighting a war against disinformation (with the new law to remove ""fake news"" during electoral campaign and with Macron's claims on Russia medias). This actions could make Russia want to respond, adding new media outlets in its list."

Acknowledging the common tone of American and Russian diplomatic relations, I find logical to define Putin’s move as a response to the American allegations that took place in 2017. Hence, I believe that the current list is a manifestation of dissatisfaction within a certain context and therefore, I find it unlikely that the list will further be used. Moreover, I find most likely that the 9 figure represents the number of medias deemed to generally interfere in Russian politics and will therefore remain as such. Hence, I assign a probability of 80% for the list to remain with 9 medias and 0% to be reduced. However, considering the latest claims of the French president Emmanuel Macron on Russian media, it is important to keep in mind that there is still a good possibility that Putin decides to enlarge the list in response to French politics, therefore assigning a probability of 20% to additional media to be designated by the Russian Ministry of Justice. Nevertheless, it is very unlikely that the number of potential medias to be added before June surpasses the number of medias that were designated after the events of 2017, therefore considering ""more than 20"" impossible."

Hence, it seems very unlikely that the number of medias designated as foreign agents will surpass the current 9. Hence, the 8-10 interval is assigned a 95% probability. However, the pending results of the Mueller investigation in the US could increase tensions around any Russian media outlets in the US, and hence, Russia could retaliate by increasing the number of US entities on the list of foreign agents.

It may be a little more like that all the RFE/RL outlets close at the same time, taking the number below 3, rather than just one agent closing down. For Russia to add more agents to the list, something would need to happen to upset them, so e.g. US or another country would need to restrict Russia media or otherwise upset Putin, which seems seems most likely, if the US shows undoubtable evidence of Russia medling, but even then the US would probably, one would hope, try to think before acting and look for better ways to address this than open aggression through one sided measures."

Also, if they went out of business, I doubt they would be removed from the list in that case. I see a low likelihood of media outlets being added. Possible scenarios: 1) tit-for-tat connected to some events in the US or elsewhere 2) more ""domestic"" media outlets will be deemed fit for the list For both scenarios, I also see about a 50:50 probability that only one media outlet gets added in one go. Given there are currently 9 on the list I guess overall I am estimating 30% probability that media outlets get added, 15% that multiple get added in one go. Should one single outlet get added to the list, will have to revise 11 to 20 bucket probability up."
