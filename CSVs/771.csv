In the past week he has cancelled negotiations, offered a higher number than ever before, and told his main negotiator to make a deal. The GOP are currently prioritizing the SCOTUS vote and likely won't even discuss their 'skinny stimulus' deal until later this week, a deal which is almost certainly going to be roundly rejected in the House even if it does pass the Senate given their recent rejection of Trump's offer. And the House has made clear what it expects in a deal and is unlikely to agree to anything less.

Rep won't give the Dems a victory that late ahead of the Nov 3rd elections. They'd rather drive that bus into the wall than give up an inch of their playing field. (Donald Trump has already announced that the US will see themselves in a recession worse than the ""Great Depression""[!] when and if Joe Biden is taking office, at his campaign rally in Pennsylvania. What he did not tell the folks there: that there is always a time lag in economic policy between cause and effect, and that any financial and economic crisis that will break out in the lame duck period before Biden, is solely caused by 45 POTUS and the current administration.) In this respect, I fear there is a repetition of the beginning of 2008 Obama 1st term: The Republican designed Subprime Crisis and the following ""Great Recession"" will be inherited to a Democratic president, who then has to ""save the world as we know it"", and because the merits come late and indebtedness of the U.S. is set to rise anyway, someone else takes all the political capital to earn and the merits in another election. History repeats, but maybe for a last time before the economic superpower USA has come to a point of no return and to the end of a historic cycle of dominance. Last chance, last round, last order."

If Republicans starting position is over $100 billion and the Dems are proposing almost 10 times that, it is very difficult to see a bill being passed that doesn't meet this standard, so the question then becomes will a bill be passed by November 3rd? As of today, Republicans are still trying to frame the debate as if Democrats are stalling the discussion. However, Dems proposed a bill months ago and Reps are only recently getting into the fight, so I doubt this argument will play well with voters much longer. More likely, Reps will make a few concessions in order to divert the pressure to Dems, who will either counter with concessions of their own (you know, negotiate) or accept the proposal as is. Not passing some bill has implications that are currently unclear for both parties, so they both have an incentive to get a deal done before the election.

The FED is going to back all the muni bonds. So if the us gov't sends money to the states to help them cover their next bond payment, then the payment will flow to the FED, which is the Us gov't, so the gov't will be paying itself. This is a no cost move with only upside political implications. The fiction of solvency continues. I bet the amount is more like 300 billion dollars though some will be targeted towards election security, school reopening, and distance learning."

President Trump is has also spoken about releasing a new stimulus bill soon. With both branches motivated to pass legislation quickly, I suspect that the new package will come well before the November 3 deadline. The total amount will most likely be less than the first round based off the current stances of the Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell and the house Treasury Steve Mnuchin. Republicans are seemingly in favor of limited checks to those who are making less than $40,000. They are also in favor of lowering the amount of Unemployment Insurance from the $600. This will probably limit the total amount of direct financial assistance to under $1 trillion according to early reported estimates. With early estimates seemingly starting at that amount, it is highly likely that the new stimulus package will well exceed the $100 Billion threshold."

And if that is possible, it is also possible that a limited stimulus without state/local help is passed. It really isn't far fetched. If GOP holds firm against too much stimulus now and loses the presidency (even without Senate control new legislation will pass one way or another), then Dems can quickly rush to pass giant packages in new term. If GOP holds firm against too much stimulus now and wins, GOP can pass giant packages- rewarding red states/states that came through in the general. Assigning a too low probability to this outcome (which can happen as a result of various scenarios- not just that aforementioned one) is a mistake. But I agree there is overwhelming pressure to pass one more round of meaningful stimulus where States also participate and the ask from the most populous states would easily surpass 100bln, with the other states demanding some proportionate-ish share to prove they are co-equal states- whether or not that's true from a per capita perspective."
