There is large uncertainty, but the current numbers available through portoptimizer.com suggest that Nov 2021 total import TEUs will probably be just under Nov 2020 total import TEUs and that Nov 2021 total TEUs will likely be < Nov 2020 total TEUs, which would put the forecast in bin 2. (See my previous forecasts for details.) But, I realized that the same forecast method would have underestimated October's numbers. So, new forecast minimum for Nov: 0.985/0.98 * 1.925 * 466k = 902k. But even this is likely an underestimate by up to 60k, as I think the portoptimizer data, even used relative to the numbers they give for previous years, often underestimates current TEUs relative to previous years. So, I'm shifting my forecast up. I do think bins 1 and 4 are out at this point, but there's so much uncertainty with the port data that bin 2 is still quite possible."

But it adjusted down again and is now only 1.78% higher than last year this week. I bet it will be adjusted even lower tomorrow and again after the week is over. The pattern is clear: 9 out of 11 of the past weeks have seen TEU volumes lower than last year. I had hoped that the current focus on the port might mean things would take off, but they do not seem to have the leadership and/or powers they need to clear the backlog. So I suspect that Nov 21 will be below Nov 20, or at most about 2% greater. And then the question is how low. Oct 21 is likely to be 82% of Oct 20. Oct 20 was 27% above Oct 19, and Nov 20 was 22% above Nov 19, so I suspect Nov 21 won't be as low as 82% of Nov 20. But it could easily be 90% of Nov 20, right on the lines between bins 1 and 2. I'll see how this week's TEUs come in and adjust from there. It's looking most likely that Nov 21 will be ~95% of Nov 20. Further info: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1350451"
