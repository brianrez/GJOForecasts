Petits-Doigts calls the governor of Nebraska, who claims to be happy about all this and confident that the PSC will do a good job of deciding. The governor has no special control over the independent five-member PSC; it is not clear whether the Prez just doesn't know this, or has been advised by his son-in-law or daughter that it would put the PSC members in an odd ethical position if the Prez calls them to intervene. My money's on the former, ethics never having loomed large in the family legend."

""The Missouri River crossing is the last major piece of the 1,172-mile pipeline to be constructed. Energy Transfer Partners officially received the easement the evening of Feb. 8.

""The order said it was complying with Trump's Jan. 24 memorandum that instructed the Army to expedite approval of Dakota Access ""to the extent permitted by law,"" and consider withdrawing a prior directive for an environmental impact statement on the project, which the order also did. The environmental impact statement was requested by the Army in December, and was to include an examination of alternate routes and the risk of oil spills. . . .

""To abandon the [environmental impact statement] would amount to a wholly unexplained and arbitrary change based on the President's personal views and, potentially, personal investments. We stand ready to fight this battle against corporate interest superseding government procedure and the health and wellbeing of millions of Americans,"" the tribe said in a statement. . . .

The Corps said “ETP must satisfy the provisions of the federal Mineral Leasing Act which include an approval of an easement to work on federal land and the notification of Congress” (nytimes.com) - neither have been done. The second case was filed by the tribes to challenge the federal permits for the pipeline at more than 200 water crossings. Judge Boasberg has asked for “the government to promptly notify the court should it change its position regarding the easement” (nytimes.com).
