""In a statement to The Daily Beast, RNC spokesperson Emma Vaughn said the transfer from the joint fundraising committee (JFC) was “standard practice.” “This is standard operating procedure when dealing with a joint fundraising agreement that is no longer in use. Based on a prior agreement, the RNC is transferring its funds from the JFC to the RNC based on standard practice"" ""When asked, Vaughn would not say whether the committee was going to terminate, or if the groups were preserving the relationship. Former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had offloaded the cash in her old JFC by the same point in 2017, and filed to shut down the committee; TMAGA still sits on $13 million, and has not dissolved its joint fundraising agreement.""

His allies and advisers say the money is designed to show political strength ahead of 2024 as he weighs a bid for the presidency, and that he plans to contribute some of it to candidates he has endorsed in the 2022 midterms. So far, Save America, his leadership PAC, has not given to the 2022 candidates he has endorsed, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Several people familiar with the former president’s operation said that Afghanistan fundraising pitches performed exceptionally well, as supporters aggrieved at President Biden’s actions looked for a way to oppose him. “After the election, there was some erosion,” one of these people said. “But as the months have gone on, people have come back and started giving more.”"" https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-2024-campaign-candidacy/2021/10/03/73af3b12-21f8-11ec-b3d6-8cdebe60d3e2_story.html"

Whether that would change donors' donating behavior I don't know, I suspect not as much as one might think given how polarized the American electorate has become. So Trump might not have any real incentive to avoid that sort of spending, but how that impacts overall cash on hand for the PACs, I guess if he feels free to spend more then they'd have less cash left unless donors increased their donation rates. so I'm going to readjust my baseline just a bit to account for the possibility that Trump spends down more from the PACs this year than I originally thought he might."
