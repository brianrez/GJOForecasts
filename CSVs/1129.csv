Slow down in international trade as well as beginning of next political cycle in the U.S. are bearish on interest rates. And key is he slow down in the housing market.

The Fed can use the existing QE portfolio to effect a number of interest rate scenarios, without making a ‘traditional’ policy change.

Housing is no longer the economic sector that domestic monetary policy would be looking to stimulate.
