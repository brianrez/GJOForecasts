More interesting (and revealing) information is that while the moderates and conservatives are overwhelmingly against this proposition, only 46% of the liberals (and also 46% for the Democrats) are for it. So it appears that affirmative is not as favored by the liberals as commonly believed."

Endorsements for the 'Yes' side are a lot stronger, leading Democrats including Joe Biden's running mate Kamala Harris. That being said, the 'Yes' side has a long distance to catch up - ballotpedia has them down by 10 points and even if the undecideds swing 2/3 towards 'Yes', they would still be losing by 52/48. It may be a close vote but in my view the most likely outcome is still a 'No' vote."

Current political climate supports such a change, especially in a state like CA, and the wording on the ballot is compelling to say the least (i.e. calling it ""Allow Diversity as a Factor in Public Employment, Education, and Contracting Decisions. Legislative Constitutional Amendment""). I mean, what honest Californian would vote against diversity? I think it will pass, though I am a little worried how it may be used in future legislation and rulings given it says nothing about the negative discrimination that could occur. Could this allow someone to be fired or not hired based on race or sexual orientation or some other characteristic? If anyone knows I'd love to hear it."
