However, that relationship was positive overall (which makes sense), which was different than our hypothesis (As the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate declines, it is more likely that there will be an increase in the federal minimum wage). I feel that if we had isolated the regression to a specific set of years that demonstrated our hypothesis, it would have been correct. Given my data analysis combined with the lack of time associated with this prediction, I am decreasing the probability to 1%."

With the past midterms, the house is now controlled by the Republicans and the senate, the democrats. Most likely, the bill would not pass the house in time for March 1st. Additionally, with the house majority leader Kevin Mcarthy only winning his speakership by a small margin of votes, he is at the expense of the republican party, with members from the party heavily influencing which bills will end up seeing the house floor for voting, which is why I have kept my vote at 0%. With all this information holding true for another week, this upholds the prediction as we get closer to March 1st. With the deadline approaching in less than one week, it would not be very plausible that the bill would be passed or introduced. With recent commotion among the republican party, such as Mitt Romney calling out Margie Taylor Green and George Santos, I find it hard to believe that the party would come together to pass a bill on minimum wage. This issue is typically not favored by the party in general, so it is unlikely that this will even see the light of day in the republican held House. However, following the running of the regression table I conducted proved my initial hypothesis--If GDP decreases, the minimum wage will increase, to be false as the regression had a positive result. Yet since the GDP of the US is not decreasing, the minimum wage will most likely not be raised."

After running the regression, I found a statistically significant result with 95% confidence between GDP and federal minimum wage. The coefficient for this relationship was positive, indicating that as GDP increases, the likelihood of an increase in federal minimum wage rises. The regression proved my original hypothesis–– if GDP decreases, then the likelihood of federal minimum wage increasing rises–– wrong. Since the GDP has been increasing, there likely will be an increase in federal minimum wage eventually, but as the bill to do so has still only been introduced, with no further progress in Congress, and March 1st is less than one week away, it is highly improbable that the legislation will pass given the timeframe."

March 1st is only two weeks away, and this short time frame makes it seem unlikely that the federal minimum wage will increase before this date, though an increase in federal minimum wage might come eventually. Utilizing Bayesian updating to change my prior beliefs based on new information, I tried finding recent news articles regarding legislation to increase the federal minimum wage, and the only articles that I could find (from reputable sources) related to state minimum wage. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’ 2022 data on federal minimum wage, there is a relationship between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and federal minimum wage: for example, from 2007-2009, there was a decrease in GDP and an increase in federal minimum wage. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reports that in the fourth quarter of 2022, there was a steady increase in GDP, as there has been for a number of years, and if we apply the hypothesized relationship between GDP and federal minimum wage to this forecast, it seems that legislation raising the US federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour will not occur as it (1) might not be deemed a priority in Congress in the given timespan and (2) there is no decrease in GDP."

While the US is headed in the direction of a recession, which is typically an indicator that the federal minimum wage will increase, recent data shows that the economy has not reached that point yet. A recession occurs when there are at least two consecutive quarters of negative GDP. The most recent report of the GDP was +2.9% which is graded ""good"", meaning that the US economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.9% in the fourth and last quarter of 2022. This leads me to believe that the US will not be entering into a recession for at least a few months since this outcome would require the next two quarters to have negative GDP. The fact that the US economy has not experienced even one quarter with a negative GDP this year makes it very unlikely that Congress's first priority will be to raise the federal minimum wage in the next two weeks. In addition, in the current 118th Congress, Republicans hold 222 seats in the US House of Representatives and Democrats hold 212 seats. The last time that federal minimum wage increased was in 2009 when Democrats held more seats than Republicans. Given that Republicans have more control over the House this year, there is a very small chance that they will pass legislation raising the federal minimum wage by March 1st, 2023."

109046,2023-02-10T20:00:28Z,1,[6.0],[6.0],"Firstly, the timeline in which the legislation would need to be passed is widely unrealistic. Also, the divided government plays a role in the likelihood of legislation raising the US federal minimum wage, as a Republican-controlled House is problematic for those that would like to see the minimum wage raised. Also, the minimum wage hasn't increased since 2009 (because of the 2008 Recession), and though there are talks about the economic downturn, I don't think there is the level of urgency needed (yet) for a raise in the minimum wage. I chose a 6% chance because while I find it highly improbable, there are unknowns such as ""What bills are going to be brought to the floor?"" or ""Will that bill be proposed within the time frame?"". Overall, while signs could point to yes for an increase in the minimum wage at some point, I don't find it realistic within the timeframe."

Based on current discussions in the news, it has been evident that raising the minimum wage is not a legislative priority for most Members of the House. That said, we are unsure of what will be brought to the House floor in the next month and thus cannot say there is no chance of this happening. Historically, the minimum wage has been raised during times of economic uncertainty, which the US has certainly seen recently, suggesting the minimum wage may be raised soon, it's just highly unlikely that ""soon"" means by March 1."

The last time there was an increase in minimum wage was right after the 2008 recession ended, suggesting that an increase occurs at the end of economic recessions. At this point, even though expected to happen this year, the US is not in an economic recession, which leads me to believe that there is a very small change that an increase will occur before March 1st, 2023."

One of the most current bills regarding raising federal minimum wage is the Living Wage Now Act, and it has only been introduced to Congress and still has yet to be passed in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, then signed by the President before becoming a law, all of which is unlikely to be done in three weeks (Congress.gov). Further, looking at the Democrat majority in Senate (by a sliver) and Republican majority in the House, it is unlikely that there would be any massive strides toward this legislation, especially since Republicans have rejected previous minimum wage hikes mentioned above in the question being forecasted (The Hill)."

It is in Biden's agenda, but in 2019, multiple committees refused to vote, and the bill died. There was a Raise the Wage Act of 2021 introduced in early 2021, but it was referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor on January 28, 2021, and still hasn't made any progress since then. If there is a federal raise, I don't think it likely it would occur before 1 March 2023. A lot more work will need to be done. Employees might need to depend more on individual employers or states raising the minimum wage rather than the government."
