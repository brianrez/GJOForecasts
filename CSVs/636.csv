99356,2021-03-07T22:03:51Z,1,[1.0],[1.0],There is a very small chance that Maduro will cease to be president of Venezuela before April 2021. Maduro has a strong influence in Venezuela and his opposition is not in a place that can act against him at the moment. The Venezuelan economy is in crisis and there doesn't seem to be any improvements. There aren't any fruitful steps being taken to remove Maduro from power.
99363,2021-03-07T22:00:05Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"Opposition support has evaporated. Maduro still controls significant institutions and enjoys military support. Barring involvement from the United States, he will remain ""President"" of Venezuela. The Biden administration has signaled that it will communicate with Maduro on a resolution if serious steps are taken to resolve the current issues at hand with the opposition."
98580,2021-03-07T20:33:21Z,1,[1.0],[1.0],"With only 24 days left until the deadline for this forecast, there are a number of reasons why I do not think there is a high probability that Maduro will cease to be president of Venezuela. First and foremost, Venezuela does not have any upcoming elections. Due to this, there are a limited number of ways that Maduro could be removed from his position. Various attempts to remove Maduro in recent years have failed, and Juan Guaido, political opposition to Maduro is losing support."
98728,2021-03-07T20:21:57Z,1,[1.0],[1.0],"Unless Maduro is forced out of office, it's highly likely that he will still be president of Venezuela at the end of the month. With the military and security forces remaining loyal to him, he can sit comfortably, knowing that he is well protected. Despite more than 50 nations recognizing Guaido as the new president, Maduro will most likely remain in power. The only ways in which Maduro would cease to be in power are a coup, another nation intervenes, or he simply drops dead. Venezuelan response to Maduro has been to migrate. More than 5 million have migrated since 2014."

98867,2021-03-06T23:11:15Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"Maduro's government has made some notable moves to assure that Maduro will remain the president of Venezuela. These actions include boycotting elections, a sure way to remain unopposed. There was a time when the adversarial actions from the US were up in the air depending on the outcome of the 2020 presidential election- but while President Biden has referred to the Venezuelan government as ""a dictatorship"", it doesn't seem that a real plan to change that status has been devised. Despite US pressure, Maduro has remained in power for years and hasn't been shaken by the American change in leadership. It's doubtful that a shift significant enough to put him out of power will happen in the next month."
98868,2021-03-06T21:02:18Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"The Trump administration attempted to oust Maduro through heavy sanctions and even placing a bounty on Maduro's arrest. Additionally, Washington led the international effort to recognize democratic leader, Juan Guido, as Venezuela's head of state (Aljazeera, 2020).The result was a total erosion of diplomatic ties and the hope in Washington that the Maduro regime would cripple under the economic pressure. Despite the pressure, Maduro has clung to power and his officials have spoken interest in resuming diplomatic ties with the US. Maduro has also survived an attempted coup and insurgency plot while retaining the majority support of his military (O'Connor, 2020). A prominent opposition figure of the Maduro regime, Leopoldo Lopez, fled Caracas despite being unable to effectively unseat the socialist dictator (The Guardian, 2020). Analysis - Since 1950, the world has experienced 475 coups, with 236 being successful. In South America, Honduras has experienced the only successful coup since 1996 (Taylor, 2016). With the support of Russia, China, Turkey, Iran, and Cuba, Maduro is unlikely to lose power especially given the trend among his opposition to leave the country. Aside from a 'black swan' event, Maduro will remain in power."
98731,2021-03-06T20:58:15Z,2,[2.0],[0.0],"There are a couple of reasons why it is extremely unlikely that Nicolas Maduro will cease to be president of Venezuela before April 1st, 2021. First is his widening grip over the Venezuelan government and his opposition’s, Juan Guaido's, concurrent loss of power. Though the Venezuelan parliament was previously controlled by the opposition party, that changed in December when legislative elections resulted in the Unified Socialist Party (PSUV) winning in a landslide victory, with the PSUV coalition subsequently filling 256 out of 277 seats in parliament. Now it should be clarified that these elections were boycotted by the four main opposition parties and condemned by many domestic and foreign actors; nevertheless, it resulted in Guaido losing his standing as leader of the National Assembly in January 2021. Though Guaido had been recognized by over 50 countries as interim president since the disputed re-election of Maduro in 2018, the EU stated in January that it could no longer legally recognize Guaido as interim president since he lost his position as head of the National Assembly (despite the EU not recognizing the vote itself). He is still recognized as interim president by the US and the UK, but overall, the opposition continues to lose traction as their leading politicians flee and Maduro's party gains more control (however illegitimate it may be) over the government. Secondly, Maduro has shown that sanctions placed on him and his associates, such as the oil and financial sanctions imposed by the US, are futile in trying to oust him. The EU has recently imposed sanctions on 19 more Venezuelan officials and has called for political talks in Venezuela to set up new elections, but there is very little chance that this will have an effect on Maduro's power, at least in the short term. Maduro has further cemented himself as ruling leader, exemplified that foreign efforts to oust him are futile, squashed the opposition for the most part, and has shown no intentions of surrendering or stepping down, making it extremely unlikely that he will cease to be president before April 1st. The only scenario in which he would cease to be president is if he was assassinated or there was a coup, but given that Maduro has control over Venezuelan security forces and has thwarted several assassination attempts in the past, this looks extremely unlikely as well; however, it is possible, which is why I gave a 2% chance of ""yes."" Overall, Maduro has managed to hold onto power for over seven years through strong opposition and international condemnation, and I, unfortunately, do not predict that changing within a month."

My reasoning for this comes from the protests that have taken place from 2017 to 2020 have yet to be seen in great force in 2021 (Otis, 2020). The Maduro regime has weakened the opposition party led by Juan Guaido (CIA, 2021), implementing strong restrictions on freedom of expression and the press. The corruption within the voting system in Venezuela has escalated to the point that many opposition party voters abstain from voting in national elections due to the National Election Council (CNE) being controlled by Maduro’s party and faking votes to assist Maduro (Reuters, 2021). I am leaving 5% room for Maduro to cease being president of Venezuela before 01APRIL2021 due to various environmental, security, and health factors."

Additional Maduro is still relatively young at 58 years old and appears by all accounts to be in good health. Thus I’d say there is an extremely low probability that Maduro will cease to be President of Venezuela before 1 April 2021."

98725,2021-03-04T21:19:27Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"Nicolas Maduro has a strong grip on power in Venezuela and has ruled as president since 2013. The support of the military, his party, and ally countries like Iran and Russia help to legitimize his government – despite many Western countries like the U.S. recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaido as the true interim president of Venezuela. On January 5th, 2021, following the December parliamentary elections, the governing socialist party assumed leadership of Venezuela’s congress. This was the last remaining institution in Venezuela not controlled by Maduro and his party."

98737,2021-03-04T01:23:04Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"Having no opposition, no scheduled elections, and previously squashing attempts to remove him by force, and placing allies in positions of power will enable him to remain in power."

98731,2021-03-03T23:36:39Z,1,[2.0],[2.0],"There are a couple of reasons why it is extremely unlikely that Nicolas Maduro will cease to be president of Venezuela before April 1st, 2021. First is his widening grip over the Venezuelan government and his opposition’s, Juan Guaido's, concurrent loss of power. Though the Venezuelan parliament was previously controlled by the opposition party, that changed in December when legislative elections resulted in the Unified Socialist Party (PSUV) winning in a landslide victory, with the PSUV coalition subsequently filling 256 out of 277 seats in parliament. Now it should be clarified that these elections were boycotted by the four main opposition parties and condemned by many domestic and foreign actors; nevertheless, it resulted in Guaido losing his standing as leader of the National Assembly in January 2021. Though Guaido had been recognized by over 50 countries as interim president since the disputed re-election of Maduro in 2018, the EU stated in January that its countries could no longer legally recognize Guaido as interim president since he lost his position as head of the National Assembly (despite the EU not recognizing the vote itself). He is still recognized as interim president by the US and the UK, but overall, the opposition continues to lose traction as their leading politicians flee and Maduro's party gains more control (however illegitimate it may be) over the government. Secondly, Maduro has shown that sanctions placed on him and his associates, such as the oil and financial sanctions imposed by the US, are futile in trying to oust him. The EU has recently imposed sanctions on 19 more Venezuelan officials and has called for political talks in Venezuela to set up new elections, but there is very little chance that this will have an effect on Maduro's power, at least in the short term. Maduro has further cemented himself as ruling leader, exemplified that foreign efforts to oust him are futile, squashed the opposition for the most part, and has shown no intentions of surrendering or stepping down, making it extremely unlikely that he will cease to be president before April 1st. The only scenario in which he would cease to be president is if he was assassinated, but given that Maduro has control over Venezuelan security forces and has thwarted several assassination attempts in the past, this looks extremely unlikely as well; however, it is possible, which is why I gave a 2% chance of ""yes."" Overall, Maduro has managed to hold onto power for over seven years now through strong opposition and international condemnation, and I, unfortunately, do not predict that changing within a month."
98174,2021-03-03T19:58:51Z,1,[2.0],[2.0],"Maduro has as of late been solidifying his control and placing people he trusts in important government positions. He has successfully thwarted attempts at coups and has suppressed any form of opposition. The United States had placed an oil embargo, with the hopes that it would pressure the President to step down, yet Maduro found a way around the sanctions. He loosened his grip on the private sector allowing for an influx of money. Considering it is March 3rd, and the question asks if he will cease to be president by April 1st, there is little chance of that happening. The only instance where Maduro might ""cease"" to be president is if he is assanited. He has shown no intention of surrendering or stepping down from power."

61016,2021-03-02T12:58:03Z,1,[1.0],[1.0],"Maduro is in a position where there is not much opposition to his presidency both within and outside. In fact, the US has lifted partial sanctions and allowed some US firms to operate. The only major issue is the out-of-stock situation for diesel as a result of the sanctions on the oil-for-diesel exchange. Without any coup ( which failed sometime back), the chances for Maduro to remain in power is very high."
98440,2021-03-02T03:32:53Z,1,[1.0],[1.0],"Since there no elections occurring within the timeframe provided, there are only two ways Nicolas Maduro may be removed from office – through internal coup or external interference. For external interference, the United States would be the most likely country to conduct such activity since they are the only superpower to endorse his exiled opposition, Juan Guaidó, while China and Russia back Maduro and the United Nations has resigned to accepting his authority over the country. Over the last two years there have been at least three reports of violent attempts, either supported by the US government or involving US citizens, to remove Maduro from the presidency. The most recent alleged attempt appears to have occurred in September 2020 when a U.S. citizen was arrested while possessing “a grenade launcher, a submachine gun, suspected plastic explosive material and bundles of dollars” to target oil refineries, although the United States has denied claims that this individual was working on their behalf. President Donald Trump adopted hardline policies towards Venezuela, even insinuating the possibility of invasion, and while President Joe Biden was expected to change direction, he has maintained the same course to a lesser extent – opting for targeted sanctions and humanitarian assistance. Since the Venezuelan military is also backing Maduro, it is highly unlikely an internal coup would find success within the next month. While none of this is completely possible, I would think there is less than a one in ten chance of any further attempt being made to remove Maduro and less than a one in five chance of any such attempt being successful. As a result, I find that there is a 1% chance Maduro is removed from office in the next 31 days only because I cannot go lower without saying it is impossible. Inversely, since President Biden would likely want to avoid risk of sharing the same failures as his predecessor, there is a 99% chance Maduro will retain his post in peace for at least the next 31 days."

He does not want to be viewed as the bad guy and will try to improve conditions for his people to some degree. With the volatility in the country of Venezuela his adaptions to a new American president will give his detractors pause to help build stability in a climate of uncertainty.

93350,2020-11-15T14:10:42Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],Maduro has learnt the lesson of other dictators in that retaining the loyalty of the elite and the armed forces is the most effective method of staying in power unless external forces invade. Maduro’s loyalty is transactional by ensuring the elite are involved and benefit from corrupt activities and senior officers in the army are also part of the government. His government has also used the Covid-19 virus to crack down on any dissident behaviour and further subjugate the citizenry. The pandemic has perhaps hidden the dire economy of Venezuela (for now) as the rest of the world copes and is preoccupied with the downturn. The proposal is that Maduro is safe for now.

He has resisted protests and international pressure and sanctions for 6 years. Pres Trump has been very tough on Venezuela and the Trump administration made it a point to sanction them and charge him with crimes. President elect Biden would consider diplomatic ties. Those may fall through but probably not before April. Bottom line is that America is one of his two biggest threats, Trump admin will be too busy with suing to force him to resign and an incoming Biden admin will not make it a priority in their first 100 days. his other big threat is his own people revolting. Even with protests and an armed revolt I imagine things will not escalate enough by April. I am giving a 10 percent chance and will revise it every few weeks or so."

Although a Biden-Harris Administration may ultimately lead to more international engagement and collective Western diplomatic pressure on issues such as these, it is highly unlikely that could happen soon or even result in change if it did happen soon, especially given Russian, Chinese and Iranian support to the current regime and assistance in skirting Western sanctions."

Burn rate is about one billion per year but I expect that it will increase as the pile dwindles down and providors of supplies raise prices. Oil production is cratering. The OPEC November 2020 Monthly Oil Market Report shows that Venezuela pumped 367,000 barrels of crude oil daily during October 2020 which was 6% lower than September and less than half of the 796,000 barrels pumped daily for 2019. The largest efknery blew up so they can not refine the crude they have. So they illefally ship via iran and russian tankers as mch as they can bjt that is like sipping thru a straw. The venezuelans are too busy surviving to revolt. But he needs to keep paying the military. So it is a race to run down the reserves. When the cash reserves run out he will be toppled. For Maduro The cost of relinquishing power will always exceed the benefit of sanctions relief. . If Biden holds the sanctions regime maduro will be forced out. Alternatively holding sanctions in place may increase the perceived to Maduro to relinquish power since there wil be no value to remain. But not by April 2021"
