However, the risk of a sharp slowdown in the coming months heightened, amid widespread COVID-19 lockdowns, a prolonged downturn in the property sector, and uncertainty from the war in Ukraine. Meantime, separate data on March activity showed retail sales fell 3.5% YoY, down for the 1st time since July 2020, and worse than market expectations. Analysts say that April data will likely weaken further, dragged down by strict restrictions in the financial hub of Shanghai."

This is expected to exacerbate the slowdown caused by recurrent COVID-19 outbreaks in some places and related lockdowns in parts of China which have disrupted supply chains and significantly weakened household and business activity. Following a strong 8.1 percent rebound in 2021, the World Bank expects China's growth to slow to 4.3 percent this year. This rate of growth is below the economy's potential－the sustainable growth rate of output at full capacity.Our forecast reflects the sharp deceleration in activity in the second quarter of 2022 that took place despite policy actions to cushion the economic slowdown. With the easing of pandemic controls in Shanghai and Beijing, and barring any major COVID-19 outbreaks, growth momentum is expected to rebound in the second half of 2022, helped also by additional policy stimulus announced by the State Council, China's Cabinet, last month.
