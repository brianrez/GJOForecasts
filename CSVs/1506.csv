"Before 1 July 2018, will Waymo launch a driverless transportation service open to the public?",2017-11-17T18:00:54Z,2018-03-13T17:00:09Z,Yes,"['Yes', 'No']",['Technology'],547,654,370,237,"Alphabet's self-driving car company, Waymo, recently announced the testing of its driverless vehicles in Arizona and the planned launch of a driverless transportation service (Medium, Wired, Bloomberg, Ars Technica). A service offered to participants in Waymo's Early Rider Program (Waymo) will count. The presence of a safety operator inside the vehicles does not impact the resolution of this question, as long as that operator is not in the driver's seat. Confused?

A Ford spokesman had an interesting caveat but it was minor and I discounted it because The Chrysler Pacifica and its 84 mpg got Waymo's business. Ford also didn't mention Waymos partnership for fleet services with AVIS. This brought up the American business cycle which shows no signs of collapse in the next couple quarters. Chrysler's Pacifica has anomalous sales figures for November and December, Avis report to Barclays Bank revealed beautiful synergies for the immediate and long term potentials. Can you imagine WAYMO shuttles at AVIS airport rentals to smooth out rental peaks? Avis is already working with AMAZON ALEXA, ALexa and Google HOME, are selling well, Google a device per second since October. Of course we have phones too. Everything seems to be moving lockstep. Waymo seems to be moving in 6 month increments, I'd guess MAY 1st.

Waymo has already been providing limited rides to the public since August during its initial beta test.

They are already removing shadow drivers from some vehicles. It will not take long to determine the safety of these new conditions so they will want to ramp up the number of users soon. Half a year is about right, so they will start the new service for their Early Rider Program next May, 2018."
