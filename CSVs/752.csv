Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that, “The committee’s view on negative rates really has not changed. This is not something that we’re looking at.” He has called for fiscal support for the economy, and has noted that the state of the economy is closely tied to how the government responds to the Pandemic. Given the rhetoric, it seems unlikely that the Fed will make the unprecedented move to cut rates even more, especially when there are other tools (such as fiscal support/mask mandates/social-distancing measures) that can have drastic impacts. Nevertheless I gave a 5% probability that the fed funds rate will be lower because of the potential for continued economic downturn. At this time, Congress seems unwilling to extend Unemployment Insurance benefits. Without renewed benefits the economy may worsen dramatically. If this occurs, and if by December the prospect of a vaccine seems far off, the Fed may seem compelled to take drastic action. The Crisis is, after all, the worst downturn the US has seen since the Great Depression. I gave a 0 probability for it being higher because Jerome Powell has said they are not even thinking about thinking of raising rates at this time. This seems genuine, given the Fed's commitment to forward guidance and the uncertain economic outlook."
