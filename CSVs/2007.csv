73,2016-12-31T19:30:41Z,54,[100.0],[0.0],"Couldnt have gotten this more wrong if I had tried. Was optimistic very early on, that ISIS would not stand and fight, despite @scholarandcat sage advice. https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/91404. I knew they were digging in, but thought that was for a certain amount and key leaders would keep leaving ---->https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/101045. I wrongly thought the US forces would play a larger role in the liberation -----> https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/105631. And despite @Amir- giving me the gameplan https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/127756, which I did then reduce to 51% on https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/130659, it wasnt a matter of days before I was lured back into optimism by what I thought would be some sort of popular uprising by the residents --->https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/139624 which kept getting reinforced ----> https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/146998. @JP pretty much humiliated me with forecast of how it would play out ---->https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/155871, whereby I was convinced isis wouldnt stand and fight, there would be some uprising and that the residents would flee and US would be more heavily involved, @JP gave me the real version and I ignored it. I got the number of fighters horribly wrong https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/320003, thinking less than 4000. As it stands now, seems over 2500 killed and they are still strong in their resolve which I also got wrong. I kept getting the uprising wrong https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/325505. I kept getting the number of fighters wrong and their resolve https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/356859, I kept getting the importance of a political will push to the centre of Mosul for a claim of retaking the city wrong, despite @Dima-K making that clear I was wrong too ----> https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/377694. Even up to early November I thought there would be a collapse of ISIS and a big push to claim the city is some way, https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/377824. I realised I was toast mid to end November https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/387690. I put this q in the Brexit category in that I am so biased even now I think they sh/could have taken Mosul in the timeframe but just got the plan very wrong. So this q has really been a lesson for my forecasting and where I have political will biases over real world complexities even when the odds are high and an ultimate win is inevitable. The battle for Mosul has made me worried that we could see an ISIS retaking mosul in some period when there are not the 100,000 fighters backed by US and airforce etc.."

All of these sputtering - stop and start assaults lose momentum, allowing D'eash to regroup and reset ambushes in front of the assault force direction or axis of operations.

""We must continue to advance because we suffer fewer casualties than if we hold still and wait for other units to advance in their sectors,"" said Brig. Gen. Haider Fadhil of the special forces. ""We are trying to advance cautiously to minimize casualties, and we are convinced that we will eventually be asked to liberate the western sector of the city when we are done here."" That may be a while yet. The special forces have driven IS militants from about 15 of eastern Mosul's estimated 39 neighborhoods, some of which are no more than a handful of blocks. Their progress to date places them about 3 kilometers (nearly 2 miles) from the Tigris River, which divides the city in half. The 16th Infantry Division met stiff resistance about 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the city and has had to halt its advance and hold its positions. IS also appears to use its own drones to gather intelligence on troop movements. An example of their information-gathering abilities came Thursday, when fighters accurately hit with several mortar rounds a tent near the airstrip outside the town of Tal Afar, west of Mosul. The attack took place just minutes after the prime minister concluded a meeting there with leaders of the Shiite militias tasked with liberating Tal Afar. http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/iraq-militarys-limits-are-showing-in-the-drawn-out-battle-for-mosul?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Early%20Bird%20Brief%2011.29.2016&utm_term=Editorial%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief"

The indication that the insurgent forces will fall back to a river line defensive position, may just backfire assuming that the Allied forces employ a double envelopment movement, trapping the insurgents at the river. If it happens this way, I believe that the insurgents will conduct a last ditch effort battle, resulting in a massacre of the local Mosul inhabitants.

He will tell his colleagues that despite stiff resistance from IS fighters in outlying villages, the multi-pronged envelopment of Iraq’s second-biggest city is on schedule, and that operations will soon begin to enter Mosul itself. Few doubt the mission will succeed, but Mr Carter is also determined to push ahead with an assault on Raqqa, the Syrian town that is the capital of the self-styled caliphate. However, it is still far from clear what mix of Syrian rebel and Kurdish fighters will make up the ground forces America and its allies will need to take and hold Raqqa, or what role Russia will try to play ---------------------- COMMENT: As this short article from The Economist Espresso says, Mosul will be retaken, other issues will emerge, but then Raqqa will be taken too."

If these reports are true ISIS could be planning to just fade away in Mosul or just leave a few suicide groups behind. But much of this is likely be untrue. The complications of the anti-ISIS forces having conflicting aims and loyalties would suggest that these force will have to move forward very slowly to avoid each other. There will the problem of which ever anti-ISIS force moves fastest is likely to take the brunt of ISIS resistance.

Consequently, although the ISF will lead the operations into the city proper, they will need to cooperate with the Kurdish Peshmerga, who hold the majority of terrain surrounding the city. However, the Peshmerga participating in anti-ISIS operations will likely exploit the opportunity to take control of areas by displacing Sunni Arabs from their homes, as they did following operations in Sinjar in November 2015."

What can be said with certainty is that the liberation of Mosul will be a multi-phased operation. First the logistical base for the operation must be established at Qayyarah airbase. This is also the collecting point for the Iraqi forces that will liberate Mosul. The next phase will be a multi-pronged advance on the outskirts of Mosul. This phase will unfold in fits and spurts: one day 10 miles will be gained easily, another day there will be tough fighting at an IS strongpoint or a pause to bring up supplies. During November and December the main battle will likely begin. But for the Iraqi and coalition forces the issue of civilians will be a tricky factor."""

While the previous comment about the battlefield geometry of Mosul are valid, increased coalition support can overcome rivers when your side air assault capability and the enemy does not. I'm making the large assumption that ""retaking"" Mosul doesn't necessarily mean that you have quelled all violence. Retaking means that all area that were controlled by ISIS are now controlled by the Iraqi Government and that fighting can continue with unconventional forces. Retaking is a far cry from the military definition of secured. This translate to my military speak as ""seized."" Potential for violence will continue to exist long after this city is ""retaken."""

The US seems to be knocking out some IS positions. The number of IS fighters in Mosul is said to be estimated at only 2 or 3 thousand. This sounds like a lot of progress and sounds like Mosul could soon be recaptured. But the Iraqi army have disappointed many times, it is in the nature of the culture to exaggerate. Maybe this time they will drive out IS, but maybe the progress is being made in towns that IS has abandoned. I don't see any compelling reason why the Kurds would want to capture Mosul. They would be considered occupiers by the population, which would not be conducive to peace, so unless someone (the US. the Iraqi government) has made the Kurds a great offer to act as mercenaries I don't see them shedding blood for Mosul. What IS plans to do is unknown (to me) if they really have only a few fighters in Mosul it might make sense for them to just disappear and leave Mosul. In which case Mosul could be retaken very easily and quickly. Offset against that possibility is the reality of how long it is taking for the Syrian government to capture Aleppo (I am aware that IS is not the group that is defending Aleppo). Maybe the local residents of Mosul are not quite as afraid of the Iraqi government as the residents of Aleppo are afraid of Syrian government, but wars in this part of the world usually involve a lot of retribution."

Only a 101% commitment and iron resolve will succeed. Quotidian monitoring is required for future forecast adjustments.

When I watch the television news in the evening all I see is helpless people waving their arms and squealing that 'X was radicalised' as if nothing can be done. Fixing this goes back to the originator of the 'idea' Abn Al- Wahhab. He was obviously thinking of the Protestant Reformation in 1517 - which proposed the elimination of 'intermediate' beings (angels, Mary etc) between God and man. Step back to the Carolingian era - The Holy Roman Empire I which dominated Western Europe for centuries... The Kings of Europe were SUBSERVIANT to God's representative on earth - in this case the Pope in Rome. While it worked at times it produced human suffering and tyranny. Abd Al- Wahhab proposed that Muslims are subject to God and not man .. but subsequent followers proposed that a man was needed to whom Governments would be subservient - A CALIPH who would, like Popes in times past, be Gods representatives on earth.

This will make re-infiltration easier. A decisive defeat in Syria may make ISIL less tenacious.

With ISIS's dependency on crude trafficking well documented, their fate in Mosul literally rides on the oil premiums fueling their military assets. Assuming this year's Brent uptrend continues— finishing 2016 at ~ $75—and a crude/consensus delta ratio of ~66, we get consensus probability of ~4% (0.4-((75-51)/66). A quarterly standard deviation of ~$5/bbl around the EOY target puts consensus probability as high as 11% at $70, and <= 0% at $80. This provides a compelling framework for high level players, particularly those more capable of influencing oil prices (than military operations)."

The Iraqi PM has expressed his desire (requirement) to have Mosul liberated by the end of the year.

I believe that this US political desire is a red-herring and that US military personnel and planners are merely supporting the Iraqi desire to liberate Mosul. Despite pleas from the international community, the Iraqi's will be force to employ their militia if they want to retake Mosul. This employment will repeat the failures associated with the seizure of Ramadi earlier this year. If Iraqi militia forces begin to move north in earnest, I think we can assume that is a trigger for a broader offensive. The recent capture of some villages east of Mosul is inconsequential to the larger effort, but serves as indication of a broad front slowly beginning to engage ISIS in the north. If coordination between Kurdish and Iraqi forces begins, then we should know that a major offensive is going to occur. Its success will be inevitable, its aftermath, most likely a humanitarian nightmare as Iraqi will ignore the international community and not allow for post-capture concerns to affect their timelines."

Some are being used as human shields. Some were shot, others blown up, and there are reports that IS burned some alive. Adding to their misery is suspicion. Civilians previously fleeing IS were considered victims; the people of Mosul have been living under IS for more than two years and are seen by some as collaborators. Conflicting political objectives of the Baghdad government, the Kurdish Regional Government, and the pro-Sunni former governor of Ninewa, where Mosul is located, have complicated the operation. “The unstable relationship (between) the central government in Baghdad and the local government will have a main role in creating conflicts,” one Iraqi analyst with a local non-governmental organization working on Mosul told VOA. “The conflict between the political parties on power [sharing] will also have a negative role on social integration after the liberation of Mosul,” the analyst said, asking to remain anonymous. Iraq’s complex political and military divisions mean that the area around Mosul has been “divided” into four quadrants through which civilians would have to travel. Each has its own mix of military and civilian authorities, and its own unique and specific protection issues."

Mosul is a big city with a large Shunni population. Capturing Mosul at a cost of many civilian casualties would not be an attractive legacy for Obama, The US will not want to get into the sort of operation that that the Syrian Government, Iran and Russia are involved in in trying to capture Aleppo. I don't think Obama or most Americans would want to see on their TVs the sort of destruction that has happen in Aleppo, being done by US air strikes on Mosul. To the north of Mosul are Kurdish Peshmerga forces, to the South are the (Shia) Iraqi government and army, which is unpopular (or hated) by most Sunnis. So even if ISIS is driven out of Mosul the (Sunni) inhabitants are not necessarily going to welcome their ""liberation"". This would mean likely mean that a post ISIS Mosul would be a de facto (largly) Sunni city occupied by ""foreign"" (e.g. Shias, Kurds) forces. After 15 years experience I don't think that the old neo-cons idea that ""liberated"" Iraqis immediately embrace the ideals of western democracy and live in peace and harmony, has many supporters. So my conclusion is that for the Kurds, the US (and allies) and the Iraqi government there are more reasons to avoid a blood bath in Mosul than there are reasons to try for a quick victory. Why in spite of this I still think there is a chance of Mosul ceasing to be held by ISIS is that non-ISIS Sunnis from within or without Mosul could throw ISIS out. Then the argument might be how Islamic are these Sunnis?"

Now I am low on this because - Recently, the Shia militia group Asa’ib Ahl Al Haq uttered a cryptic warning if the peshmerga participate in the liberation of Mosul — while insisting its own forces would hasten the victory. “We warn against the approval of peshmerga participation in the Mosul liberation,” said Jawad Al-Tibawi, military spokesperson of the Asa’ib Ahl Al Haq, according to Summaria News. “And participation of the Hashd [Shia militias] will help the operation by making the victory faster.” The statement comes not long after radical Shia cleric Moqtada Al Sadr told his followers that they should consider American and British troops helping Iraqi forces take Mosul as “invaders” and “targets.” https://warisboring.com/shia-militias-keep-undermining-the-campaign-for-mosul-d1aa5f92e0fe?mc_cid=6b032ca10c&mc_eid=0467f21653#.nrmmx0x4e"

I'd be silly to not adapt my thinking to a well-considered argument in a situation (such as this) where I have no special insight or access to privileged information. I'm not going anywhere near the forecast of @RiseToVoteSir, however, because I do continue to believe that: a) there is no real ""physical"" barrier to accomplishment of the mission (only 4421 jihadist fighters), which situation will continue; b) that what will be determinative is a matter of moral commitment to achieve the objective; and c) the local population, including the PMUs, may perceive it to be in their best interest to demonstrate this commitment irrespective of any coalition planning. Mosul is like a block of wood sitting on a table. It's just sitting there, waiting to be knocked over. There is a (psychological) battle bubbling below the surface: Who is in control of the anti-ISIS operations anyway? The coalition or the Iraqi government? The Iraqi government has staked out an objective (before the end of the year), and therefore their future credibility must be, in some way, correlated with the achievement of this objective. I am not as confident as, I perceive @RiseToVoteSir in being, that it is the coalition planning that will determine the outcome. I am of the opinion that the Iraqi's have their own agenda, and that since the taking of Mosul is ""as easy as knocking a block of wood off a table,"" it might be their motivation and commitment that will prevail."

This includes the chilling preparations being made to defend it against the onslaught they know will come. “From here we can watch them and so we know they are ready. They know that we will attack so they are building their defences. They are pouring oil everywhere, which they will set alight. “They will put themselves in civilian positions and use civilians like shields. They will hide behind them. And they are also digging tunnels. Many tunnels. We can hear the sound of IS digging underground from here.” In May, Peshmerga soldiers were amazed to find a network of tunnels ranging for miles under the village of Khurbadan, some 40 miles from Mosul. The tunnels linked trenches that boasted machine gun placements, sniper positions and mortar pits. Some extended as deep as 26ft, housing makeshift field hospitals, sleeping quarters and prayer rooms stacked with Korans. The tunnels had all been booby trapped by retreating IS fighters."""

If Mosul is ""retaken"" from the Islamic State, many fighters will just fade into the background from whence they came, to re-emerge under a different banner later on. (Others will go to Libya; many already have.) The citizens of Mosul do not want to be under the control of the Iraqi government. An invasion by the Iraqi Army would be a bad idea. The powers that be in the US seem to recognize this, but what are they going to do about it?"

Baghdad would want to carve out its niche and connect it to Anbar as a buffer against further gains by Syrian Kurds to the west - hence its interest in taking Fallujah first then Mosul.

Last week, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance announced plans to liberate Raqqa from the terrorist group. On Tuesday, the SDF, with assistance from a US-led international coalition, launched an offensive to free the northern part of the Syrian province. ""Since the assault on Raqqa is carried out by the SDF, it makes sense that after its recapture, the city will become a part of the democratic federal system created by us in northern Syria,"" Hassou told RIA Novosti. The Syrian government cannot do anything to oppose the city joining the Kurdish federal system, as ""the Syrian army failed to do something with the terrorists in Raqqa,"" Hassou said. He noted that the Syrian army was not taking part in the offensive to retake Raqqa. Syrian Kurds announced the creation of a federal region in the country's north – the Federal Democratic System of Rojava and Northern Syria – at a conference in Hasakah province on March 17. The initiative was criticized by the Syrian government. Since 2013, Raqqa has been held by the terrorist group Daesh, which is outlawed in the United States and Russia. It has served as the group's de facto capital and witnessed countless atrocities. http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/syria/2016/syria-160526-sputnik02.htm?_m=3n%2e002a%2e1728%2elo0ao02gx5%2e1l7e"

If Islamic State members see their struggle as purely existential, without any safety in disarmament or prospect for amnesty, then fighting to the death is the optimal strategy. Following the loss of territory, surviving fighters will go underground (especially those recruited locally) or move to other nations (more likely for foreign fighters). In either case, Islamic State militants will continue to kill their opponents and destabilize communities where they operate.

There's a big difference between a grandfather and some child going to market with a dozen goats, and a caravan of fifty or so fighters driving modern trucks with heavy machine guns in the back and adorned by black flags. Such ISIS fighters should always be extremely vulnerable after they have identified themselves in an attack and are withdrawing. ISIS fighters should be tagged with drones during an attack, kept under continuous surveillance, and eliminated with air power or drone guided artillery as they disengage.

ISIS numbers in Iraq are falling. This suggests there is a chance that Mosul will be retaken.

The uptick in American fighting forces — and the decision to put them closer to the front lines — is designed to help Iraqi forces retake the key northern city of Mosul, and to help retake Raqqa, the extremist's group self-proclaimed capital in Syria. Last June the Obama administration announced that hundreds of troops would be deployed to help the Iraqis retake Ramadi — a goal they accomplished at the end of the year.""

Doctrine (Army Infantry School - TRADOC Command) uses certain ratio's for planning operations. One is that the defender has a built in 3-1 advantage, and in an urban environment that is a 5-1 advantage. There's reason therefore to see need for up to 50,000, but lets say that the the Fist to Arm (support troops required to feed and arm each fighter) ratio is not 5 to 1 as is the case for an expeditionary force but only 3-1 because of the home field advantage - then total force required is a 200,000 strong task force. Thats' just for everyone's consideration and sorry Air Force types - you can pound ground but you can't hold ground,(Air Cav excepted) and American force multipliers only work if the forces on the ground know how to call for and use them. As Anneinaks comment mentions many of the smaller towns encountered were easily taken on the road to Mosul, but subsequently lost and this demonstrates the basic need to leave a force in place to defend ground freshly taken from counter attack."

""Mosul will be a different nut than all the other cities to crack. I do not see how the Iraqi Forces are in any way ready to start a major offensive."" Farther south, the Iraqi forces have been more successful. The Anbar provincial capital of Ramadi was liberated from ISIS late last year, and with the assistance of coalition airstrikes, it has been estimated that the Islamic terrorist group has lost over 40 percent of the land it once held in Iraq. The liberation of Ramadi came at a cost, as much of the city was demolished by the onslaught of Iraqi troops and by fleeing ISIS fighters. National and coalition forces are hoping toavoid the destruction of Mosul. For those trapped inside Mosul, hope for liberation has been put on hold. On Tuesday, some 18 civilians were executed by ISIS after being charged with ""collaborating with the Baghdad government,"" a day after the group publically slaughtered 14 of its own fighters under similar accusations. Indicators i look for are details about what started the rout = Did Commanders order an organized retreat - did the soldier fall back to a rally point or doff civies and melt into the population, were the comms up, was the ammo supply sufficient, and was there sufficient training to call for for fire and if so was that fire accurate etc."

Sunni and Peshmerga brigades are being trained and pre-positioned on the outskirts of Mosul, supported by US Marines and air power. The ""offensive"" you hear about is essentially clearing a perimeter around the bases where the troops are stationed so that they are not vulnerable to rocket and mortar attack from ISIS. The villages being cleared are also the pathway into Mosul. However, these villages will now need to be patrolled (kept clear) and there will undoubtedly be IEDs and ambushes to contend with. The key to the conquest of Mosul is going to be buying off some of the locals and perhaps a few ISIS leaders (some of the locals and a few of the ISIS leaders cooperated with the Anbar awakening projects with the Sunni tribes and US troops back in 2007-2008). Money and ""strong horses"" talk in Iraq (if you believe the strong horses will win you might as well take the money and turn to their side). The money is there, but the horses are not yet strong enough (the Sunnis doubt the US commitment to squelching Iranian influence and death squads in Iraq and to crushing the Islamic State- for good reason.......and this probably won't change as long as the US President is giving interviews where he mocks the concept of foreign policy credibility). I am reducing my probability somewhat as the Iraqi Sunni troops are not ready, there is political pressure to de-emphasise the Peshmerga (Kurds and Mosul a highly charged combination) and sectarian militias and the US has shown no appetite to lead the fight (though President Obama might be ""all in"" if there is a Tango competition at the Ninawa International)"

Pollack traveled to Iraq from March 9 to March 19 with Michael Knights of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. They had extensive meetings in Baghdad, Sulaymaniyyah, and Erbil with Iraqi, Kurdish, American, and British officials. This is the first of a three-part survey on the situation in Iraq. ... There are indications that the morale of Da’esh fighters in Fallujah and Mosul is growing somewhat fragile, with Da’esh commanders worrying that their troops will neither attack nor defend as strenuously as they once had. As further evidence of problems, Da’esh is increasingly shifting both new recruits and experienced cadre from Iraq-Syria to Libya. ... Baghdad’s announcement that the liberation of Mosul has begun is a bit premature. As has been widely reported, Iraqi forces are pushing toward Qayyarah West airfield, west of the Tigris river south of Mosul. Qayyarah West can then serve as a logistical hub and staging base for a more deliberate assault toward Mosul somewhat later. Assuming that the Iraqis and the coalition continue to prioritize the liberation of Mosul over finishing off the Da’esh strongholds along the Euphrates valley, and barring some unforeseen development that hamstrings the Iraqis or revives Da’esh’s fortunes, it is entirely possible that Mosul could fall in the next 6 to 12 months. ... ...the intelligence suggesting the fragility of Da’esh’s forces in Mosul—and the convergence of all manner of Iraqi, coalition and regional forces around Mosul—raise the possibility that Da’esh forces there might implode or flee before the coalition is ready to take the city deliberately."""

The U.S. has said it will take many months to prepare Iraqi forces for such a long and complicated offensive."" Comments: Ground offensive has started. Areas around Mosul will be taken first. IS counterattacks expected. Additional clip: ""Defense Secretary Ash Carter has said the U.S. is looking at a number of options to “accelerate” the fight against IS. Those options are still under discussion in the Pentagon and have not yet officially been submitted to the White House for approval. The range of options could include sending additional U.S. forces to Iraq, using Apache helicopters for combat missions, deploying more U.S. special operations forces or using American military advisers in Iraqi units closer to the front lines."" Comments: Expanded US combat support for Mosul offensive highly probable. This will change the order of battle and deserves consideration. Incremental adjustment up."

Only recently, Iraqi and U.S. officials refrained to give a specific time on when the Mosul operation could begin, saying it would take many months to prepare Iraq's still struggling military for the long-anticipated task of retaking the key city. Some U.S. and Iraqi officials have said it may not even be possible to retake it this year, despite repeated vows by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. http://www.military.com/daily-news/2016/03/24/iraq-says-its-launched-offensive-to-recapture-is-held-mosul.html?ESRC=eb_160324.nl You may remember from my previous post that the all US base manned by Marines (2,000 - thats a lot of fire power but not enough for force protection AND an operation)the name of the nearby town - clear the areas between Makmour and the adjacent Qayara area to the east of the Tigris River, and to cut one of the supply lines to the nearby Shirqat area. Last summer, Marines and special operations forces collaborated to re-open Al-Taqaddum Air Base to the southeast in Anbar province, Iraq. The base, another remnant from Operation Iraqi Freedom, allowed U.S. troops to move into position near the population center of Ramadi, which had been overtaken by Islamic State fighters. Iraqi troops successfully reclaimed Ramadi in December. At Al-Taqaddum, more than 300 Marines from the crisis response task force provide security and support while a much smaller element of about two dozen Marines works directly with Iraqi military leaders to provide mentorship and advising. A spokesman for Marine Corps Central Command, Maj. Brad Avots, confirmed that the Marine Corps force strength at these bases remained steady even as the new outpost opened. The Marine Corps presence in Iraq also extends beyond conventional forces. Earlier this year, a Marine Corps colonel with Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command took charge of the staff element for Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-Iraq, marking the first time MARSOC had formed and deployed a full joint special operations task force staff. That task force, which operates out of an undisclosed location in country, oversees special operations troops from every service."

Fewer than 200 Marines have deployed to the fire base, located near the northern Iraqi town of Makhmur, to protect U.S. advisers and Iraqis who are stationed at a nearby Iraqi military base. The base is part of the U.S.-led coalition's efforts to prepare Iraqi combat forces for the fight to retake Mosul. ""This is the first time that we've established a spot that's only American,"" Col. Steve Warren, a coalition spokesman, told reporters from Baghdad. ""All of this movement has been done at the invitation of the Iraqi government.""

As discussed, the area is very rural which will make it difficult to secure long-term gains and some level of ISIS penetration in and through the area is likely to remain an issue for the Iraqi government. Even short-term security may be difficult — much of the ISF training has been focused on urban combat and security; military commanders admitted that the force intended to secure and police the area was still undergoing training for rural combat environments after announcing that ISIS was defeated in the region. That will likely mean that ISF units, possibly the C-T units, will be bogged down securing a large area without the training to do so. That could significantly slow progress for other offensives, as all major Iraqi drives (Tikrit, Baiji, and Ramadi) have been led by the C-T units.""https://medium.com/@roberthatem/isf-in-greater-anbar-march-12-1219c27c5e2c comment: Although far from Mosul and only loosely related to the troop buildup going on there, two things to highlight from the article: First, the close relationship between rural and urban military operations, fluidity and difficulty to hold rural areas around a city may both delay Mosul operation (understood as taking city center) and/or allow unexpected resilience from what remains of ISIS there. Second, though taking city center is a priority, experience from long Fallujah operation seems to be take city periphery and rural belt slowly before attempting center.

In that I recorded the Fallujah to Mosul reinforcement, and no story has reported on where any additional troops came from, I am sticking with my estimate until I find a good reason to change. There's obviously a lot of uncertainty in these numbers. For example, it looks like the same fight had both 15 and 100 jihadists reported as killed. In such cases as this, I will report the lower number. I also don't know how far ""in Mosul"" extends. I'm looking for whatever number of jihadists there will be consolidated in the city proper when the coalition assault begins. My understanding is that the immediate suburbs (outskirts) have been vacated by ISIS, but that they still have pockets farther out south and west and attack outward in all directions. I'm trying to avoid double-reporting and to be overly conservative with this estimate."

It is likely Shaddadi will be captured first causing a separation between Mosul and Raqqa making it easier for it to be attacked. The taking of Shaddadi will be good indicator on the progress towards Mosul so if nothing has happened by September I think it highly unlikely Mosul will be taken by Jan. Additionally I feel the international assistance will likely increase this year as the refugee crisis becomes unmanageable and the only option is to take back Syria and Iraq. However as the saying goes no plan survives first contact with the enemy so things can always go wrong in war which is why I have reduced my estimation from my estimate.

Emerging news coming out of theater appear to support the assumption that IS forces in Mosul are rapidly degrading to a level that would translate to high confidence of an Iraqi offensive starting mid-year (or earlier) and a successful recapture of the city prior to the expiration of this IFP. Personally, I believe that would be great, as the good Iraqi people in the city have suffered enough. I would have no problem if every single jihadist POS in Mosul is taken out. Find. Fix. Finish. However, 15 + years of US military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan tells me to be cautious here. War is fluid and unpredictable. Situations can suddenly pivot and bite you in the ass when you think you have a good firm grip on it (that whole Rumsfeld-Shinseki thing keeps playing in my mind). I have listened to enough stories from friends, co-workers and associates who have been in combat to know this to be a truth (a good bud, ex-USMC, battalion-level IO; Beirut, Panama, HIDTA border ops, stint in NSA, had a couple of wild ones that were pretty 'entertaining', to say the least).

Iraqi security forces need to secure the area around Ramadi and Hit to increase the buffer zone around Baghdad and this requires a prominent presence and the painstaking task of clearing out remaining pockets of resistance. This will take time. Furthermore, ISIL has recently taken control over a stretch of highway between Tikrit and Kirkuk. This highlights the fact that an offensive on a city as far north as Mosul will require security of supply lines and efforts to minimize gaps that would facilitate ISIL counter-attacks. Mosul is predominately Sunni, and this requires a delicate and patient approach to free a city inhabited by people that are weary of the Shiite militias and the Shia dominated central Iraqi government. Kurdish forces, who are closer to the city might be held back by economic hardships brought on by low oil prices and lower budgeting from the Iraqi central government. I am considering raising my prediction percentage in the near future because the KRG is currently in Washington negotiating a deal to acquire more funds. KRG's Peshmerga is an effective fighting force within a much better striking position to retake Mosul. If they acquire the needed funds (the KRG has not been able to pay Peshmerga fighters since late 2015) they might find the morale and economic strength to take back the 3rd largest city of Iraq. Iraqi government and Shiite militias will have a much harder time making their way north and gaining the trust of the Mosul population. Furthermore, it seems ISIL is shifting focus to other areas, most notably Libya. This could be construed as a sign of weakness on their part, and an effort to metastasize to other areas that are easier for pseudo- want-to-be-governments to maintain control."

The defense minister also said Baghdad currently has no plans to ask Russia for airstrikes on Islamic State targets in Iraq. The statements come nearly a month after the Iraqi military, with support from the U.S.-led coalition, dislodged the Islamic State from the city of Ramadi. Gauging from Iraqi offensives in Ramadi, Baiji and Tikrit, the operation to cut off and then recapture Mosul is going to be slow, deliberate and greatly aided by coalition airstrikes."

The so-called Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS) troops ""are the best light infantry the Iraqis have,"" said Sen. Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island and the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said of the CTS troops. But, the senator added, they risk being worn out by overuse. The elite forces recently led the way in taking back Ramadi from militants affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS and earlier spearheaded the offensive to recapture Tikrit when conventional Iraqi troops and Shia militias backed by Iran failed. They held on at the Baiji oil refinery when others fled and recently routed ISIS in fighting near Haditha in western Anbar province, according to U.S. and Iraqi officials. ""They are beginning to prepare for other efforts to retake territory"" from ISIS, said Reed, who recently returned from Iraq and meetings with U.S. and Iraqi commanders. ""One of the major objectives is Mosul,"" he said, but ""that's probably months and months away"" in the campaign against ISIS. Joint Chiefs Chairman Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford said the U.S. was looking at ways to speed up the timeline for commencing operations in Mosul. In Paris on Sunday, Dunford told reporters traveling with him that he will soon make recommendations to President Barack Obama on the possible repositioning of U.S. troops in northern Iraq to aid an assault on Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. ""We're about winning"" and ""we want to have the Iraqis win,"" he said. The repositioning would involve placing U.S. advisors closer to Mosul than the Joint Operations Center in Irbil, capital of the Kurdish autonomous region, according to a Defense Department news release. ""It is fair to say we will have positions -- we already do (in Irbil) -- up in the north that will facilitate supporting Iraqi security forces as they isolate Mosul,"" Dunford said after meetings with Gen. Pierre de Villiers, chief of France's defense staff. For the Iraqi Security Forces, the push north from Baiji up the Tigris River valley to Mosul will require more Iraqi troops and more U.S. soldiers to train them for a major operation, Army Col. Steve Warren, a spokesman for Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve, said in a briefing to the Pentagon from Baghdad last week. ""Hundreds, not thousands"" of additional U.S. troops will have to be deployed for the training assignment, he said. ""The reason we need new trainers or additional trainers is because that's really the next step in generating the amount of combat power needed to liberate Mosul."" Warren added, ""We know we will need more (Iraqi) brigades to be trained, we'll need more troops trained in more specialties"" to liberate Mosul, the largest city controlled by ISIS. It was impossible to know how many ISIS fighters were defending Mosul, but Warren said the estimates run from 5,000 to 10,000. To take back the city, the second largest in Iraq, ""We think we're going to need, you know, in the neighborhood of eight trained brigades"" of about 3,000 troops each, he said, ""but that's adjustable."" In Ramadi, three brigades of Iraqi Security Forces were used but only after the Counter-Terrorism Service troops cleared the way into the city. The troops threw up a pontoon bridge across the Euphrates River after ISIS militants blew the existing bridges. The elite forces then attacked to the city center, using bulldozers to throw up earth berms on either side of the advance to block ISIS suicide truck bombers on their flanks, Warren said. The Ramadi assault followed a pattern of Iraqi attack -- CTS troops lead the way, conventional ISF forces conduct clearing operations, and Iraqi National Police, and on occasion Sunni tribal fighter, provide continuing security for rebuilding efforts. When Ramadi was retaken, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said that Mosul also would be retaken in 2016. ""We are coming to liberate Mosul, which will be the fatal blow to"" ISIS, he said. In the north, Fuad Hussein, chief of staff of the Kurdish Peshmerga forces, said his troops were ready for the push on Mosul but were awaiting the arrival of the Counter-Terrorism Service and Iraqi Security Forces. ""We had [a] discussion to liberate Mosul last year in March, and now we're in January 2016. So it has been delayed,"" Hussein told the Kurdish Rudaw news service last week. ""The question is why? To be honest it has to do with the Iraqis -- we need a partner."" Hussein praised the professionalism of the elite CTS troops. ""That unit has good fighters and are well organized and has a lot of experience,"" he said, ""So we need them to be with us as partners so that we can jointly, with the American help, liberate Mosul."" Since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, the CTS, which was created by the U.S., has received the most training and the best equipment from the U.S., which recognized their unique role in the Iraqi national security structure as a relatively independent and non-sectarian fighting force. To avoid political influence that plagues other units, the Counter-Terrorism Service reports directly to the prime minister, rather than going through the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Interior. In a paper on the elite troops for the Brookings Institution, retired Army Special Operations Col. David Witty, said, ""Organizations such as CTS are at the heart of U.S. strategies in the Middle East that aim to develop indigenous capacity to combat insurgents and terrorists."" After ISIS invaded Iraq and took Mosul in 2014, ""five of Iraq's 14 Army divisions were rated as ineffective, or had disappeared completely. U.S. advisers rated remaining units as infiltrated with Shia militias and Sunni extremists. At the other extreme, the Counter-Terrorism Service was assessed as the one bright spot of ISF. It was the best military organ,"" Witty said. The elite unit ""was able to maintain its cohesion and effectiveness, despite experiencing some of the most intensive combat, suffering heavy losses, and continuing to be used as a regular, although elite, ISF unit, rather than in a dedicated counter-terrorism role,"" Witty said. In a round table session with reporters earlier this month, Sen. Reed said of the service, ""We need to have capable forces fighting alongside them, and that's the goal, and we are trying to train up those forces now."""

The efforts of a 65-nation coalition and punishing U.S. airstrikes have helped local ground forces roll back gains by the Islamic State. Government forces and Shiite militias, for example, recaptured the city of Tikrit, while Kurdish troops ousted I.S. fighters from the town of Sinjar and other parts of northern Iraq. Last month, Iraqi troops finally pushed Islamic State militants out of most of the city of Ramadi, which the group had held since routing Iraqi forces there last spring. In the wake of all this, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter touted “the kind of progress that the Iraqi forces are exhibiting in Ramadi, building on that success to … continue the campaign with the important goal of retaking Mosul as soon as possible.” Even more recently, he said those forces were “proving themselves not only motivated but capable.” I encountered the same upbeat tone when I asked Col. Steve Warren, a U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad, about the Iraqi security forces. “The last year has been a process of constructing, rebuilding, and refitting the Iraqi army,” he explained. “While it takes time for training and equipping efforts to take effect, the increasing tactical confidence and competence of the ISF [Iraqi security forces] and their recent battlefield successes indicate that we are on track.”"

Since taking the city, ISIS has now had over a year to prepare formidable defenses in a city of 2 million people. Urban warfare is always costly and takes considerable time, so even if an offensive began this spring I think it unlikely it would be over by the end of the year. ISIS is likely to be a formidable foe against an Iraqi Army that has proven itself highly ineffective. There are few other players that seem keen on getting involved that may hasten an ISIS defeat in Mosul. Turkey has not demonstrated any interest in defeating ISIS since its primary concern is the Kurds. And, the Kurds are preoccupied with defending its interests against Turkey, so they would likely only get involved reluctantly. Additionally, neither the American people nor the Obama administration has the willingness to invest the ground forces required to defeat and destroy ISIS. Finally, the wealthy Gulf/Arab countries have done little to date to help defeat ISIS. With all that in mind, there seems to be little willingness or ability among any of the likely players to rush into re-taking Mosul before the end of the year in what would undoubtedly be a costly and brutal campaign."

The recapture of Ramadi does not indicate an improvement in the capacity of Iraqi ground troops that would be required to retake Mosul. Mosul has been under IS control for longer and IS forces are quite well entrenched in the city. The battle for Tikrit (a city a tenth the size of Mosul) took months in planning and several weeks for anti-IS forces to secure. A failed attempt to retake Mosul could have disastrous effects on the already low morale of the Iraqi army which means they are unlikely to attempt it without a high degree of confidence. In order to attempt it the army would likely need to be able to encircle Mosul to cut off supply lines and be able to dedicate a substantial number of troops implying that the situation elsewhere had stabilized to the extent that it is feasible to divert troops. Troops required: The battle of Tikrit involved around 30,000 anti- IS soldiers (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/world/middleeast/iraq-tikrit-isis.html?_r=0). Given that the IS presence in Mosul is more established (though arguably weakened by a lack of funds/troop payment), the city is over 10 times as large as Tikrit, it is located deeper in IS territory making it easier for them to get reinforcements and the central government has been unpopular in the past, Mosul is expected to be a harder fight.

The anti-IS forces can be the Turks, from the north, the Iraqi's from the South, and the Kurds from the east. The US will not act alone because of previous experience and the political environment. The timeline is 11 months. The Iraqi's are preparing to retake Ramadi with US and Ally assistance. That will significantly lower their chance of meeting the deadline. I will give them 5% chance of diverting their forces to the North and successfully dislodging a dug-in force. The Turks are looking more likely to attack IS this year according to Stratfor. However, they appear to be more concerned with Syria than Iraq and the Iraqi Government warned them to keep out of Iraq when they sent in a small security force. They would also need to secure a line of communication (LOC) that is rather exposed. I will give that 5%. Most likely of the three are the Kurd's desire for Mosul. They want the city but Iraq will not let them have it as part of their region. If they try to secure it from IS they are likely to get tepid, if any, support from Baghdad.

Capturing Ramadi was of a different scale - there were only about 300 IS fighters there. It is said that Mosul actually fell to Ba'ath Party supporters as much as IS. So its unclear if fighting would involve many IS (maybe they would just evaporate) or Ba'athists, or just Sunnis. If the IS route to Syria is broken will IS move to Raqqa. It would be quite plausible for Mosul to be left for now and see if Ba'athists try and start talks and claim to have freed Mosul from IS themselves. That could be a face saving outcome to avoid the bloodshed and damage from street to street fighting in a city with a million people.

Iraqi security forces need to secure the Ramadi and Hit to increase the buffer zone around Baghdad and this requires a prominent presence and the painstaking task of clearing out remaining pockets of resistance. This will take time. Furthermore, ISIL has recently taken control over a stretch of highway between Tikrit and Kirkuk. This highlights the fact that an offensive on a city as far north as Mosul will require security of supply lines and a minimizing gaps that allow for ISIL counter-attacks. Furthermore, Mosul is predominately Sunni, and this requires a delicate and patient approach to free a city inhabited by people that are weary of the Shiite militias and the Shia dominated central Iraqi government. Kurdish forces, who are closer to the city might be held back by economic hardships brought on by low oil prices and lower payments from the Iraqi central government. I am considering raising my prediction percentage in the near future because the KDP is currently in Washington negotiating a deal to acquire more funds. KDP's Peshmerga is an effective fighting force within a much better striking position to retake Mosul. If they acquire the needed funds (KDP has not been able to pay Peshmerga fighters since late 2015) they might find the morale and economic strength to take back the 3rd largest city of Iraq. Iraqi government and Shiite militias will have a much harder time making their way north and gaining the trust of the Mosul population. Furthermore, it seems ISIL is shifting focus to other areas, most notably Libya. This could be construed as a sign of weakness on their part, and an effort to metastasize to other areas that are easier for pseudo- want-to-be-governments to maintain control."

Far from marching 400 Km's away from Baghdad, the army may be most needed to simply hold what exists of the current Iraqi State together in and around the capital. Rather than a complex attack on Mosul within a year, it seems to me a strong possibility is growing that the current Iraqi regime may not even exist within that time frame.

But looking at the entire development of this civil war, and the latest successes of the anti-IS-coalitions, I don't think they will march forward with the same speed. Also Mosul is probably the most important holding of the IS and there is lot of status symbol connected to it. So to retake it will take a considerable effort, and I am convinced the coalitions will finally succeed. Also the own dynamics of a series of happenings could trigger other dynamics and fast and huge losses could be the consequence, as we have seen on the opposite side in 2014/15. Considering the set time frame 1. Jan, i still don't think it will be possible, however I have increased my vote towards likely."

The Ramadi ""Victory"" seems delusional to me. A more correct adjective would the Ramadi Destruction. ...the push into Ramadi cannot yet be regarded as decisive. First, it took the Iraqi military seven long months — since May 2015 — to make progress into the central neighborhoods of the city. Since the past summer, with the help of the US Air Force, Baghdad has been repeatedly unable to dislodge IS militants. A state military force deploying the latest weapons, operationally supported by the United States with air cover and, reportedly, ground troops, accompanied by Iran’s top military commanders, US-armed tribesmen and led by vengeful sectarian militias has been haphazardly fighting for more than half a year for a mid-size city 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Baghdad that it should not have lost in the first place and which was seized as an afterthought by a nonstate armed group that had already won the prize in Mosul. Second, since Ramadi has been declared ""liberated,"" IS has stepped up its urban guerrilla tactics with deadly results for the elite Iraqi troops. Observer tribesmen claim that the group still controls a third of the city, and there are reports of neighborhoods with the IS flag flying within a hundred meters of the national troops. In the midst of a devastated city, we are at best looking at a prolonged tit-for-tat phase of factional advance-and-retreat cycles previously witnessed elsewhere, notably in Fallujah. In truth, the price paid by the Iraqi military and the US forces in Ramadi is already too high. The strategy they worked on for the past months is now known to IS, which wasted no time in switching in situ to suicide-attack mode and withdrew its fighters to ""stretch the enemy,"" keeping them in expectation of a possible counterattack. There are already indications of the Iraqi authorities overplaying their hand with statements that IS will be defeated in 2016 and Mosul is next. Finally, and most revealingly, Ramadi is arguably not that important for IS. The group will only be dealt a blow in Iraq when the city of Mosul is brought back under the control of the central government. Until then, all engagements are de facto sideshows... http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/01/iraq-ramadi-illusion-capture-islamic-state-army.html?utm_source=Al-Monitor+Newsletter+%5BEnglish%5D&utm_campaign=cc1106a8f5-January_06_2016&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_28264b27a0-cc1106a8f5-102297633"

In general, it is not in the US best interest to completely oust ISIS, as long as Assad is in the game. This also holds for Russia and Assad as they may divert attention to other rebel groups, so retaking Mosul may delay or even won't take place. A number of oil refineries controlled by ISIS were attacked, so fewer resources available for an offence/defense. Also ISIS may opt for retaking Ramadi rather than defending Mosul since Ramadi lies in the Euphrates river, which the ISIS will want to retake to streamline resource transportation. Fallujah is likely the next battleground, or at least will precede Mosul. If that's the case, resources of all kinds will be diverted from retaking Mosul. (Jan 4th)"

So, the longer a full assault is delayed, the lower the odds of anti-IS forces retaking Mosul in 2016; I should regularly reduce the odds as the year goes by, ceteris parabus. Additionally, Iraqi generals seem to be overly optimistic <http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/06/14/an-iraqi-general-s-plan-to-retake-mosul-is-a-fantasy.html&gt; as do some American officials <http://www.iraqinews.com/iraq-war/liberation-mosul-will-within-months-says-john-allen/&gt;. Let's set a reasonable amount of time for retaking Mosul, after efforts begin in earnest, at a 6 month minimum (see US Army Col Warren's comment <http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-mosul-exclusive-idUSKBN0UC0JP20151229&gt; on patience relative to Ramadi). In order to retake Mosul in 2016, those efforts will have to begin by June. Yet Iraqi forces still need to take Fallujah, where they have stalled <http://www.ibtimes.com/iraqi-forces-capture-ramadi-isis-look-toward-fallujah-mosul-2240563&gt;, after which they will need to regroup before beginning the assault on Mosul. If everything went absolutely perfectly, Mosul might be retaken in December 2016. Perfection is very unlikely, as is the probability of Iraq retaking Mosul before 2017."

'Victory in Ramadi will be measured by time. More importantly, did this tactical action display a proven template for future missions and successes? The Special Forces clearly did a superb job in the training and motivation of these newly disciplined Iraqi forces in Ramadi, yet can this be sustained when preparing for the next logical target—Mosul? Mosul must be the next objective on the actions list, but not at the expense of forfeiting Ramadi, which would halt momentum and destroy morale (casualty numbers from Ramadi are still not confirmed). Mosul is Iraqi’s second largest city and the conquest of the ISIS stronghold (since June 2014) would likely require coordination and direct actions with the Peshmerga. Whether the result in Ramadi is a measurable success or a template for future Iraqi operations, the next step will undoubtedly necessitate a greater commitment from the U.S.'"
14327,2015-12-31T04:26:23Z,1,[30.0],[30.0],"There are several reasons it is less likely that the Iraqi army will be able to retake Mosul before Jan 1, 2017. 1. Ramadi is closer to Baghdad and further from Syria and ISIS ""heartlands."" This means that it would be easier for the Iraqi army to cut supply lines and get its own troops to the area. 2. Mosul is Sunni. The Iraq army is mostly Shia. The Iraqi defence forces that were supposed to stop ISIS simply threw down their weapons and left when ISIS approached. Similarly, Kurds would not have an easy time taking the city and have no interest in taking areas they can't hold. 3. Since Pres. Obama is in office through mid-January 2018, even if a hawk is elected to the White House, short of a black swan event, it is unlikely that US or other foreign troops will be in the area to re-take the city. 4. It took months of preparation and fighting to re-take Ramadi, which had a war-time population of around 70k people. Mosul is much, much larger (600k people). Many of these people may not be fans of ISIS but are even less enchanted by the idea of Americans, Kurds or Sunnis in control."

And the Shia paramilitaries were conspicuously absent. It’s unclear how many — if any — militia fighters participated in the battle. There appears to have been far less than during the pitched battle for Tikrit in March-April 2015, which Shia militias led. The Iraqi army also had support from dozens of U.S. air strikes.

Ultimately, this will result in them becoming a guerrilla group - per the example of Al Qaeda - rather than a geographically definable entity. Many of their leaders are being taken out during air strikes on existing strongholds, which will cause surviving leaders to take refuge in less obvious target areas. Without the demonstrated organisational abilities of these leaders, maintaining a disciplined frontline in their current strongholds will become impossible against larger conventional forces coming into direct conflict in towns like Mosul."

Many of the other commentators have done a good job of analyzing the difficulties the Iraqi Army will have in rapidly shifting from Ramadi to Mosul to take Mosul by 1 Jan. After they finish Ramadi, which will take a few months more to consolidate, the IA will then have to lick its wounds and prepare for the next operation. (and everything will slow down for the summer) While they say that the next operation is Mosul, and the US is certainly pressuring them to go for Mosul, they will have a decision point. There is one strategic factor about this decision point that I have not seen discussed. The Baghdad government has no incentive to remove threats against the Kurds. As soon as the Iraqi Army retakes Mosul, then Barzani and the KRG are safe from the ISIL threat, meaning that they then have fewer constraints on ""misbehavior"" (from Baghdad's perspective): actions that promote KRG independence, just like they were doing before the fall of Mosul. So why would Baghdad sacrifice Shia blood to remove a threat to the KRG before they have to? So it seems doubtful that they will put a lot of pressure from the top to make the operation happen quickly. And to make it happen before 1 Jan 17 would require a lot of command pressure to overcome the Iraqi's army's risk aversion, organizational problems, force generation, overcoming losses, etc. On the other hand, I bumped my prediction back up from a low around 5-10% to account for the non-zero chance of a rapid ISIL collapse (partial or total). War is the realm of chance after all. There are numerous indications of the effects of attrition on ISIL. There are two possible models for this, a rapid ""wild fire"" collapse or a slow fight to the end. Their performance to date would favor the attritional slugfest. However, the complexity of human institutions in violent conflict leads to unpredictable outcomes. Another possibility is an ISIL decision to not contest Mosul, which could lead to an earlier far to the IA. The precedent for this is Tal Abyad, which ISIL chose to not fight for. Not fighting for Mosul would be a much more momentous decision, however, so I do not think this is a high probability outcome, just possible."

Daesh carefully engaged the Sunni and Baathist parties that were disenfranchised by the Maliki Gov't (which I cannot find enough descriptive phrases with which to express their level of incompetency.) What Daesh did do was unite Maliki's enemies, and used Gold before Lead to cement alliances, collecting back the gold later and eradicating competition from those who thought they would co rule with Baghdadi. The Sunni and Baathists who were attracted to IS in the 1st place have still not found satisfaction so will not be eagerly awaiting redemption but rather living in fear of of retribution. Gold is in short supply now though, so black mail will be Daesh's stock in trade to encourage their former allies to help them again lest they be exposed. Never mind that U.S. special forces and Peshmerga await the sympathizing Arab families that might return to Mosul (not).

While we've been reading new stories for months about various planning operations to retake Mosul, tensions between the anti-ISIL forces, such as between the Iraqis & Turks, have stopped any progress. Also, the Iraqis still lack manpower & training to retake the city. However, the Iraqi PM did announce on Dec. 25, 2015 that Mosul is definitely the next major goal. Given the lead time necessary for training & to iron out better terms of co-operation among the coalition - this preparation will take months at a minimum. Then there's the question of fighting the 260 mile distance from Ramadi to Mosul. It's seems possible to do all this in under a year, but just barely, in the best of circumstances. Yet the best of circumstances rarely seem to happen in Iraq. So I'm not going above 50% on this until we see reports of successful troop training & better relations among the coalition."

Still not really seeing convincing arguments on why Mosul should fall and to whom exactly. The motivation isn't there for all parties to cooperate. Kurds are fractured and while destroying ISIS would be welcome, helping the government retake Mosul isn't that great of an incentive for them to unite around and dying is a nuisance. If anything, at the moment defending their positions against ISIS is the low-risk option that's stabilising and provides them with legitimacy which they so-very-crave for their independent state project they've got going on. I'm not saying it's intentional, just that status-quo isn't that bad. I don't see the govenment on it's own to be able to take on Mosul unless the coalition seriously steps up it's support.

Meanwhile the Iraqi forces will build a coalition with Sunni tribal groups, that will lead to the erosion of IS control in areas to the west and south, cutting the remaining supply routes with Raqaa in Syria.
