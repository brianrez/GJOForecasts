The European political landscape is conducive to additional exit activity and could get to the point of at least one additional member state scheduling an exit vote because: 1. ""Leave"" proponents within the UK Conservative party emerged with important new assignments, which can be seen by politically ambitious people elsewhere as validating the proposition that they could be similarly advantaged if they come to the forefront of an exit campaign. 2 . UKIP has proved unable to collect post-referendum political dividends from the UK vote, but politically ambitious people elsewhere can still infer that (a) UKIP and its leaders came far even if they haven't obtained benefits commensurate with the success of their cause, and (b) UKIP's failure to capitalize on the Leave victory is a lesson in how not to do it rather than a sign that such benefits are unattainable. 3. Donald Trump's momentum in the US (and his endorsement of Brexit) offers further encouragement that nationalist, iconoclastic politics are viable. Even if Trump fails to win the general election, politically ambitious people in Europe will still tend to interpret his rise as testifying to the potency of this brand of politics. 4. Further, Donald Trump's success demonstrates that logical concerns about post-election consequences, such as the difficult choices now facing the UK, have limited impact on voters wishing to cast an ""in your eye"" protest vote. 5. Over the next year developments in the pre/early stages of the UK's Article 50 negotiations are 65% likely to encourage exit elsewhere because in the view of Eurosceptics (a) if EU leaders appear accommodative this will reduce the basis for fears of post-exit costs, and (b) if EU leaders appear vindictive and punitive this will aggravate resentment towards Brussels and fuel support for protest. 6. Polling in multiple EU member states shows at least significant minority support for EU exit. 7. General elections in 2016 and 2017 will provide openings for escalating the debate over continued EU membership, e.g., Austria, France, Germany, Netherlands. 8, Developments of the sort that feed exit support are an important prerequisite for getting as far as setting a date for a referendum in the next year. There is 75% potential for one or more such developments in Europe: euro crisis; banking/sovereign debt crisis; recession in Europe; surge of immigrants from the Mideast; increase in terrorist acts by Mideast immigrants."

My immediate picks are 1) Scotland followed by 2) Northern Ireland. Scotland already has a buildup of ill will and a framework in place for withdrawal. The Scots' decision to remain a part of the UK following the 2014 referendum was based heavily upon the ideal of maintaining a healthy trade relationship with Europe. England's growing nationalism and subsequent withdrawal from the EU may be perceived, at best, as a direct threat to the Scots' economic interests; at worst, it may cause them to re-evaluate their decision to remain a part of the UK, thus triggering another voter referendum. David Cameron's exit from the PM seat can only aggravate the situation. Cameron's personal reassurances appeared to play a significant role in keeping proud Scots in the fold. Without power to enforce change, it is hard to believe that Cameron's reassurances, if offered, would be met with much credulity. In the end, I strongly believe that the Scots will seize the opportunity to launch another attempt at withdrawal. In my mind, question isn't if, but when the Scots will brave another go. I expect Northern Ireland, desirous of change, will nonetheless take their cue from their Scottish neighbors; I suspect they will wait and watch, as the new PM is seated and act later rather than sooner."

Austria and Italy may be worth watching, though, as an outside chance. Several of the most overtly EU-sceptic countries and governments are in the 2004 accession states in Central and Eastern Europe, and even though the three most sceptical of them (Poland, Hungary, Czech Rep) are yet to adopt the Euro, they would have too much to lose financially in the event they left the EU."

For all the other countries 1 July 2017 is probably too soon. I don't think it is very likely that Marine Le Pen will be the next French president (the second round of the vote takes place in May). And even she may not want to act that fast."
