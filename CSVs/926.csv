The FCO advice is still advise against all but essential travel to China, with Wuhan being advise against all travel, further reducing the likelihood of an earlier resumption in service. Shorter more profitable flights have not resumed. It is likely that short haul flights would resume before flights to China."

Based on an IAG press release it seems they are not going to think about ramping up the schedule again before June and we in the UK may just be coming out of the most severe elements of the lockdown by the end of May. So if there is nothing major that changes, it feels like BA may try to trying to ramp up a schedule by early June, but I doubt they start with BA, and they probably play that out based on whether they get travel on less ""risky"" routes. Not seeing a big push for business or pleasure travel from what I see in media or talking to people. So it feels like it is something like Prob things do not get worse x Prob BA will even try running more flights in June on that basis x Prob they will get traction on more normal parts of the schedule in June . The first and second links may be a bit above 50%, but the last one seems to me likely to be a lot below"

I predict that British Airways will most likely continue their flights to China around June because the summer months are when most people take holidays and travel combined with the fact that the Chinese Dragon festival occurs in late June of 2020. The combined stress that travel companies will have due to loss of revenue from their flight suspensions and their decrease in expected revenue from the summer vacationing will likely cause British Airways to continue their flights in June. Also, according to an article posted by British Airways in 2018, the company has expanded their work force by having a third of their employees on flights to China be Chinese nationals to help with customer service. Along with this, British Airways operates around 17 flights to China per week which does seem to be a loss of revenue that this company cannot afford to have for too long due to flight revenue decreasing in general."
