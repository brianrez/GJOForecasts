The number of states has increased significantly since the beginning of this challenge and even though the number is less over the last couple of months it doesn't seem that the changes are occurring fast enough to be below 23 by mid January. This is especially true since going into the holiday season, the population as a whole seems determined to continue gathering in groups with many not wearing masks. I expect things to start changing after mid January when the New Years Eve fallout declines. I actually think the chance is probably better than 90% that there will be more than 23 states above Rt 1.0 but since I'm not sure how I would refine the estimate any better I will be conservative.

However, all but 2 states (Alabama and Arizona) have 1.0 within the margin of error for their estimations, meaning the number over 1.0 right now could potentially be as high as 48 out of 50 states. Moreover, many states have leveled out near the 1.0 mark (either above or below) in recent months as shelter in place orders have been lifted and reopening has begun. Both the federal government and many state governors have openly denounced the idea of shutting down the economy again, meaning that these numbers are unlikely to decrease very soon. In fact, it appears the only real precaution still in effect is the social norm of mask wearing, which is still not required by federal law or, indeed, openly encouraged by many state and federal politicians. Moreover, the WHO has just announced it hopes the pandemic to be over in... 2 years. This signals that we are unlikely to see a sudden drop to 0 any time soon without policy changes and more aggressive mitigation techniques. As such, I believe it will likely remain around current levels for the coming months, with potential random fluctuations up and down due to random error and unforeseen events (ex: school reopenings, large public gatherings, etc.) that could have detrimental effects on local communities."

Looking through the website FAQ, it's clear that what it is measures is the rate at which the number of cases is increasing. If a state has 1 person infected and that person infects 6, the state's Rt is 6, whereas a state that has 10000 cases and 1000 new cases has an Rt of .1. So we're not predicting cases but the rate of infections given the caseload. For example, NH has hovered around .9 to 1 for the past 4 months despite averaging like 60 new cases a day. NJ has been at exactly 1 despite being at 1/3 of their max cases."

Also, with increased infections, we presumbably have increased immunity, further decreasing Rt but I believe that that we would need a much higher Rt to induce herd immunity within 5 months."

Texas case is useful to see the numbers. The narrative is that TX cases are EXPLODING because the the state recklessly opened early. TX is averaging something like 70k tests daily, and can barely keep it at 1. So even when testing everybody who will hold still, even though hospitalization rates are dropping, the RT has trouble holding up. There would have to be a colossal second wave and mass reinfections in order to keep us in the positive range. see https://rt.live/us/TX."
