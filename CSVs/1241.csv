This was then followed by a test of a more extreme ICBM, the Hwasong-15, in November of 2017 [https://missilethreat.csis.org/country/dprk/]. Though at the time it appeared that North Korea was quickly developing an ICBM with the intent of one day launching it, reports of this appeared to die down. However, after a second summit between Trump and Kim in May of 2019 in an attempt to brokerage peace fell through, it was reported by the Seoul intelligence service that cargo vehicle movement was spotted at the site in which is known for ICBM development [http://time.com/5546740/north-korea-icbm-uranium-sanumdong-vehicle-activity/].

While the country has ceased to launch anymore missiles, expert warn that Mr. Kim has begun mass production of his weapons in the event that they are attacked. It is unlikely that North Korea will launch an ICBM before January 2020 because they have been unsuccessful in developing an missile that does not burn up on reentry, and they have shifted their focus from launches to mass production."

ICBM and nuclear tests are intended to frighten, intimidate, and capture attention. Doing so before January 2020 might destabilize US support for Trump, thus jeopardizing North Korea's ability to negotiate on a world stage. This could ultimately mean significant issues within North Korea, where they are struggling for food and medicine that could be easily provided by a brokered partnership with South Korea and the west. Further, China is likely to want to improve North Korea's ability to trade with other global partners as a potential longer term method of avoiding the impact of future trade wars, so they are likely to push North Korea to act calmly rather than launching tests."

While the missile tests have always been somewhat of a concern for the US, ROK has been living with DPRK as an immediate threat. While the ICBMs would generally be used to strike the US if Kim had such inclination, the more likely scenario is that ROK is the first place where missiles would strike. With the DPRK-ROK relationship thawing, some would argue in spite of US preference, there's little to be gained by repeatedly testing missiles."

It is very interesting to know that Russia is playing very import background role in this issue. Many adversaries of US want Trump to remain president to gain their own agenda move forward. When Trump leaves, with force or without, it will likely that North Korea will conduct test within few weeks after that, This is even highly likely if Trump does not completes its first term. That is a separate issue but still connected based on political calculations by Russia and its influence on North Korea. This poll is really about what happens in USA."
