I always thought that Odessa was a long shot for them, given the flat, muddy farmland, multiple river crossings, and the need to stick to major roads. So I think the whole ambition of Russia taking and absorbing Ukraine's southwest has pretty much evaporated. The action now will be in Luhansk/Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhia as the Russians try to pull out a victory by linking Crimea with Luhansk/Donetsk. I don't expect them to withdraw from the Odessa front, just to consolidate their holdings there as a bargaining chip. In my opinion, Putin will try to negotiate at the very least a cease-fire in place once Mariupol falls, and perhaps offer a pullback behind the lower Dnieper to sweeten the deal. This will freeze the conflict, if not end it, and for Putin 's failures in Kyiv and elsewhere he can use the old Pee-Wee Herman excuse when he suffers a particularly humiliating pratfall: ""I meant to do that."""

I think the South Ossetian referendum being planned proves Russia isn't afraid to go for it even though they're already bogged down. The main question is whether Russia manages to annex all of the Black Sea coast in the next four months, which seems unlikely. They probably have to win in Donbas and Kyiv before they are likely to bother, and that's hard. But four months is a long time and I'm convinced the mens rea is already there. I wouldn't totally put it past them recognizing independence prior to creating the necessary land bridge, but I would give that low single digit odds."

Alternatively, news from the Ukraine-Russian conflict indicates the Russians are potentially looking to moderate their claims in Ukraine as it has proved a more difficult undertaking than they had likely anticipated. On one hand, further recognition of independent statelets within other countries probably doesn't do much for a Russian state looking to capitulate on their demands in Ukraine and attempt a normalization. On the other hand, this is a means of potentially (appearing to) advance the initiative, again that costs Putin essentially nothing except potentially some of the goodwill of his Western interlocutors."

Shorter-time frames could be applied (since Putin is in power - roughly two decades; since the first recognitions - a bit more than 1 decade) .
