Additionally, uncertainty about the level of breakthrough infections among the vaccinated and limited information on how many Emiratis and residents remain to be vaccinated (despite the government procuring at least enough vaccine of different types for all persons) make the ability of continued vaccination to further reduce the case count unclear. Lastly, several headwinds exist in the next 6 weeks that may challenge the current pace of decline including the recent end to travel restrictions for residents from India and other countries, the hosting of the world exception in Dubai in October, and the public holiday of Mawlid celebrated in mid-October. However, I rate an increase in the 7-day average to 1,500 or higher as a relatively low 20% because despite these headwinds, the state possess the means to reverse negative trends through a return to more stringent lockdown and travel restriction measures."

You can't really plug in 1â€“1/R0 when immunity is less than full for those previously infected or fully vaccinated and different studies give you different numbers.
