Perhaps the ship as in port to confirm ISR reporting or perhaps to limit possible collateral damage. However, collateral damage could also be minimized by targeting another transport ship before it docks. If it's correct that supplies from Iran are on board, it's possible that Iranian forces could also be on board. While this is still a small probability, it is another way in which the criteria could be met. I also agree with posters that reference JCPOA negotiations and the motivation for Iran to minimize confrontations and any destruction of a vessel as described above would be done in a manner to avoid attribution to Israel."

Though not meeting the parameters of this question, it indicates the increasing possibility of Israel acting against Iranian forces in Iran or at sea to protect itself. I am keeping the projection at only 20% because of the likelihood that Israel would act in such a way as to have deniability making it difficult to assign blame on Israel."

102132,2021-08-14T15:47:42Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],There has just been an election of a more conservative president. This kind of incident appears to be very rare and would be a big step. Therefore I don‘t expect that the new Iranian President would sanction such an incident so early in their term (all things being equal - the ayotollah has not changed). I could envisage lethal encounters between proxies or civilian worker deaths (eg in an Iranian nuclear facility) but I think that the chances of actual reported action resulting in official security force deaths to be low.

93350,2021-08-14T11:52:29Z,1,[50.0],[50.0],"On land Iran’s prefers to use proxies to attack Israel by supplying them with missiles but retaining a plausible deniability if accused of aggression and avoiding the loss of its troops. Iran’s air force is now outdated (pre-1979) and the chances of it procuring new generation fighter jets are considered slim. The one area where its personnel are involved in direct action appears to be with the QUD revolutionary guard and attacks against commercial tankers using drones, limpet mines while utilising fast boats with commandos. Israel has been involved in tit-for-tat maritime skirmishes with both sides keeping their actions and reactions proportional to avoid an escalation. Given the past record Ebrahim Raisi, the new President of Iran, who Israel consider to be extremely dangerous, these attacks will continue. It is possible that the Royal Navy or US Navy might come into contact with the QUD force and cause a lethal action, but that is not the question. I will suggest that effective policing in the Gulf may prevent Iranian commandos from causing a problem that would preclude action by the GCC or Israel. The other issue is if the JCPOA talks concerning a deal to constrain Iran’s nuclear program fail, then Israel may feel committed to bombing their facilities that will cause fatalities."

If this was going to happen, it would likely be with Israel. But the difficult part is attribution.
