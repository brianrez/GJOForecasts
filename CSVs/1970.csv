The debate / forces of anti-american bases in Phillipines vs anti China in the S China Sea debate seems to have already played out in favor of the USA, at least at the judicial and legislative levels. Perhaps enough of the public disagree with those decisions to make their voice heard in the election by voting for Duterte, but I think anti-china nationalist sentiment and demonstrated respect for female political leadership in the Philippines limit that probability. http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/leading-philippine/2718364.html"

Wikipedia has the links: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_in_the_Philippine_presidential_election,_2016 I'm skeptical of the Magdalo poll from Mar. 2-4, which shows a big increase for Duterte and a big decrease for Roxas which isn't reflected in other polls before or since, and I'm inclined to toss it. The three-poll average (i.e. March) for the candidates excluding that poll is as follows: Poe: 27% Duterte: 23% Binay: 23% Roxas: 21% I also tend to think that Poe will get a bump (most likely at the expense of the ideologically-similar Roxas) in the next poll, and tend to favour Binay over Duterte because the former would seem to have better party machinery behind him."

The remain four candidates are closely grouped. If we take an average of the last four polls released on the election, we find Poe leading the way with 27%, Binay in second at 25%, Duterte in third at 23% and Roxas in fourth at 20%, with all of them within striking distance of each other. The key item now is Poe's eligibility to run, currently before the Supreme Court. I don't have any insight into how the court will rule, but I do note that six of the 15 judges were appointed by political ally (and current president) Benigno Aquino, while the other nine were appointed by Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, who defeated Poe's father in the 2004 presidential election. I'm guessing here that it's 60/40 they rule Poe ineligible, strictly on that split. If she is eligible I'd give here a 30% chance of winning (a slight plurality) so assuming my 60/40 split is somewhere in the ballpark of reasonable that leaves her 12%. Where do her votes go if she's deemed ineligible? My guess from an hour or so of reading is primarily to Roxas. Both are allies of Aquino; Poe ran as an independent but as part of his Team PNoy in the 2013 senatorial elections and Roxas aggressively courted her to be his running mate as VP in this election. That likely migration is enough to boost Roxas' totals for me. Binay arguably has the value of incumbency in that he's the current Vice President (though he narrowly beat Roxas, who was affiliated with Aquino and has been endorsed by him), and his polling numbers seem to have stabilized after a steep fall from mid-2014 to mid-2015. Two of the last six vice presidents have gone on to the presidency, though the numbers increase to 2-of-3 if we disregard those who chose not to run. Duterte can't entirely be ruled out, but he's been vocally opposed to Poe's eligibility and its hard to imagine her support swinging his way if she's deemed ineligible."

Polling suggests there are only a small number of undecideds. A fifth candidate is polling very poorly, so I am excluding them completely. There are four leading candidates, so baseline for each is 25%. The race is tight between the four, polling has seen substantial changes, the official campaign has only recently begun and the final list of candidates was only finalised at the end of January 2016. Roxas has seen his poll numbers steadily improve, but has not yet broken through the pack and has to still be considered fourth. However, this could change over the course of the campaign. Duterte, with the exception of one short lived peak in Dec 2015, has polled similarly to Roxas. It will be interesting to see if he can maintain momentum and gain traction across the country. Binay started out as the clear favourite in polling in 2014, but as the menu of candidates has become clearer his lead has fallen and then evaporated. However, his polling numbers have not dipped below 20%, suggesting a substantial core support base. Poe is the current leader in averaged polls and has seen support rise over time and has not been below 20% since before mid-2015.
