It did not need to use this option when the Legco was stormed and universities where under siege in 2019. With the new laws in place, this kind of popular uprising has become a lot less likely. So why provoke the general population, the United States, etc. by doing something so radical, if the HK police are perfectly capable of roughing up protesters, and the courts now provide a tool to lock up people indefinitely?"

According to reports the PLA and PAP already have a presence in Hong Kong in either a support or monitoring effort. Us military power, UK ex-colonial power, Australia regional strategic power and Canada are starting to increase their pressure on China by restricting visas, ceasing extradition treaties and offering resident/citizen visas to Hong Kong people. The U.S. is withdrawing special country status from China that diminishes its role as a global financial hub. Huawei telecommunications equipment is being deleted or restricted as a supplier to the Five eyes intelligence group. The credibility of the Chinese government has been eroded due its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam have been treated with disdain by China in a dispute over the South China sea islands showing the Chinese governments influence as a superpower. It is a matter of honour for China to reclaim Hong Kong as it was taken by a dominant colonial power and funded by drug money by supplying opium to their people to subjugate them. China now has the power to take control of its own destiny and a lessening need for HK. Hong Kong is still a financial hub, albeit diminishing due to rise of Shanghai and with Singapore in the background; China will need to dismantle the Hong Kong administration step by step. An overt invasion of Hong Kong by the PLA/PAP would be a massive PR disaster (Tiananmen Square) and is not necessary. China has the power; HK has no military force of its own and can be assimilated into China step by step and at China’s timing. The overwhelming force is already there, a PR disaster in the glare of the World’s media is not required. A possible weak link of China is the number of students it has studying in the West and their immediate dismissal and relocation to China might cause a problem. Australia 260,000; 369,000 US; 120,000 UK. (2019) Therefore, I propose a 10% chance of full mobilisation at his stage, although a surreptitious activity could be currently happening by the PAP."

Firstly, we should note that neither the PLA nor the PAP have ever been used in Hong Kong since the handover. Any change of this policy would cause domestic and international outrage in light of the 'one country, two systems' principle. Furthermore, China, conscious of its soft power, will be keen to avoid any Tiananmen-style images going around the world. However, engagement by either the PLA or PAP would not necessarily be as violent as the Tiananmen massacre. They could simply act as reinforcements for the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF). As Carrie Lam has said, the HKPF has been 'outnumbered' in recent protests. These comments, in addition to comments by the PRC that it would 'not sit idly by' have created a rhetoric that opens the door to a future mobilisation of the PLA or PAP in Hong Kong. Considering that China wants to be seen as a responsible actor, the only real motivation for such a mobilisation would be continued and out of control protests. The recent actions by the PRC and Hong Kong legislatures provide ample reason for such protests. China has doubled the size of its contingent in Hong Kong, which notably now includes the PAP, which has been used in similar situations in Tibet and Xinjiang (the major difference lying in the fact that Hong Kong is a SAR). Mobilisation of these forces would, under the current rule of law, have to be requested by the Hong Kong government; a possible scenario, considering Carrie Lam's allegiance to the PRC and her comments on the HKPF being outnumbered. Lastly, the role of Covid-19 should be understood. Amidst the ongoing crisis countries have turned inwards, providing an opportunity for Beijing to move forward on some of its key ambitions with a weaker international backlash. Evaluating all of these arguments, 35% at this time seems adequate."

China has been emphasizing its apparent/perceived successful control of the outbreak as a success story of its type of government. Apparent lots of its citizens, including those in HK, believe in it. This makes it more likely to use PLA in enforcing its wishes in HK. However, there is little large-scale protests going on in HK right now - they have been much affected by the Covid-19 outbreaks. It is not clear whether large-scale protests will happen in the near future - it also depends how the Covid-19 outbreak pans out in the summer. If there is no large-scale protest, there is no need for the PLA intervention."

81522,2020-02-09T21:52:40Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"It is highly unlikely that the PRC will utilize PLA and/or PAP troops in Hong Kong (10%). Thus far, Hong Kong's police force (or counter-protesters) has effectively contained the demonstrations. With only a handful of fatal casualties to date, there seems to be no need for China's more robust military forces to be mobilized in HK. Xi Jinping remembers well the results of armed forces being mobilized to quell demonstrations in Tiananmen Square and hopes to avoid that at all costs. Although the PAP has been successful with its operations in Xinjiang and Tibet its mobilization in a Special Administrative Region (SAR) such as HK would represent a more real and symbolic violation of its own ""One Country, Two Systems"" policy. China's economy is slowing and the PRC is currently scrambling to address its Coronavirus population. Damaging its reputation with HK, especially after it received support from the US President, might have disastrous blowback on its economy via trade. It still has to iron out trade deals with the US as well. There are many variables regarding the US general election this year, so any hasty moves that would cause President Trump to criticize China might manifest themselves for 4 more years (if he is re-elected in 2020)."

But, the corona virus has shifted the priories of China so they will not increase their troops in this moment. so this will delay the number, but that does not been that they will be mobilize before January 2021.
