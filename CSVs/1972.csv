On this one I don't foresee any more difficulty than I've grown accustomed to with GJ questions. I do, however, feel the structure of this question is not as good as it could be. The Yes categories should be structured as conditionals. It's quite enough, I think, to forecast upon the yes/no outcome in itself. In comparison, the varieties of ""yes,"" while not trivial amongst themselves, are trivial in comparison to the ""yes/no"" outcome. There would seem to be a qualitative difference between a forecast that is wrong on the yes/no step, as compared to a forecast that is wrong on the specific yes outcome."

The only country that can prevent Syria and the entire near Middle East from falling under Western (w/ Russian collaboration) control is China. China needs to make a move or it will be primarily reliant upon energy resources from only two Middle Eastern sources: Iran or a Western dominated coalition that includes Russia. It is in the interest of China to keep the remaining Middle Eastern countries as independent as possible, and while China could conceivably move directly into Syria in support of Assad, a more likely initial step would be to demonstrate, via joint exercises, that China is prepared to defend their access to ""non-dominated"" Middle Eastern energy resources."

It has keen interest in Iran’s geostrategic location, bordering both the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf. The location enables China carry out the One Belt One Road agenda. Iran stands as China’s most important ally in the Persian Gulf, and China may find it difficult to deepen cooperation with Gulf Cooperation Council countries, given their positive ties with the United States. Iran on the other hand, due to historic ties with China and longstanding suspicion of the United States, remains a trustworthy ally for China. As noted by analyst Jeffry S Payne, “the overland Silk Road cannot effectively connect the east to the west without Iran as an integrated part.” China conducted joint naval exercises with Iran in 2014, and this may be a way to keep a check on growing naval cooperation between India and Iran – two countries that conducted joint naval exercises in 2003, 2006 and 2015. Iran is also following in China’s footsteps to create an anti-US anti-access area denial strategy, or A2/AD, to reduce US military supremacy in the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean Sea. China undoubtedly expects Tehran to play an integral part in Beijing’s string of pearls – building a string of naval facilities in the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean to counter American influence. Middle East markets are essential for China’s One Belt One Road program of building a network of manufacturing and transportation centers in Central Asia and Europe. Beijing also looks beyond Iran – establishing nuclear cooperation with Saudi Arabia and in the process of building a relationship with other GCC countries. This could lead to reducing tensions between rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran by providing economic opportunities through the One Belt One Road initiative. This requires balance on the part of Beijing. In January, Xi traveled to the Middle East, visiting Riyadh as well as Tehran probably to assure both and discourage misinterpretations that China supports one country over the other.'"

I think there is a tiny chance of China holding exercises with one state - and I have put SA over Iran based on little more than ""gut feeling"" - US relations are improving with Iran vice the Sunni Arab states which would potentially make China work with SA."

The paper outlined the strategy of “active defense,” which is essentially an amalgamation of the concepts of offshore defense and open seas protection. The strategy maintains, “The traditional mentality that control of the land is more important than control of the sea must be abandoned, and great importance has to be attached to managing the seas and oceans and protecting maritime rights and interests.” The ideas articulated in this strategy have already begun to crystallize; China’s ships have progressively been operating away from their coasts over the years and they are going to continue to operate even further and for longer periods. However, in order to prove its mettle, China has to do more than just operate far from home; they must demonstrate significant operational capability. The Pentagon’s 2015 report on China’ s Military Power noted, “Whereas ‘near seas’ defense remains the PLA Navy’s primary focus, China’s gradual shift to the ‘far seas’ has necessitated that its Navy support operational tasks outside the first island chain with multi-mission, long-range, sustainable naval platforms with robust self-defense capabilities.” China has set out to do exactly that. Their naval fleet has provided an escort for over 6,000 commercial ships; their hospital ship Peace Ark has been frequently dispatched to provide healthcare to countries in need; and their warships are increasingly relied upon for real-world missions from counter-piracy to evacuations of Chinese citizens.""

Or it may be that China will think they needn't bother to stretch their forces any thinner, what with having plenty to do in the East and South China Seas. As for the first, now that piracy has slackened some in the Arabian Sea, there is less point to joint maneuvers there, and there is certainly no reason for either Iran or Saudi Arabia to paddle that far east. So my guess is that China's attitude just now is not to engage in needless exercises far afield from their current area of interest. The operative word is ""guess."""

China is also Irans largest trading partner and stands to potentially benefit the most as sanctions are lifted. Iran currently exports about 600,000 barrels/oil per day to china, while using some of the proceeds to purchase chinese goods. Now that Iran is free to ship oil to other nations China may want to maintain its position as the largest recipient of iranian oil, thus could be willing to share more of its military technology and know-how. China is also the worlds third largest importer and exporter of armaments. In the wake of the nuclear resolution with iran and the west, saudi arabia could look elsewhere to find weapons to secure its position in the region, perhaps turning to china which in turn could lead to closer military ties and maybe even joint military exercises."

They do seem worried over ISIl, and mor so about trade coming to them from that area. Interesting, they just held their first exercises with India, and have also held exercises with Malaysia and Thailand, so they not only seem interested in strengthening military ties internationally ( which they have hesitated to do historically) and also seem focused on protecting trade routes relevant to their economy. Now given their current domestic market situation they may have bigger fish to fry, but I still think the market is too low on this question."

Their dealings in Iranian oil may be the only strategic pull to their involvement (if tensions increased in the region for example) but I don't think there's anything to suggest this will be the case. There may be some risk that joint-operations will occur in response to American joint-ops with China's immediate neighbours, but I'll have to see if I can find any info on that in the meantime. China has a deep strategic relationship with Pakistan, including deep-water port facilities, that allow it to protect its sea lanes in the event of a problem. However, if a worsening domestic situation were to occur, perhaps in response to continued unrest in Hong Kong or economic turmoil (China's shadow-banking sector is a little scary), then the Chinese may adopt a more jingoistic approach as a propaganda tool. That said, having looked at the PLAs website, they have conducted a number of joint exercises with various navies of late, though most seem focused on the Pacific as opposed to the Indian ocean. On balance, for now at least, China has it's own concerns closer to home. The spread of my forecast reflects the relatively long time horizon and the fact that information from China is scarce. Also, amidst so much potential turmoil, things can escalate quickly."

China's trade with Europe will soon be directly through Iran (by sea and rail), and Iran's oil and gas are key to China's future energy security. Iran itself presents many new investment opportunities that China sorely needs to help compensate for its slowing economy. Xi's recent trip to Iran was evidence of such. But S.A. is still the dominant oil producer when it comes to supply and control over prices so China must balance relations and help to avoid a SA-Iran direct conflict. China doesn't want to create an even more tense situation and cause energy supplies from either Iran or S.A. to be disrupted or hampered enough to cause increased volatility in prices and supply. So that leaves me with two choices for China here: either don't have exercises with either, or have exercises with both-. Having exercises with both would serve the additional purpose of further integrating the PLAN into the strait of Hormuz/ Gulf shipping lanes security and further asserting China's role in the middle east as regional / global power who can serve as an alternative to the US. Establishing the new PLAN base in Djibouti was the first step in this process. So all in all I think China will have exercises with both or neither, and I'm leaning towards both, tempered by the dominance of ""No"" from other forecasters. http://www.inss.org.il/index.aspx?id=4538&articleid=11378 http://globalriskinsights.com/2015/07/securing-the-sealanes-of-the-super-highway/ http://www.thegulfintelligence.com/Docs.Viewer/2aeeb02d-e2d8-483a-9f43-98dddf8dc89d/default.aspx http://www.thegulfintelligence.com/Docs.Viewer/2aeeb02d-e2d8-483a-9f43-98dddf8dc89d/default.aspx"
