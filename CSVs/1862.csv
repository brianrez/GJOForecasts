But who wants this election as part of Minsk agreements to happen at all? Donetsk and Luhansk authorities do not want it as it will permit the “fascist” Ukraine government to come to their turf and after the election they will need to cede control of the border to Ukraine and perhaps share their power with some elected officials. Why bother as they have all the power already? Ukraine’s government does not want it as the Minsk agreement forces them to have unpopular measures for decentralization and constitutional reform to pass through Rada. It uses this situation as an excuse for struggling economy. Russia does not want it as militarized Donbass is playing a role of a stumbling block for Ukraine to move closer to the West, join EU and NATO. Only the West wants the election in belief that a democratic process settles all scores and leads to peace and prosperity. Can we conclude that probability of elections is zero? Not quite. The West does hold some cards: Ukraine depends on their support. And they say that Obama wants to settle Ukraine situation before he leaves the office. On the other hand, Putin may be open to a bargain – non-aligned Ukraine, end of sanctions, some acknowledgement of Russia as a great power… Donbass requires a stream of money and arms at the time of economic crisis. As Donbass almost completely depends on Russia, they will do whatever Russia says: all disagreeable leaders were eliminated one by one. My problem with this scenario is that it is not the first priority either for Americans, or for Europeans. Of course, Donetsk and Luhansk can have elections to legitimize their power and stick it to the Man (in Kiev). But probability of that is low too – no real opposition in their respective turfs. So unless there is some movement to a great bargain between Russia and the West, I put probability of elections at zero. I may regret that."

Russia would want to keep their troops in Donetsk as a form of intimidation and would not want an election otherwise. The Ukraine would not want an election while Russian troops are present and they would want the Russian propaganda machine to tone down. Donetsk is on the border and has a high percentage of Russian ethnic population and an even higher percentage of Russian speakers. Russia will not give in on this and with EU members considering easing up on sanctions why would they.
