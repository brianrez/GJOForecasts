The IMF has since released a January 2021 World Economic Outlook Update to account for policy support and vaccines to increase economic activity (IMF, 2021). Due to the support of the international community in combating COVID-19, economic relief and activity has increased and the market has adapted to redirect the course of economic growth over 2021. With the ability to obtain the COVID-19 vaccines becoming widely available soon, the impact to the economy has softened and thus allowed for a stronger recovery in the market (IMF, 2021). Policy implementations such as providing for households, providing resources for healthcare facilities, and economic policies to limit persistent damage have all aggressively combatted the damage of COVID-19 (IMF, 2021). The 15% No estimate in my assessment pertains to the impact of differing strains of the COVID-19 virus. While the vaccines have proved to be effective in most sectors, if a new strain of the virus is not combatted effectively by the virus, more research, containment strategies, and economic recovery programs could stall the hopeful outlook outlined in the January 2021 World Economic Outlook Update (IMF, 2021)."

The estimate for 2020 is 0.9 percentage point higher than projected in the October WEO forecast. This reflects the stronger than-expected recovery on average across regions in the second half of the year. The 2021 growth forecast is revised up 0.3 percentage point, reflecting additional policy support in a few large economies and expectations of a vaccine-powered strengthening of activity later in the year, which outweigh the drag on near-term momentum due to rising infections” (IMF 2021, p. 5)."

Unemployment is particularly helpful in determining the outlook of global futures. The US labor market recovered faster than expected with a unemployment rate of 6.9% reported in OCT2020. However, the true state of employment will emerge once the heavy government aid subsides (Curr, 2020). The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) projected that all G-20 countries, other than China, would experience a recession in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. The global GDP will not return to pre-pandemic levels until Q3 2021. While the OECD projections differed from November 2019 to September 2020 given the sharp dip caused by the pandemic lockdowns, the rate of growth remain largely the same (World Economic Fund, n.d.). However, the global GDP is not expected to extend above pre-pandemic levels until 2022. The continuance of the pandemic and associated economic impacts have suppressed economic predictions going into 2021 (Ritcher, 2021). In June, 2020, the IMF reported a 1.9 percent decrease in economic growth as compared to its April, 2020 predictions. For 2021, the IMF forecasted a 5.4 percent growth in GDP, which is 6.5 percent lower than the predictions made in January 2020 prior to the pandemic (IMF, 2020). In October, 2020, the IMF projected a 5.2 percent growth in world GDP for 2021."

In comparison to the previous estimate, the 2021 prediction has been raised by 0.3 percentage point.

In addition, just last week China set an increased goal for their GDP growth in 2021 (China rebounds with economic growth target above 6%, 2021). Therefore, leaving the (extremely low) possibility of an impactful, unforeseen world event, there is almost a 100% chance that the IMF estimate for world GDP growth for 2021 will be higher in its April 2021 World Economic Outlook report relative to its October 2020 report, as it already personally reported that the outlook has been revised to a higher projection."

The report states that the growth is a recovery from 2020’s severe collapse, revised by 0.3% from the previous projection of 5.152%. This 0.3% increase reflects “expectations of a vaccine-powered strengthening of activity”. The recovery will vary across countries and regions, dependent on access to medical interventions, effective policy support, and infection spillovers from other countries. Despite the toll of the pandemic on the economy and people, economic activity is adapting. There are, however, risks to this outlook. If progress is slower-than-anticipated and there is a struggle to contain the virus and vaccinate people, this could weaken confidence and lead to withdrawn policy support. Growth is going to depend on vaccine rollout and the incidence of COVID-19 infections. Though, it is expected that therapies will gradually become more widely accessible during 2021-2022. By the end of 2022, local transmission of the virus will be brought down to lower levels everywhere."

It does note that its prediction is clouded in uncertainty, complicated by hopes from vaccine approvals and concerns from new virus variants, but that its increase of 0.3. percentage points reflects “expectations of a vaccine-powered strengthening of activity later in the year and additional policy support in a few large economies.” I believe that the predictions that IMF will make in its April 2021 WEO report will depend on the success of vaccine rollouts, country policies aimed at economic recovery, and multilateral cooperation to aid low-income developing countries in recovery over the next month. These things are hard to forecast, but with new vaccines being administered and distributed each day, countries aimed at reigniting their economies, and rising international cooperation to distribute vaccines to low-income countries, I expect the IMF estimate for world GDP growth for 2021 be higher in its April 2021 World Economic Outlook report relative to its October 2020 report. Additionally, the WHO There are factors that could cause the estimate to decrease, such as international conflicts, rapid spread of COVID variants, or evidence of vaccine failure, which is why I am leaving a 2% possibility of a decrease, but I do not foresee any major changes occurring within the next month before the April 2021 report is released."

A few pandemic related concerns raised in the update include further spread of coronavirus and logistical challenges to vaccine distribution. According to the John Hopkins global tracker, global daily cases have slightly decreased since the new estimate, returning to levels like those seen in October 2020. Also, Google’s calculation of available data shows that ten times as many people are fully vaccinated as there were on 26 January 2021 and almost three times as many people have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Furthermore, the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine should provide additional optimism for the April estimate. One other risk previously identified was the impact of a “no-deal Brexit”, which the latest report dismisses due to the December agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Based on these factors, I predict with almost certainty that the IMF will maintain an estimate higher than 5.152% for global GDP growth in the April report. I have assigned a 97% chance for this to occur, with only a 3% chance based on the possibility of issues in the efficacy of some vaccines or the rapidly increased spread of the virus due to early lifting of pandemic restrictions."

The Morgan Stanley report that we are now entering the self-sustaining phase of the V-shaped recovery initially projected in 2020. This assessment directly conflicts with the initial worries this past fall that the pandemic will have a bigger impact on private-sector risk appetite and, hence, global growth; however, experts say that consumers have driven the recovery. To continue progress in economic recovery, the reports state that 3 key factors will characterize the next stage: synchronized global growth, an emerging-market rebound, and the return of inflation. So I will be looking for these indicators in news/reporting to determine whether my confidence will increase or decrease in the coming weeks."

There are many advanced economic nations that have had positive monetary policy responses. I also think there will be a stronger global, internationalized response to combatting the virus in 2021 than there was in 2020. However, I am tempering my positivity because it is unknown just how much lasting damage the pandemic has inflicted on the global economy, from shutting down businesses, unemployment, government intervention to bail out. It is also unknown how rapid the virus recovery can take place in emerging and developing economies compared to advanced economies."

Having just had a recession, a new one's unlikely in the next three months (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0232615 implies <1% chance), so I'll base probability estimates on other forecasts released since October 2020. The IMF's October 2020 forecast of 5.152% is slightly lower than the average of more recent forecasts, with the OECD's December forecast being 4.2% (https://www.oecd.org/economic-outlook/), Fitch's 5.3% (https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/world-gdp-recovery-to-strengthen-from-mid-2021-on-vaccine-rollout-07-12-2020), Morgan Stanley's 6.4% (https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/global-economic-outlook-2021), Citi's 5.0% (https://www.citi.co.in/portal/pdf/annual-outlook.pdf), and Consensus Economics' November forecast 5.9% (calculated from a PWC average, https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/research-insights/economy/global-economy-watch/projections.html). Those forecasts are consistent with their prior versions (2.8 - 5.2% by the OECD in June, http://www.oecd.org/economic-outlook/june-2020/, 5.2% by Fitch in September, same link as prev.), so neither vaccines' better-than-expected performance nor worse-than-expected late-Autumn case numbers seem to have dominated other effects on growth forecasts, but indicators like the OECD's CLI provide indications that might make those more recent forecasts closer to the IMF April forecast (https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/180842)."

This opens the door for all jurisdictions to ensure that their testing thresholds are flow the levels that can create false positives. This information has been known for a long time. The New York times reported on it in the summer. Dr Fachi acknowledged it several months ago. Previously I believe it was believed by the authorities that having false positives was beneficial because it was better to err on the side of caution and it helped to justify stronger lockdowns. Now that the vaccine is being distributed changing the test threshold amounts will help it look like the vaccine is working, restoring public confidence. Florida has recently required its testing centers to report what their cycle thresholds are I believe that this will be a trend among all jurisdictions, which will lead to many fewer positive test results."

More bad news is expected as gov measures are playing a huge role in western world in avoiding mass bankruptcies and unemployment.
