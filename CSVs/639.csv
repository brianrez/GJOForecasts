If 11 do not show up and all Republkcans show then guess who wins? Also if Pelosi supporters stay away then a Democrat may be speaker but it won't be Pelosi. Pelosi always has opposition from within her party, would the opposition seize the moment to unseat her eve if means pjnishing party members who were sick or afraid to attend in person. https://thehill.com/homenews/house/530945-covid-19-could-complicate-pelosis-path-to-speaker-next-year How does this impact my 100% pelosi forecast?
