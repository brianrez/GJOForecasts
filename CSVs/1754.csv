Some have quoted: http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-trade-britain-idUKKBN17T1HN A rational person might well take the view that a free trade deal will be agreed, after all its in the interest of both the EU and UK. However most economists would also say that it would have been in the interests of the UK to not have voted for Brexit, but the UK did vote for Brexit.

The longer it is before the UK arrives at a trade deal with the EU, the greater the risk of the UK hitting a downward Investment Spiral There is a considerable lag between good or bad news and its affect on business investment (probable about 18 months). If the bad news was the Brexit vote in June 2016, the effects on investment will arrive around the end of 2017, but the effects of the economy as a whole will only be starting in 2018. The lack of investment will be damaging to productivity, which will hit profits unless the pound falls. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/brexit-business-investment-weak-2017-bank-of-england-credit-conditions-a7681686.html Even if a UK EU free trade deal is agreed it will probable not be before 2019, by then there will have been at least a year of low business investment and a successful free trade agreement in might not result in business investment actually taking place until 2020 and feeding through to the economy until 2021. That's quite a wait."

The big factor that might affect the pound is the Brexit negotiations, but the market thinks it knows what is likely to happen with this between now and the end of June - the EU will presumably formally agree to the plan that Tusk has already outlined, talks on the status of citizens may have started by July but he does not expect anything to have been agreed and talks about things that would affect the value of the pound will not have started. It is more likely that something will happen that will affect the value of the dollar. It is considered likely that US interest rate may rise, which would tend to make the dollar more attractive, but the markets have probably already built that in to the dollar's current price (in fact the dollar might rise in anticipation and fall a little on it actually happening)."
