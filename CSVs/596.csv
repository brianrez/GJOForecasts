Looking at the current WHO data, there are 38,861,668 cases in the Americas. The average of the weekly increase of each country in the Americas is 6.6% for the past week. Without data on how much a vaccine would potentially reduce cases of COVID, I applied a 6.6% increase weekly for the next 3 weeks and got around 47 million cases in the Americas. By comparing this against the weekly charts on the website, it looks like the Americas have experienced about a 2-2.5 million case increase weekly, over the next three weeks that would mean 6-8 million additional cases."

Therefore assuming around a 75% increase in cases reported from week 1 to week 5 of 2021. The vaccine is only rolling out in Central and South America (47% of the population) in a very few countries and therefore I'm assuming a much higher increase of 90% in cases reported from week 1 to week 5 of 2021. I've not seen any changes in reporting techniques in the Americas for the WHO website. Taking into account the week 1 total for the Americas of 2,522,297 cases and multiplying by the aforementioned percentages weighted for population, I'm estimating a total of 43M cases on 01-Feb.

Outside view: According to the WHO dashboard, right now there are 40.76 million cases in the Americas. New cases reported in the last 24 hours is 441,576. The US has the preponderance, WHO reported 277195 yesterday. The CDC 7 day rolling average is 248K new cases in the US (country w/ largest impact on americas), with the trend continuing to spike. At 23 days times 441K cases, that’s an extra 10 million cases on Feb 1 after the Jan 31 cases are accounted for. That brings the total to 50.76 million. Even if the US amounts are not at a rate of 277K per day (CDC count is higher at 314K) and are instead at the 7 day rolling average, that only eliminates ~690K cases. Inside view: The vaccine rollout has been slow, effects are still happening from holiday travel, and the B1.1.7 mutation is just starting to get going in the USA. It is the beginning of winter and people are going to be indoors. No major changes in preventive measures. (Although there could possibly be after the inauguration, but best case that wouldn’t have an effect until past 1 Feb). The trend line gives me no reason to believe that the 7 day average will even level off, let alone subside. No major breakthroughs on the horizon. Based on these factors, my estimate is 97% confidence that the Americas total is above 48 million, 3% confidence that it’s between 46-48 mil."

With quarantine fatigue and the unlikely potential for shutdowns effecting the numbers for several weeks even if implemented today, I do not see this being anything less than the current weekly average of 306,443.571 cases per day. At this average, we would be in the 44,000,000-46,000,000 bin by 1 Feb (306,443.571*24=7,354,645.704+37,538,493=44,893,138.704). However, today’s numbers are probably more telling, as we have reached 348,951 cases and the reporting period is still not over. I can easily see the numbers in the U.S. getting up to around 270,000-300,000 cases a day on its own. The U.S. had 260,937 cases reported yesterday according to a source other than the WHO, who is a little bit slower at increasing numbers. However, the U.S. is at 227,369 today according to the WHO. The other site I used has a similar number for two days ago, at 234,711. I expect tomorrow’s WHO numbers for the U.S. will likely be somewhere between 240,000 and 260,000, and the total for the Americas will also likely go up significantly. There are always dips in the numbers over the weekends, so I expect that the average will stay somewhere in Bin 4 for now, but we will see as the next few days show us what is happening after the holiday family gatherings."
