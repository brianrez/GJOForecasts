There seems almost no chance that any of the current area trade deals involving the USA or the EU will be ratified anytime soon because in the public mind negotiated trade deals equate to giving jobs to foreigners and/or setting up arbitration systems that give away sovereignty. So the average voter is convinced that a trade deal is a ""bad thing"". (What the average voter wants is a gun boat sent to the foreign country to force them to give us a sweet deal, as we did things in the 19th Century). However the question is will negotiations be completed. Negotiations could be completed with an agreement that is likely to be ratified, Negotiations could be completed with an agreement that is unlikely to be ratified. Negotiations could be completed with no agreement at all. With several big elections coming up in the next 15 months or so (US, French, German etc.) it is unknown which politicians would be in office when any TTIP agreement came up for ratification. Therefore completing negotiations in 2016 seems pointless because that would mean attempting to ratify an agreement that had been made under a different administration (certainly in the US and almost certainly in France). So it seems to me that it would be more productive to get as far with a TTIP agreement as possible this year, but leave the really difficult area for the next administration to struggle with. TTIP will be difficult sell, a TTIP agreement made by a previous administration, that started discussions when free trade sounded a ""good thing"", will be impossible to sell now that its viewed as a ""bad thing"". Who knows, in a couple of years time after Trumponomics and the freedom of Brexit have been shown to have some flaws, maybe an unfinished TTIP can be revived."

As citizens become increasingly unhappy with the status quo, I believe we have to start challenging the assumptions of globalization, and in particular, trade. Although many economists have agreed that increased trade leads to increased incomes, this has held true only for those at the top of the income ladder. As such, the discontentment with globalization could lead to postponed actions on closing trade deals in the short term, at least for now. Without the introduction of palatable unemployment benefits and wage insurance, I do not expect to see the conclusion of the negotiations of TTIP."

The details are currently secret When agreement is reached presumably they will become public, at that point every special interest group in North America and Europe will be searching for and complaining about every disadvantage real or imagined. Those who claim to be negatively effected will make a lot more noise than those who it is believed should benefit. To move from agreement to ratification will require leaders who can sell the benefits to their constituents. These leaders will need to be popular and trusted and have the political capital and will to push this controversial agreement forward. I don't see any such leaders in America or Europe who are free-trade advocates. I see plenty of leaders and potential leaders who are more interested in blaming all the ills of the world on foreigners in general and free-trade in particular. The leaders who would be most sympathetic to TTIP are struggling with other ""liberal"" policies that are upsetting voters and do not want another fight. Europe has Brexit, the Euro, austerity, high unemployment, immigration, the Middle East and Russia to worry about. The benefits of TTIP are not obvious to the average voter. Obama is getting to the end of his presidency and has plenty of unfinished issues to work on before he goes, without wanted to add another. All the front runners for being the next president appear to want more protection not more free trade."

Both sides agreed to accelerate their work between negotiating rounds to make significant progress. 2013 had 3 rounds of talks, 2014 and 2015 had 4 rounds each, considering they have reached the mid-game, that means around 50% of the discussion were complete in 11 talks. On average, each talk represents 4.5% of progress. If 2016 is also expected to have at least 4 rounds, that means 68% of TTIP expected to complete by year end. Aligning with consensus forecast makes my base at 47%. Negotiation areas mainly consist of tariffs, services and public procurement Topics still in discussion: agricultural goods (wines restrictions), public procurement at all levels of government, services and investment, telecom, rules of origin, regulatory cooperation, and specific sectors (medical devices, textiles, cars, ICT, engineering, chemicals, pesticides) O'Sullivan was bullish on the possibility of reaching the middle-game in February, meaning that all issues are up for discussion and negotiation and there is an idea of what the final deal will look like. However, both parties had also expected to conclude talks by end of 2015 last year but failed. Both parties have committed to speed things up, but the last round of talk only concluded 97% of tariffs, while other areas are still wide open."

One such area is the concept of a ""Regulatory Cooperating Body."" Another, no less contentious but far more prominent at the moment, is that of ""investment protection."" It seems there are basically three positions here: 1) The American position: Enhance the existing Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) framework which would provide maximum supra-sovereignty to foreign corporations via specialized commercial arbitration panels. 2) The EU position: Replace the ISDS framework with a new Investment Court System (ICS). This position is identical to the American position in terms of providing maximum supra-sovereignty to foreign corporations, except it accomplishes this with a body of professional judges and provides states the right of appeal. The path from the EU position to desired eventual world investment court via the UN is more straightforward. 3) The Juncker position. This would drop the idea of privileged investment protection for foreign corporations from the TTIP altogether, and place foreign corporations on the same standing as domestic corporations. This position broke an earlier block which allowed the TTIP to move forward, but was quickly abandoned once the negotiation process gained full steam."

From the other side they will see a fiercely fought presidential election with a Republican being asked about this trade deal and he will likely say ""Hell no"" or ""let me think about it. It will be much safer for them to conclude before the next president is sworn in. The only way out is if a Democrat wins, but they will not know that until November.

However, ratification as such isn't necessary to resolve this Q. If the Obama folks and the EU reps can work through the remaining issues, this will be a Yes.

The idea is to make bilateral agreements with countries which are more aligned with their resources and needs as was the result with the Pacific Agreement that was agreed upon with the East and West. The post-war economic matrix is no longer valid in that the US believes it is in their interest and those of their partners to distribute the labor and production into a more reasonable and collective strategy. Particularly for the US which is the main economic strength in the world and for areas in the EU that need a lifeline to import and export material beyond the German sphere of trade. As I stated in the previous forecast, the agreement may become less unified between the US and the EU and available for nations who opt in and trade with the US in fairer agreements, but the outcome of this change was built on the TTIP, maybe it will become known under another name and rules, it is a rose by any other name and will change the way the business agreements are designed between TTIP nations"

An obvious path of least resistance for TTIP negotiations is to mirror terms already agreed to in TPP. There are provisions in the TPP that McConnell's (R-Tobacco) and Hatch's (R-Pharma) sponsors don't like. They signal that y'all can negotiate all you like, we can't stop you, but we'll stop ratification. (McConnell can do that all by himself so long as he holds the position of Majority Leader.) Arrayed against that is a goodly portion of the rest of American industry, notably Ag and Auto, who are actually at the negotiating table, are reasonably happy with TPP and therefore, presumably, hopeful to see similar terms in TTIP. McConnell and Hatch have effectively signaled that they are putting down markers so that tobacco and pharma have a few more chips to play at the table and see if they can sweeten the deal."

(As an example of the kinds of trouble they could cause if they wanted to, look at congressional actions around the time of the Paris climate talks.) Much of the European's public objection is over agricultural terms. American agriculture recently got a renewal of the methanol standard, which really makes little economic or climate sense, at the expense of American oil. I suspect this will play out with the banksters getting much of what they want, American Ag losing some of what they want in favor of Europe, and American Oil getting back the ability to export. (But they will all have to be vewy vewy qwiet about it. It'll take several months.) Let's see how the oil export bill plays out as a first step."

The question whether this will happen before 1 January 2017 is difficult, but I would say that since the negotiations were almost finished, making some adjustments to address current concerns of people should be feasible with more than year to go. There is of course a chance that the renegotiation will take much longer, and there is a minor chance that the agreement will be cancelled completely, but given the benefits and how far the TTIP negotiations already have come I believe it more likely than not that it will be completed before 1 January 2015."

A Commission status report, obtained by POLITICO, shows that on 10 of the 24 chapters of the so-called Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) agreement, the two sides haven’t yet exchanged their positions, much less started to negotiate. ... Two EU sources involved in the negotiations said Washington’s focus on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), currently being negotiated between the U.S. and several Asian countries (including Japan, South-Korea, Vietnam and Singapore), is causing the delay."""

As regards France, its influence in EU decision making has been declining in recent years and the remarks of the French State Secretary for Foreign Trade are to be weighed in the context of the next French regional elections in December 2015. The French government and socialist party are really down in the polls and have to redeem themselves in the eye of the French public opinion. They try to show and get support from farmers as the latter feel threatened by an agreement such as TTIP. It is a part of a strategy to diminish the increasing influence of National Front in French politics. Moreover, on one side, the EU could need the agreement to be completed before the end of 2016, should the ""Brexit"" take a more credible turn in the wake of the 2017 British referendum. Reaching an agreement on the TTIP would indeed prevent the UK to leave the EU and would probably be one of the best arguments against euro-skeptics in the UK. It would consequently help prevent a EU explosion. One should also remember that the EU constitution was adopted against the public opinion vote in referendums in some major European countries (France, Netherlands). On the other side, President Barack Obama has been under repeated criticism from Republicans or even from Democrats for his erratic or unclear economic policy/program. It might be for him of importance to leave a trace of relevance in this area and a legacy which would include the creation of the world largest economic market. All those elements if they come in conjunction could trigger the probabilities the whole way around in very short a time."

699,2015-09-13T11:17:24Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"Europe gets tiered of the US's hegemony. EU slowly understands that in US, in the political system the corporations have too much to say. Though the highly consolidated main stream media is pushing for the agreement, alternative news outlets reject the deal, especially the provision which would allow corporations to challenge each countries legislation by court. Adding to this discomfort is the perception, that the refugee crisis was triggered by US, which devastated the middle east, but refusing to contribute to ease it, neither by taking a significant part of the refugees, nor by financial means. On the other hand, without the mentioned provision this deal is for the financial US oligarchy not of interest."

And, in my opinion, it will hard to reach universal agreement among parties involved in a year or so."

The timeline mentioned below assumes that we are in full agreement by year-end 2015, which seems quite aggressive to me. Then ALL of the EU states will likely need to ratify individually, and of course the U.S. will need to do so as well. I gather that Obama got fast-track authority, but even an up or down vote during an election year may be a tough thing to accomplish."

Trump is likely to continue to campaign for another half year or even more. He has come out against TPP i.e. Trans Pacific Partnership, so it is a given that he also will attack TTIP. Given that TTIP is not doing terribly well already, turning it into a high profile source of political conflict would just make things worse."

These trends all seem to be in the wrong direction. A major revision to the agreement may be needed, but the politics do not seem right for an agreement. 2016 is an election year in the US. Democrats, and parts of the Republican party are generally against this deal, and both parties are playing to populist themes this election cycle. Negotiations generally are not completed without fast track authority, and It seems very unlikely a lame duck president and congress would pass the agreement between the November 2016 election and Jan 20, 2017 inauguration, given the current environment."
