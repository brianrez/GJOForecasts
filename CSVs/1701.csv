Using a model based on initial claims data, I expect unemployment to remain in the 4.3-to-4.5% range in the near term. Consensus is a tad lower at 4.2%-4.4% (Econoday). Putting higher confidence on prediction given that the report is now only about 4 weeks away. Hopefully no major surprises from BLS tomorrow. :)"
