A small example, beginning the year the government received a donation of 36,000 rapid tests to diagnose COVID-19, $115 million for the productive sector (free availability). In the past it has supported government flagship projects such as the Vivienda Digna Project. It is also an important business partner, Nicaragua is the main supplier of shrimp to Taiwan. In addition, Taiwan refrains from commenting on domestic policy or democratic governance issues. There are precedents for Taiwan's support (outside the budget) to those countries that recognize it. So Taiwan's support for the government during this election year becomes relevant. In contrast, China's attempt to support the mega-project of the inter-oceanic canal has failed."
