According to the Economist (https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/12/21/why-lebanon-struggles-to-form-governments), it took two and a half years for Lebanon to elect its previous president, “nine years to hold parliamentary elections, and 12 years to pass a budget…Lebanon has spent nearly two and a half of the past 13 years without a government.” Political talks in Lebanon have a long history of dragging on for months with little resolution."

All signs point to nothing quick and possibly something messy in the interim: “Lebanon repaid a $1.5bn Eurobond that matures today. For most countries that would be no big deal. But Lebanon borrows more than most. Its debt burden is expected to reach 155% of GDP by the end of the year. Its bonds are already rated as junk. Investors are increasingly worried that the government, which spends more than it brings in, will default. A dollar shortage adds to the sense of crisis. Economists say a plan is needed to restructure the debt and introduce structural reforms. Alas, Lebanon lacks the leadership needed to do that. Big anti-government protests forced the prime minister, Saad Hariri, to resign last month. (He has remained in a caretaker role, but ruled out a return.) The demonstrators now hope to bring down the sectarian political system, which breeds corruption. Lately they have clashed with supporters of groups, such as Hizbullah, that benefit from the status quo. Both politically and financially Lebanon is a mess.”"
