Congressional Republicans have called for repeal of the JCPOA and one presidential candidate has promised to reinstate sanctions (Washington Post). Reimposition of sanctions lifted as part of the JCPOA will count, as would new sanctions punishing Iran for activity related to a nuclear program, including violations of the JCPOA or the NPT more broadly. Sanctions imposed for unrelated issues (e.g. The Guardian) will NOT count.

10746,2017-09-30T16:05:11Z,1,[3.0],[3.0],"Trump is looking for a reason to scrap the Iran Nuclear deal but is having a tough time finding a valid reason and thus far has only been able to say they are violating ‘the spirit of the deal’. The Trump administration extended sanctions relief on Thursday, Sept. 14 but the waiver must be renewed every 120 days which next falls on October 15. Trump is threatening action and to scrap the deal; even if without due cause there is a possibility that he will not re-certify. However, if he does not re-certify the deal then Congress has 60 days to re-impose suspended sanctions. A battle in Congress would likely ensue and any possible reinstated sanctions would likely not take effect before Nov. 1. Also, Europe is prepared to block sanctions re-imposed by the U.S., and they have a statute allowing them to do so. While the U.S. may attempt to re-impose sanctions, it is doubtful that this will be accomplished."

Iran's Guardian Council made sure during the vetting process that the vote would be free of surprises, sidelining the entire populist faction by disqualifying former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and weeding out candidates who would challenge the establishment's authority. As a result, much of Iran's foreign and security policy will remain in place no matter who wins the upcoming vote.

Ebrahim Raisi, whom many thought would succeed the supreme leader is looking like a strong candidate. “Analysts describe Raisi as utterly loyal to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, meaning he would likely remain deeply suspicious of engagement with the West but unlikely to backtrack on the nuclear deal which had the boss’s tacit consent” (http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2017/apr/15/what-would-hardliner-ebrahim-raisi-mean-for-iran-and-the-world-1593886--1.html) Ali Ansari, a professor of Iranian History at the University of St. Andrews said “Rouhani is not in as strong a position as we think he is, because he delivered the JCPOA. The JCPOA in Iran is not seen as a giant triumph, and for me the problem is the way Rouhani sold it” (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/16/iran-hassan-rouhani-face-tough-re-election-race-as-candidate-list-closes) Why Iran is unhappy with Rouhani: https://thewire.in/125190/iran-deep-state-unhappy-president-hassan-rouhani/"

The immediate trigger for the sanctions, which drew from a list of targets drawn up last year by the Obama administration, was Iran’s missile test last Sunday. In announcing the new sanctions, the White House made clear that it planned to call out every violation, and respond. Even inside the White House it is unclear how much further, beyond sanctions, President Trump is willing to take the confrontation. While he suggested during his campaign that he might scrap the nuclear deal, which he described as a “disaster,” Jim Mattis, and Rex W. Tillerson, made clear during their confirmation hearings that the world was better off with the accord, for the next decade at least, because of its prohibitions on Iran amassing enough enriched uranium or separated plutonium to manufacture even a single nuclear weapon. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/us/politics/iran-sanctions-trump.html ________________________ COMMENTS: For Washington and Tehran, the test itself was clearly less important than the symbolism of the moment. Mr. Trump wanted to demonstrate he would not tolerate even minor infractions of Iran’s commitments. While I do hope that cooler heads would prevail; we are not yet sure to whom Mr. Trump listens; we also do not know yet how much power Mr. Bannon has."

854,2016-12-22T18:29:52Z,1,[18.0],[18.0],"As I see it, there are two ways for this question to resolve to a Yes answer. First, Iran could actually carry out nuclear-related activity that leads to sanctions being imposed. Second, a foreign power could fabricate evidence that makes it appear that Iran has carried out nuclear-related activity. I think the odds of Iran carrying out nuclear-related activity during Rouhani's term are very small (1%), and I think the odds that Rouhani will be re-elected in May 2017 are very good (75%) based on his popular approval, working relationship with Khamenei, and Iran's growing GDP. I think the odds that a principalist will be elected are about 20%, and the odds that such a person would undertake nuclear-related activity in violation of the JCPOA before November 2017 are about 20%. So I calculate the odds for the first route to the outcome as roughly 5%. The second route is trickier. Trump does not seem to care for US intelligence analysis, which suggests that his team will want direct access to unprocessed intelligence. That intelligence could be loaded with false leads from states inimical to Iran, or from Iranian groups in exile that want to overthrow the current regime. I think amateur sleuths tend to weigh evidence on the basis of its emotional impact, so it may not be difficult to convince the Trump administration that Iran is undertaking a secret nuclear program (similar to the way Bush was led to believe Iraq had a WMD program). I put the odds at 80% that Trump will believe Iran is ""up to something nuclear"", and another 70% that Congress will go along with him. In order for sanctions to be effective, Trump would need to convince at least a few other members of the P5+1. China won't go along with it for economic reasons, and I don't think Germany will either as things stand now. Russia won't go along with it because of the post-Arab-Spring political bloc I think they are building in the Middle East, but they would be happy to see us shoot ourselves in the foot economically and strategically, so they won't stop us. That leaves France, where Le Pen might win, and the UK, where Iran is still not very popular. I think the odds of pulling together a coalition of right-leaning nations by November 2017 to impose sanctions are fair, maybe 30%. That makes the odds of the second route completing by November 2017 about 17%. Overall, I put odds of a ""Yes"" outcome by November 2017 at about 22%."

It also depends on Iran of course and on the other major players; Russia, China and the EU. US sanction that are not supported by the other powers are unlikely to be be very effective. Over the last few decades the UK has acted as a bridge between the US and Europe which helped to get a common ""Western"" policy, with the UK no longer having a place at the EU table they are irrelevant. Without the UK the EU is likely to take the view that they have a deal with Iran and unless Iran blatantly breaks it they will want to keep trading, so the US should not expect EU support for sanctions. China wants access to multiple oil suppliers including Iran so is unlikely to want international sanctions again Iran. Russia and Iran are now best friends in boosting oil prices and pulling Syria and Iraq out of the Sunni/US sphere of influence, so don't expect Russia to want sanctions against Iran. So the US could be very isolated if it re-imposed sanctions on Iran. If a Trump lead US takes notice of any of this is not clear."
