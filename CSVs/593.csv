As far as earnings growth is concerned Msoft has been growing faster led by its cloud business (outlook here is good, with companies being forced to invest in increasing their digital footprint because of the pandemic,work from home etc) Also Xbox revenues though relatively small for now for Msoft are also soaring. They are making inroads into AI (with their latest acquisition of Nuance).

Just comparing current prices to Feb ones, there was a significant increase probably not justified by creation of value. My guess is there is a bubble that will burst with household savings being spent. Also, it seems that the winners from the pandemic are Apple and Amazon, for individual, stay-at-home reasons. Microsoft and Google also performed well, but not as well. The oil vs other cleaner energy. During this time, Aramco was relatively stable, about +10% variance to pre-COVID. Not that it makes a lot of sense with current oil prices compared to Feb. (just to compare, S&P 500 increased by 20% and DJIA by 18%). It doesn't seem reasonable that other options are considered in this situation and short period, and the barrel price could likely increase with activity. So, ""all"" is needed is Apple to drop about 16% to be below Market Cap of pre-COVID Aramco. At this point, it is more likely to happen than not. The other question would be In terms of the US companies and the competition between consumers and businesses. This is hard to say. The difference between Apple and Microsoft is huge, but the market correction, if there is any, would be too. Pre-COVID, both companies were aligned in Market Cap. My guess is that it will be slightly better for Microsoft or Amazon than for Apple, as business will still need their services, while fewer business will be open, but surely consumers will not need the latest iPhone or iPad.
