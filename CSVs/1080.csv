Since KY is trending towards its conservatism manifesting in republican voting, the latter figure is probably better. But, Bevin is highly unpopular, other statewide republicans are unpopular, there's an unusual amount of democratic funding, there's an unusual amount of democratic talent in the form of Beshear and McGrath, the polls are tied, Beshear is winning on endorsements, and Cook et al. labels the race a tossup. Arguments for Bevin seem only to be incumbency, down-ballot voting (which matters less outside of prez elections, where Trump may have been the biggest help), a reasonably good economy, and a possible KY polling skew towards Democrats. So, I think all of this revises the 33% up to 40%. Kentucky's governor results widely, so I gave the distributions fat tails. Beyond those descriptors, this is guesswork."

With this being said, Nov 2019 is a long ways off and a lot can happen between now and then to change public opinion causing votes to be changed.

Presently there is 2pt lead for Beshear, but polls don't much reflect anger or economic circumstances of Kentucky which hasn't fared so well with Trump Admin and Mitch McConnell's politicking. Neither has done much to help Kentucky. Coal mining is a done thing, physically dangerous. Stripping EPA safeguards and health protections only aggravates local hardships- and this lands back on future governor, state locals. McConnell is associated with Deripaska for circumventing Russian sanctions to create/ invest in Braidy aluminum plant in Kentucky touted by Bevin, but it was risky venture with Rusal/ Russian partner which exploded in public during Mueller Investigatons. Locals are the ones hurt, not Mitch McConnell or Bevin. It's complicated, but seems that Beshear name is more trusted and push back against what is seen to be exploitation, false promises and betrayal of GOP, McConnell, Bevin and Trump Admin which doesn't care about anybody. https://time.com/5651345/rusal-investment-braidy-kentucky/ Think the serious failures of GOP, the rollback of EPA regulations, healthcare problems, job losses all contribute to Democratic favor. Bashing Beshear as Clinton supporter isn't going to win votes when Trump is in office and Mitch McConnell claims to be the GrimReaper in killing legislation. Then there's Paul Rand who apparently only represents himself. Kentucky is also dead center to tornadoes going straight through Paducah, so any negative experience of Fema or emergency services and financial losses adds into the vote. No job, no healthcare,your house gets blown away by a tornado and no emergency support-- no GOP governor/ talking points.

Plus there is the problem of incompetents in EPA and USDA who haven't a clue what Invasive Species are or what kind of crop damage they inflict. Removing fact sheets from USDA or denying climate change doesn't change reality for farmers. It makes their lives more difficult. Every #GOP budget cut in any social/ state funding makes re-electing Bevin more difficult. When monoey is being siphoned off medicare or social welfare to be wasted on a spite wall in Texas or California while local infrastructure is neglected, re-electing Bevin is more difficult. Kentucky favored blue governors, but in future it will favor a governor that can listen and defend the problems it faces and problems facing state. Beshear as Atty Gen protected university and college funding which is backbone to economy and agriculture. These are real issues that matter for local people."
