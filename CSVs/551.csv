Rated the probability as 1% since there must be a non-zero probability that they abdicate.

94528,2022-01-23T01:50:36Z,1,[1.0],[1.0],Myanmar has a long history of military rule; the last interval lasted 22 years and the “roadmap to democracy” that was offered was widely condemned as a sham which would allow the military to maintain its power. It seems like the two primary factors which forced the military to at least make concessions to democracy were widespread unrest driven by economic decline and the personal popularity of Au Sang Suu Kyi. Another contributing factor may have been a desire to strengthen relations with the United States in order to reduce dependence on China.

104289,2022-01-18T22:49:02Z,1,[1.0],[1.0],Myanmar has a history of poor governance and now the military is back in control. There is no indication it seriously intends to give up power as soon as Feb 5.
104286,2022-01-18T22:23:38Z,1,[5.0],[5.0],"As I understand it, there is little domestic opposition to the military in Myanmar. They have successfully sidelined the country's foremost advocate for democratization and are trying her on a number of charges, some of which she unsurprisingly has been found guilty of already. The international community has responded with sanctions but appears incapable of effecting change in the country by any other means. The current Junta is however technically in place due to a year-long state of emergency declared in the wake of the last election, which is set to expire on Feb. 1st. I think it is unlikely that they abdicate by this deadline since the situation in the country appears to be so unstable, there don't appear to be other possible governing arrangements that would be acceptable to the military leaders, and historically, military leaders in situations such as the one in Myanmar are generally not quick to abdicate or defer to the rule of law."
104173,2022-01-18T20:08:07Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],The military has controlled the country for decades so it's unlikely to lose or give up that power in the next couple weeks.

104221,2022-01-14T02:16:18Z,1,[2.0],[2.0],Highly unlikely. After seizing power they have consolidated their position inside the country and given the current state of international affairs (pandemic and related troubles) there is little appetite for outside pressure.
104217,2022-01-13T18:24:11Z,1,[1.0],[1.0],"Highly unlikely that the military junta will cede control of Myanmar in the short term. The Junta's decision to even commit the coup, given its already privileged position, is evidence enough that the military has no visions of ceding control. ASEAN, arguably the only international body with some power in Myanmar, is splintered on the issue and concerned with the pandemic; not to mention that Myanmar has always treated ASEAN disrespectfully, second-rate compared to its relationship with China. I'd be more interested to see if Myanmar is expelled from ASEAN, although I doubt that too given Myanmar's boosters in the grouping. I imagine once the West starts getting even more distracted by domestic politics, i.e. the heat of mid-terms in the US or France's election, the Junta will be brought into the legitimate fold in ASEAN + other forums dominated by East Asian interests."

The military's influence over politics and economy remained significant also after the 2011 opening (25% of seats in the parliament reserved for the military, military conglomerates). Hence, the period of democratic rule in Myanmar is significantly shorter in the country's history since independence from Britain in 1948, providing the military with the capabilities to rule the country. Also other parameters of military rule remain the same, mostly importantly, regional powers continue the traditional policy of non-interference and are unlikely to apply sanctions or other restrictive measures against the junta, shielding the latter from EU/US sanctions. In addition, the (armed) opposition to the military, the Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAO) and newly established Popular Defense Units (PDU) do not have much in common apart from their opposition to the military and frictions over the course of action already emerged; EAOs may also use the current crisis to negotiate with the military. A difference to the pre-2011 period is the population's ability to stage a blockade of the large parts of the economy through the use of social media. However, the military's control of communication networks is likely to disrupt these networks. The impact of the blockage is also more likely to harm the population than the junta itself."

Citing voter fraud, the military mounted a coup that deposed the government and detained Aung San Suu Kyi and charged her with possessing illegally imported walkie-talkies. The electoral commission has derided the accusations of election fraud. Reported opinion is that the coup was conducted due to the USPD’S loss of seats and therefore power in the Parliament. This loss of power would deprive, it is said, the senior military general, Min Aung Hlaing’s personal ambition of becoming the President, where he had been raising his public profile by posting his activities on Facebook (later taken down by the site). Campaign groups have also suggested the threat to the General’s wealth and his family’s income stream as being an ulterior motive to regain power. He could also face accusations of war crimes against Rohingya Muslims and is the subject of cases pending in international courts that could seek his arrest. In the past foreign opinion and sanctions would appear to have little effect on the military government and this has been accentuated by the actions of Russia and China who have blocked the UN Security Council statement concerning the coup. Also, the near neighbours of Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines have declared it to be an ‘internal matter.’ The Military may have considered the recent visit by China’s foreign minister Wang Yi, who praised the Myanmar Generals and support for the ‘deserved role in the course of national transformation and development.’ to have provided a nod of acceptance of the coup. The Chinese news agency, Xinhua have described the coup as a ‘major cabinet reshuffle’ and by a refusal, by China to condemn it, may have given the Military extra confidence. History shows that the military will not necessarily step down in one year, given that it took twenty years from the 1990 election to complete a promised transition to democracy."

Looking at the history of military rule in Burma, the shortest interval of military rule seems to be two years and that was in the 1960s.[1] Since then, the military junta of the day has regularly extended its states of emergency for years of military dictatorship. As others have pointed out, Chinese support for the military government bilaterally and in international fora give the military regime cover at the UN."

China has blocked a UNSC resolution condemning the coup (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55913947) and is likely to continue providing economic support to Myanmar strengthening the position of the military. If the military turns over power before its one year declared emergency ends it would suffer a loss of legitimacy which is an outcome it is unlikely to accept. The factors that would increase the chance of the military handing over power are international sanctions that cripple the economy or hurt the generals' personal finances, pressure from China, or protests and strikes of a massive scale that make governing nearly impossible. All of this causes me to believe the chance of the military handing over power is low but not impossible."
