I previously made an assumption that the money used for the EVs would have to come from the government. With private investment, you could buy over 49K BUT it is not clear yet, that there is enough private investment. As a team, we have varying numbers of total number of chargers. As of today via https://afdc.energy.gov/stations/#/analyze?country=US&fuel=ELEC there are 45,842 total. @JasonSmith has a total of 5000 and @ricknsusan1314 using this link https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1089-july-8-2019-there-are-more-68800-electric-vehicle-charging-units shows 68,880. Think needs to be an agreement on how many there are today and how many have been added over last couple of years. According to https://afdc.energy.gov/data/10964 "" In 2021 alone, the number of charging stations grew by over 55%."" Even if it doubled again for 2022, if we believe the 1st number, that gives us approximately 92K, then the US would have to setting up 7666K per month and that is not happening. Therefore I have upped my previous percentage for fewer than 49K and down-checked everything else accordingly."

President Biden has pledged 500,000 new charging stations in an undetermined amount of time. Right now I assess that time to have the money allocated before the end of his term. Money asked for in the bipartisan infrastructure law for climate change/clean energy initiatives has been difficult to hold onto. As the President asked for 15B, he only received 7.5 which I am mostly assuming is from 2022-2026. If just taking basic averages, that would equate to installing 100,000/yr. Each Level 2, 2-charger pedestal and installation would cost $5813. @ 7.5B would give you 1,290,212 pedestals. Each Level 2, DC Fast charger pedestal and installation would cost $78,020 @ 7.5B would give you 96,129 pedestals. So in either case you are unable to get to total of 500,000 pedestals without some serious subsidies or something to offset the cost. Or you have to reduce the desired amount. And all of that adds up to, it is Mid-January therefore the 7.5B has likely been allocated, but would be difficult to spend, organize and finalize the number of pedestals we're discussing. Therefore, I think there will be fewer than 49,000 built by 29 April."

The Biden administration is proposing to grow that to 500k charging stations by 2030 (https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/574926-how-the-us-can-build-ev-charging-infrastructure-that-works). Even with the new infrastructure bill, it will likely take a few years for that growth to gain momentum and the growth will be exponentially higher as we approach 2030. For now, the growth is likely to remain relatively consistent with current levels about 7.3% as in Q1 2021 over Q4 2020.

If you download the Excel sheet it notes that these numbers were from as late in each year as possible, so sometime in December. They include private charging stations but if I drop that out of the current numbers private stations are only a couple thousand. Level 1 stations also seem to be negligible, so if they're counting those it shouldn't matter either. Current number is about 45,000, which is an increase of about 13.2k over December of 2020, or about a 40% increase. That's pretty huge and well above trend, and we're also looking at a 6 month period. So for my low end estimate I'll assume an increase of a quarter of that in 6 months, which would get us to 48.3k stations. For the high end I'll assume the same increase of about 13.2k, so about 58.2k. The average of those two numbers is about 53.3k.
