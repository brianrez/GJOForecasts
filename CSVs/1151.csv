Iran has been meddling in the daily affairs of Iraq since before the 2003 Allied Invasion and has been propping up the minority Shiits and their militias. These militias were instrumental in forming the ISIL military (along with disgruntleted former Iraqi military officers who were cast aside during the reconstruction period). After the destruction of ISIL in Syria, thousands of ISIL fighters systematically dispersed back into the surrounding communities and countries to include Iraq and Jordan. (This also happened after the 2003 invasion where the fighters would disperse and blend with the small towns in Northern and Southern Iraq, making identification and rooting them out very difficult."

However, there remains extremist groups that may coalesce to pose a threat, especially if the US pulls out of Iraq. This is possibly the only plausible scenario which would result in the question being answered as a ""Yes"" but the chances of this happening appear to be very low within the given timeframe. The 2018 election seems to have brought a bit more stability to Iraq and should reduce the risk of Shia/Shia infighting. The appointment of a Kurdish president may also help to reduce Government/Kurdish tensions. There is likely to be continued unrest in the Sunni population in the south, especially if rebuilding in the ex-IS controlled towns is delayed. However, it is difficult to see a situation where this could result in 1,000 civilian deaths by 31 March 2020."
