""After months of diplomatic haggling between China and the Philippines, the two may be moving toward an understanding on their competing claims in the South China Sea. On Aug. 29, China's ambassador to the Philippines, Zhao Jinhua, announced that Beijing was willing to hold bilateral talks with Manila and would ""look into the possibility"" of allowing Filipino fishermen to fish in the disputed waters, particularly around the Scarborough Shoal.

What is different this time is how widespread the opposition is, including in some countries like Australia and the U.K. that traditionally have been more sympathetic to China. “We’re seeing an unprecedented level of political backlash globally against Chinese investment and in particular Chinese acquisitions,” said Thilo Hanemann, an economist with the New York-based Rhodium Group, who tracks capital flows worldwide. The flash points are proliferating. Billion-dollar Chinese investments in a Royal Philips NV unit and computer disk maker Western Digital Corp. collapsed this year amid concerns that the U.S. would block them on national security grounds. German lawmakers have expressed concern over Chinese investments in Kuka AG, with the government there unsuccessfully trying to find a European buyer for the robot maker (para 9-10)."

Three others were injured from the missile's collision, which was launched from a 500-ton Ching Chiang-class guided-missile patrol vessel during a missile exercise in Zuoying naval port in the southern city of Kaohsiung.

Assuming that the most likely scenario for another mid-air incident is between the US and China, then that suggests a probability on the order of 1/5600, assuming the US flies through the area every day. China has been stepping up it's aerial activities and aggression in the area recently, I seem to be able to recall recently news of 2 close calls of similar incidents between the US and China air power projection. Even a ten fold increase in the observed risk would only mean a roughly 0.2% chance of some similar incident to happen. The probability of a purposeful military operation that causes human casualties is likely significantly less than 1%, as it does not appear to be in anyone's strategic interests to do so. The interaction between coast guards, like the incident with the Indonesian coast guard's capture of a Chinese fishing vessel, seems to be the most likely mode for some interaction to lead to a fatality. A European Maritime Safety Agency report for 2013 shows that there were 75 fatalities with 2782 ships involved. Each incident may have involved more than one fatality (this includes the grounding of a ferry off the coast of Italy that claimed 25 lives) but also more than one ship may have been involved in a single incident. If those two adjustments cancel, then we get a guess of just under 3% probability of a fatal incident occurring from some sort of a ship to ship interaction. Given that fishing ships are constantly trolling the area (both legally and illegally), the opportunity for some sort of confrontation seems high (perhaps occurring on a daily basis), though the chance of a ramming like the one this March is likely significantly lower than that. If we guess there are somewhere between 2 and 3 incidents of a ship to ship contact from now till the end of the year, that gives a probability that one of these will end in a fatality between 5 and 8%. Call that 6.5%. Plus 0.5% for the chance of an aerial incident plus all other less likely scenarios combined and 7% seems a decent guess."

21935,2016-06-14T10:24:44Z,1,[13.0],[13.0],"China's power projection into the South China Sea has become increasingly bellicose and it's rhetoric increasingly aggressive. The opportunity to open a dialogue in March at the nuclear summit in Japan was passed over and there seem to be few opportunities in the coming months to seek better coordination. It is unlikely in the extreme that an intentional lethal confrontation would arise, however China does have a history of engaging in erratic and risky behavior. Any lethal confrontation is most likely to arise from a miscalculation by the individuals involved in operations in the area. For example the mid air collision of a Chinese fighter with a US spy plane in 2001 was most likely due to the reckless behavior of the Chinese pilot. More recently China has been known to ram free fishing vessels that have been captured by Coast Guards operating in the South China Sea (most notably Indonesia). With the introduction of China's new, larger, and armed Coast Guard vessels, their aggressive tactics are likely to continue and the chance for an accident to occur is meaningful."

One of the reasons for this sudden decision is the expected ruling on territorial claims in the South China Sea by the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague. The Hong Kong daily’s source affirmed that “Beijing will take action to carry out land reclamation at Huangyan Island within this year. China should regain the initiative to do so because Washington is trying to contain Beijing by establishing a permanent military presence in the region.”"

A Chinese coast guard vessel quickly intervened to prevent the Indonesian Navy from towing away the fishing boat, setting off a diplomatic row. Beijing does not claim the Natunas but said the boats were in ""traditional Chinese fishing grounds"". China claims almost all of the South China Sea. The Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Brunei also have conflicting claims over the islets and atolls that constitute the Spratly Archipelago and its rich fishing grounds. State-controlled fishing companies dominate the fleets that go regularly to the Spratlys and are recipients of much of the militia training and subsidies, industry sources said. China has by far the world's biggest fish industry, but depleted fishery resources close to China's shores have made fishing in disputed waters an economic necessity, fishermen and industry executives say. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-china-fishingboats-idUSKCN0XS0RS ++++++++ Bringing it up a little, for the reasons above."

Keeping all other figures unchanged, the overall probability is 8.9%, round up to 9%. In terms of inside view, the changes I noticed are mostly in the South China Sea: Reasons for increasing: 1. China is putting more emphasis on the region, building artificial islands in the Spratly which included an airstrip. Also note that other countries already have artificial islands built with airstrips, so China is just catching up for now. 2. US involvement by sending USS Lassen within 12 nautical miles of Subi Reef. From my readings it seems that the US is sending a mild message that it doesn’t recognize the legitimacy of this artificial island."

Looking at the past 7 encounters, all of them have the potential to evolve into a lethal confrontation, so I put the probability of next one becoming a lethal one as 10%, just because it feels right. There is also a probability of un-intentional event causing 3+ death, call it 1% (maybe refine it later?).

This could be as simple as a PRC jet getting tangled up with a US spy plane or fighter by flying too close or a PRC vessel firing on another regional country's vessel operating in the area. Either way the Chinese want to be seen as more of a force and this means not allowing random states to just wander through their backyard.

The basic problems are well known, in my opinion these include: public and private debt; restructuring the SOEs; rebalancing the economy; land grabs and corrupt local authorities; control of the equity and currency markets; the expanding anti-corruption purge, its targets and effects; capital flight; lack of international engagement beyond investment flows, and no substantial or reputable friends (e.g. Russia, North Korea, Cambodia, Pakistan, Myanmar has left, Venezuela might be leaving); fear of containment; and an inability to accept a multi-power and multilateral world. A less obvious factor might be 'peak stuff' in the industrial economies, which could impact exports of consumer goods while emerging economies are in recession and internal demand is still weak. I think many of these chickens will be coming home to roost in 2016, and authoritarian regimes under pressure tend to be aggressive, this is one side of my high probability. Note this is not a 'China collapse' scenario, its more like a 'rough patch with consequences'. The other side of the scenario is possible actions by one or some of the other littoral states. There are several wildcards in play here, including: Vietnamese arms acquisitions and increased capabilities (particularly the submarines); progress of the Philippine case against China in the Hague; the Taiwanese election on Jan 16 and the effect of a pro-independence result, especially if the KMT loses the legislature as well as the presidency; increased maritime surveillance by these, and by Malaysia and Indonesia, will be seen as provocative by China as it attempts to enforce its imaginary boundary. The escalating number and intensity of fishing disputes between China (using their fishing fleet for geopolitical purposes), Vietnam and the Philippines, creates further opportunities for a military or coastguard response to a major clash. A Vietnamese fishing boat was reported as sunk by a Chinese 'vessel' last September. I do not think there will be a direct confrontation with Japan or the US. However, China has created the conditions for conflict in the South China Sea, where it clearly has no interest in diplomatic solutions. While continually testing the resolve of these other countries by incursions, China may be forced by its own rhetoric to respond with force to an attempt to enforce an EEZ."

Digging in to the Correlates of War's militarized interstate dispute dataset (http://www.correlatesofwar.org), I could only find a handful of incidents that would satisfy (or come close to satisfying) the conditions laid out in this question: - 2001: a Chinese pilot died after colliding with a U.S. spy plane (though this wouldn't quite meet the 3 fatality threshold) - 1988: ~70 Vietnames sailors died after Chinese and Vietnamese forces clashed over Johnson South Reef - 1974: ~70 sailors died as China seized the Paracel Islands from Vietnam Given the low baseline for military-to-miitary clashes in the South China Sea, I don't think its likely that we will see a planned military engagement in the South China Sea before January 2017. Though with tensions on the rise and significant military activity in the area , there's always a chance for accidents (like the 2001 collision between Chinese and US planes)."

The outgoing party would have nothing to lose by turning the other cheek, or a blind eye, and forgetting about any treaty obligations to come to the rescue of a democratic Taiwan. The incoming party wouldn't be sworn in to office until January and thus would have no means to do anything, even if they wanted to, about a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.

If such an event occurred, defense treaties with Japan and the Philippines may compel the U.S. into greater involvement. According to a White House figure, 5.2 trillion in trade passes through the South China Sea each year. In addition, natural resources in the South China Sea increase the areas economic potential. The rise of nationalist rhetoric (from all sides), the increases in military spending in the region, and the historical grievances between China and some of its neighbors (notably, Japan), combine for a very dangerous mix of variables. It is true that the costs (economic and political) of an incident and the potential for an even greater escalation (should something occur) are high. However, a miscalculation or a rapid chain of events would likely override reasonable thoughts about such costs.

The Economist reviewed a book by Bill Hayton in 2014 (The South China Sea: The Struggle for Power in Asia). The review ends this way: ""[Hayton] ... became convinced that Chinese leaders understand they would lose a shooting war and are desperate to avoid it, using instead what they call 'the period of strategic opportunity' to build up China’s strength. Since [the Chinese] know the other side must grasp this, however, they have to appear belligerent. This is an intriguing argument. But this strategy is so vulnerable to miscalculation, misperception and sheer bad luck, that it is not a very reassuring one."" I agree that a lethal confrontation is more likely to be accidental than deliberate, like the incident with the US reconnaissance aircraft a few years ago that was damaged by reckless maneuvers of a Chinese interceptor, with the loss of the interceptor and the death of its pilot, and the emergency landing of the US plane in Chinese territory, and its subsequent internment. The recent foray of the USS Lassen was accompanied by maneuvers by ""Chinese fishing vessels"" — in reality likely local Chinese maritime militia vessels — cutting across the bow of the Lassen. Such maneuvers could easily lead to fatal incidents."

China takes the long view, it appears the motivation is economic in nature, but the natural resources believed present will take a long time to ""mine"". In the long term, global resources will dwindle and mining at sea will become economic. By continuing to assert their claim, eventually, perhaps they can get an international body to recognize at least a part of them. Also, their military prowress grows and has to be trained and maintained, hence the sorties and ""aggression"". China is a well developed society and follows its traditions and tenets faithfully, not prone to knee-jerk reactions.

I see little chance of Chinese naval/ coast guard being involved in lethal confrontation before Jan '17. Vietnam, Philippines and other nations' navies and coast guard are less coordinated with command and lack a coordinated, front line civilian maritime element to confront foreign civilian vessels in disputed waters. Herien lies a greater risk for lethal confrontation with Chinese civilian vessels. But Chinese fishing and other civilian maritime vessels tend to be backed up by sate naval and / or coast guard assets, thereby reducing a chance for a lethal confrontation involving Vietnamese, Philippine or other naval coast guard vessels. The elephant of the US navy makes it difficult and disadvantageous for China to engage in any potential military confrontation in disputed waters/ islands in S or E China sea for the immediate future. Japan's new interpretation of its pacifist constitution and the alliance withe US makes any E China sea confrontation unlikely. The Philippine navy is too weak and almost totally relies on the US which lowers any risk of lethal confrontation with its naval or coast guard forces. Vietnam is more exposed and poses the greatest risk, but it is growing closer to the US militarily and economically quickly and may be in position to expect US backing in the coming few years. Almost all risk is with Vietnam in my opinion. http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/naval/2015/11/02/china-lassen-destroyer-spratly-islands-south-china-sea-andrew-erickson-naval-war-college-militia-coast-guard-navy-confrontation-territorial-dispute/75070058/ http://thediplomat.com/2015/01/what-awaits-vietnam-in-2015/ http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/10/27/south-china-sea/"

This balance and unpredictability in China's presentation, as well as the very real economic leverage it possesses over the other countries in the east-china-sea region to refrain from any insurrectionist activity that may eventually cost them. The stakes are much higher for China's opposition if they oppose the territorial embankment of the region so I think they will just stand by and allow it to happen without much rebuttal, to China's advantage (since I don't believe, China is looking for regional conflict either.) Japan is the only country with some amount of international political leverage, connectivity and influence (despite their debt which does limit what their able to do economically to resist China's assertion of control of the region and its resources.) Japan may well rally the other countries in the region and with the support of the US and the EU, may be able to mount some opposition to China's advancement or at least slow the process through international negotiations.

3433,2015-11-03T20:42:57Z,1,[8.0],[8.0],"Possible but highly unlikely. As China is focusing on projecting itself as a serious contender on the world stage, I expect it will guide it's soldiers in the region to show extreme restraint, as any incident would increase domestic pressure to retaliate, potentially leading to instiability that the Chinese leadership tries to avoid at all costs. Thus, even an inadvertent incident from the Chinese side is highly unlikely. Higher risk seems to stem from the smaller players in the region. However, given Chinas size and firepower, avoiding direct confrontation would be in the national interest of the smaller players. The greatest unknown would then be Japan with it's renewed drive to project assertiveness, but given the high standards of the Japanese training for its self-defense forces and police, a confrontation seems even more unlikely. Thus the 8% are a pessimistic acknowledgement of the possibility of tail events caused by deranged individuals."
