Although it's unlikely Congress will settle with the amendments supported by these companies, it's more likely that the statute will be amended than repealed. Repeal is a dramatic remedy, and there does not seem to be support for that in Congress either. Trump will be out of office soon and will lose clout over the issue; he has recently called for repeal, and threatened to veto budget bills over it. That issue goes away soon."

THe only remaining chance is if it is put into a year-long appropriations package being debated by Congress. This would be highly unlikely at this point. However, given Speaker's Pelosi's recent announcement that Section 230 does need reform, those interested should keep an eye out in 2021 for possible reform proposals."
96831,2020-12-15T02:44:13Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"The House and Senate both approved the NDAA, and would likely override a veto with a 2/3 vote. Specifically, it was approved in the house with a veto-proof majority. From the Reuters article: ""A successful veto override would be the first of Trumpâ€™s four-year presidency. He has had eight sustained."" However, looking at the legislation as a separate issue from the NDAA, Section 230 would probably be better off suited as a separate issue from National Security (I believe the argument that it is a national security issue is weak). https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-defense-trump-idUSKBN28N0O5 https://www.cnet.com/news/house-approves-defense-spending-bill-with-veto-proof-majority/ https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/trump-to-congress-repeal-section-230-or-ill-veto-military-funding/"

12573,2020-12-13T19:33:29Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"Doubtful. The defense spending bill veto will be overridden by both houses of Congress and become law without this modification. I wonder if anyone argued in court that this law is prima facie illegal, since it was written in direct contravention of the First Amendment (""Congress...shall make no law against the freedom of speech...."")."
96746,2020-12-13T18:49:15Z,1,[0.0],[0.0],"Absolutely not. While there is a growing movement to address Section 230, POTUS does not have the leverage to force action through a veto. He may in fact veto the NDAA. If he does, Congress will most likely override the veto with a 2/3 majority in each chamber (the NDAA was passed in both the House and Senate with what would be veto proof majorities). Another possible scenario is waiting until 21 January to sign the NDAA...but the impact to service members will make that difficult politically. The least likely scenario, all but impossible, is that Congress allows a lame duck president to force them into addressing the 1996 Telecommunications Act by holding national defense and special military pay over their heads."
