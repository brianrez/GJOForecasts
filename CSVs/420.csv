You then have the fact that the US is still providing air support (and looks likely to continue to do so), and that the Taliban's gains so far have been predominantly limited to the countryside. It also gets very cold in Kabul over winter, so if we presume that (a) the Taliban will likely need to take the capital in order for the government to fall and (b) it will be harder to take over winter, then the timeframe for action really is tight. None of these factors on their own make it impossible, but I think together they reduce the probability to around the 5% figure."

There is ample precedent for the US flying its puppets to safety once they have ceased to be even marginally useful; the only actual question is, I think, whether this eventuality will occur before this deadline. Seems to be no solid reason to think otherwise. He might make it to Michaelmas, but he will be dead or gone or both by Boxing Day."

There is not a lot of confidence being shown in the Afghan army to defend the country and the air support required by the armed forces and depended upon by the outgoing US administration will be lost due to the withdrawal of US soldiers and contractors and the resultant loss in maintenance of aircraft. The Taliban control strategic areas along borders with central Asian states including key trade routes. Ashraf Ghani has lost the foreign troops protecting his position. His armed forces would appear to be ineffective or inadequate or not willing and the Taliban are confident in obtaining power by force. His only hope could lie with China that would like to use Afghanistan’s strategic location as a trade hub with links to the Middle East, Central Asia and Europe. The Chinese maybe wary given that Afghanistan has never been colonized, resisted all foreign invaders such as the British, Russia and the US. The trade hub would depend on peace and stability, two issues not known in Afghanistan and history shows that foreign intervention for those power’s advantages have been repelled without any regard for trade or economics. I will suggest that Ashraf Ghani’s tenure as President is not secure and has few allies who want to enmesh themselves in another conflict with the tribes of Afghanistan. Only the timing of his departure is in question. https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/13/asia/afghanistan-taliban-commandos-killed-intl-hnk/index.html https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/militia-commanders-rush-aid-afghan-forces-against-taliban-2021-07-09/"

Without close air support Kabul and waging asymmetrical warfare with US supported militias on all borders other than Pakistan rout poss by October 1. At this point Abdullah Abdullah may be better bet. 10 to 20 percent chance cease fire talks cease Abdullah takes over. At best we can hope for long stalemate Closing Bagram dumb Better send Warthogs and train Afghan pilots and expand intelligence assets covert. Send message to Iran PRC and Pak and world, No rout will occur most likely but national government a failure"
