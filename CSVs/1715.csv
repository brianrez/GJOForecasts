"Between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018, will an armed group from the Central African Republic engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in the Central African Republic?",2017-03-31T17:00:53Z,2017-07-01T06:59:53Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],239,654,77,237,"The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (Early Warning Project). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 30 June 2017 and will be resolved in April 2018 after EWP assesses the situation in the Central African Republic from April 2017 to March 2018. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilians fatalities occur in one or more campaigns. See (Early Warning Project) for examples. See (GJ Open) for GJâ€™s FAQ on forecasting questions like this. Confused?

The nation has 7 major ethnic groups within the country and the population distribution leaves the ethnic groups with lower populations at high risk. War crimes are continuous and blatant. Around 11% of the population is estimated to have the HIV virus or AIDS. The median age is around 20 years old, compared to the US median age of 37. In my opinion, reading the facts of the nation and its current state is like reading a recipe for genocide. It may even currently be taking place. I believe an armed group from the Central African Republic will engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians from the Central African Republic before April 1, 2018."
