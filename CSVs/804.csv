It will go down farther cat the end of August. Once we hit the Jewish hi holidays and the election season in the US, it would put the Annex discussion in a holding pattern until the new cards are placed.

The problem is that Bibi needs one of these just to start the conversation and release the sovereignty plan at which point a lot of Israeli's will have input. I still think there is a sort of ""soft annexation"" that he might try to push through in September assuming covid numbers stabilize.

Annexation is illegal under International law and this proposed action has created opprobrium from International actors with one exception that is the Trump administration. The proposed date of July 1st, 2020 has passed. Israel now has a coalition government that has created a degree of stability, politically, for the moment. The Trump Presidency provides the best opportunity for Israel to act and it will only act with the permission of the White House, who are preoccupied with Covid-19, the economy and the upcoming Presidential elections. Russia, a major player in the region, after its annexation of the Crimea would not interfere. The Gulf States appear to be disinterested. Annexation could/would provide further disruption in the Middle East and raise the profile of Palestinians. +/- 30% of Israelis oppose annexation. Without collecting the opprobrium of the International theatre and considering 400,000 Israelis already settled in the West Bank and thereby creating a ‘creeping sovereignty’ there would only be political advantage to a formal annexation. However, due to Covid-19 and criticism of Netanyahu over the handling of the pandemic plus the effect on the country’s economy have redirected attention away from annexation, for the time being. I propose that the Knesset will not pass a bill to annex and/or apply sovereignty before January 1, 2021"

Otaiba was one of three Arab Ambassadors who attended the “historical ceremony” at the White House last January when President Trump unveiled his Middle East peace proposal, engineered by his son-in-law Jared Kushner and U.S. ambassador to Israel David Friedman. Meanwhile, a popular non-violent struggle across the Palestinian territories is gaining momentum, with the encouragement of PA president Mahmoud Abbas himself. As Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki recently noted.Hamas head Ismail Haniya declared that it was “the duty of each free Palestinian citizen to rise up” against the annexation plans; Salah al-Bardawil, a senior Hamas official, called for the launch of “a popular revolution everywhere.” The only Arab state which has not diluted its words is Jordan, which shares a long border with Israel and which would bear the brunt of political instability and a potential refugee influx. Amman expressed its total rejection of the plan and King Abdullah has conducted last-minute in-person lobbying in the White House. Jordan, as one of only two Arab states with signed peace deals with Israel, has the tangible option of withdrawing its ambassador, an act which could send that 1994 treaty into a state of limbo. https://www.israpundit.org/gulf-states-outrage-on-israels-annexation-is-empty-bluff/"
