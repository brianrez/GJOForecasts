Here's a part that's especially relevant to this question: ""Hungary presents a puzzle for the EU, as it prepares to roll out its first rule of law report assessing the bloc’s 27 member countries on September 30 ... few expect it [the EU] to stop Orbán’s abuse of the rule of law ... while it [the EU] formally triggered Article 7 proceedings against Warsaw in 2017, it did not do so for Budapest ... It was only after the European Parliament acted in 2018 and formally triggered Article 7 that proceedings were started against Hungary ... There is a sense in the Council — even among some governments that dislike Orbán's policies — that Article 7 should be avoided. The worry is that isolating a member country could put further pressure on the bloc even as it is still recovering from the United Kingdom’s decision to leave"" [2]."

There does appear to be reticence by the EU to punish Orban due to political considerations. Fidesz is the political party of the Hungarian President Orban and belongs to the centre right European People’s Party (EPP) grouping within the European Parliament that includes Merkel and Veradkar. They do not want to isolate Orban due to his ability to supply votes and therefore maintaining the group’s influence. This was in April 2018. In September 2018, the Eu Parliament voted to issue Article 7 (1) to Hungary, which opens the door to sanctions, but Article 7 can only be enacted if all the EU members agree, which is problematical as Poland is in a similar position to Hungary and they will support each other. The EU is currently distracted by the Coronavirus pandemic, Brexit and the resultant budgetary woes. Hungary has also become the largest recipient of EU aid to combat the outcomes of the pandemic even though the country suffered less than others within the EU Community. Therefore, the chances of Hungary being subjected to Article 7 would appear to be slim. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/04/europe-hungary-viktor-orban-coronavirus-covid19-democracy/609313/"
