The advance estimate, which measures quarter-on-quarter growth using seasonally adjusted annual rates, for Q4 2016 can be found here (Bureau of Economic Analysis). The question will be suspended on 30 June 2017 and closed when Q2 data are released, typically in late July.

Based on this, I give higher weight to the Atlanta model, but both models now point to the 2-3% range. Given the overprediction of the NY Fed model, I also give some probability to the 1-2% bucket."
