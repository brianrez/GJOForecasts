Even if there is a heat-sensing (infra-red) satellite or ship, any warmth from the submarine would have long since been distributed among millions of gallons of water. That leaves sonar and radar. The platforms hosting those sensors have to be relatively close to an object to detect it, once on the sea floor. I have heard that there is magnetic sensing. I do not know of what substance this submarine is constructed. Even so, the little which I have read about this method of detection indicates that, again, the sensor must be relatively vertical to the object for it to be found."
