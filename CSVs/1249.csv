What will be the 2019 industry-wide average cost of Li-ion batteries used in battery-powered electric vehicles?,2018-11-16T18:00:48Z,2020-01-01T07:59:48Z,More than $155 but less than $170 per kWh,"['Less than $140 per kWh', 'Between $140 and $155 per kWh, inclusive', 'More than $155 but less than $170 per kWh', 'Between $170 and $185 per kWh, inclusive', 'More than $185 kWh']",['Technology'],492,654,191,237,"Lowering the cost of battery packs through R&D investments, manufacturing improvements, and economies of scale is a major consideration for bringing down the price of battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs) and making them more competitive with gasoline-fueled internal combustion engines (China Dialogue, Financial Times). This question will be suspended on 31 December 2019 and resolved using the Mack Institute's analysis for 2019, which will replicate an approach published in a 2015 Nature Climate Change study (The Stockholm Environment Institute). The Mack Institute found that ""there was a 16% annual decline in the cost of battery packs between 2007 and 2017, and the industry-wide average cost of battery packs in 2017 was US $236 per kWh"" (The Mack Institute).

In 2018, the average cost was $176 kWh per Bloomberg NEF. What is the likelihood that cost reductions continue? 1. Will demand for batteries continue to be strong? Yes. China is the leader in Li-ion battery production (has about 75% of the world's production capacity) and is the leader in EV and EV bus sales. Due to strong governmental policy support and rising commitments from OEM's in China and globally, demand will continue to be strong for EV's and EV buses which will drive production and competition for Li-ion batteries. Being price competitive with ICE is crucial to EV sales numbers and adoption rates. Li-ion battery price reductions are the easiest way to get to that tipping point which encourages continued R&D investments to reduce Li-ion battery costs. What are potential disruptions to this decline in costs of Li-ion batteries? 1. Commodity supplies and prices - Li-ion batteries are sensitive to lithium, nickel, cobalt, and aluminum supplies and prices with Cobalt looking to be the most important commodity due to it scarcity. While Cobalt is a growing concern, it is not likely to impact prices, etc. until early 2020. In addition, wild swings in commodity prices have a fairly negligible impact on overall battery costs. 2. New technology - a lot of news about replacing the Li-ion battery with other technology, specifically solid state batteries. This technology is likely 5 years out so not likely to impact Li-ion demand/costs in near term. 3. News out of Korea - Samsung and LG are rumored to be looking at increasing their battery price contracts by 10% in upcoming supply agreements. Even if this happens, I don't see it impacting industry-wide averages very much this year. On the whole, I anticipate a continued decrease in average costs of Li-ion batteries on par or even greater than what we have seen over the last several years."

In other words, the costs of a battery are not purely a function of manufacturing (+material) costs, but also of the profit margin on top of those costs. If margins rise, the overall cost of the battery might decline more slowly than it previously has. Bloomberg suggests this has contributed to a smaller price drop in 2018 than would have otherwise been seen: ""While today’s short-term shortage has forced some battery buyers to pay a premium, prices on average have nonetheless fallen this year"""
