I think Stacey Abrams built an African-American centric turnout machine that got Biden elected in a red state a few weeks ago. She will keep that machine working. Obama will be active in Atlanta. Warnock will keep African-American turnout high and help Ossof. Both Loeffler and Perdue are the subject of serious insider trading scandals. Trump is stoking a civil war in the Republican party, frequently attacking the Governor and SoS of Georgia. Still it is a red state and some small amount of ticket-splitting can impact this probability."

Thus, the remaining two special senate races in Georgia are the determinants of this issue as the current balance in the senate will be 46(D) - 50 (R) - 2 (I) [Note the I's caucus with Democrats). The presidential election showed local races still favor the GOP in historically GOP areas (for example Maine), but that the President underperformed local candidates in many areas except when a large Latino population was present (Maine, Georgia). Presidential elections also see higher turnout which generally favors republicans. Loeffler is an unpopular candidate and may lose her reelection (or is it still reelection if you were never elected in the first place?), but Purdue seems unlikely to lose as an incumbent. Further, given that Perdue's failure to secure 50% of the vote in the previous election seems to have been due to a Libertarian candidate (Shane Hazel) and his challenger his fairly socially progressive with respect to Georgia at large. Nevertheless, polls show both senate races in a dead heat (with Perdue slightly ahead of Ossoff and Loeffler tied or slightly behind Warnock), but given that polls have been slightly biased against republicans and democrats have to flip both seats to gain the senate this seems unlikely. I would estimate that the base rate odds of a dead heat race for both are 50-50, but given that Republicans only need one win that is a 25% - 75% ratio for R-D. Factoring in the lower turnout from an off-cycle election, the unpopularity of Loeffler, and the incumbency of Perdue I would estimate the most likely outcome is a Perdue victory and a Warnock victory splitting the Senate 47(D)-51(R)-2(I). The likelihood that democrats unseat Perdue and Loeffler seems low. (15%)"

That would lead to a 50/50 split with VP Harris giving the Democrats control of the Senate. It looks like President-Elect Biden will soon have enough states certify in his favor to bring President Trump's challenges to an end. Once the result is finalized there is a good chance Trump will drop out of the public eye for a while, and as a result, voter turnout in support of the two Republican candidates in Georgia will suffer. Both sides will be highly motivated, but Democrats, led by Stacey Abrams, will likely be better organized and will again vote early in bigger numbers than Republicans. Georgia has an interesting history of runoffs that have generally favored Republicans, but the recent results are indicating a possible shift in the blue direction. https://insideelections.com/news/article/a-brief-history-of-georgia-runoffs-and-why-this-time-may-be-different"

A multitude of candidates ran for the special seat, and their totals add up to almost an even number between democrats and independents on one hand, and for republicans and libertarians on the other. There is the ability for new voters to register until early December, and that means that those who became eligible to vote since early October will likely be recruited to vote, bolstering democratic ranks. I think that this, along with events that will continue to be interpreted as Republican neglect like stalling on a large stimulus plan, and continued deaths from the Corona virus, will hurt the appointed senator. However, the current US Senator running for re-election, seems to have the incumbent's advantage, and will likely survive his challenge. Being that the question is framed as an either or type question, where Democrats take the house and senate, or they don't, I would say that there is a very low chance that democrats will win both chambers."

Our polling predicted the results as they were at 3 am on November 3rd. Whatever happened afterwards is contrary to how 5000+ representative sample have been voicing their opinions.

Odds tracking puts the Reps maintaining control of the Senate at +138, losing control at +110, and a 50-50 split at +450, meaning there aren't really any true favorites here but the most likely scenario for bookies is that they lose it. This becomes especially apparent when we consider that a 50-50 split here would fall to the Presidency (for the purposes of this question) which most agree is likely swinging blue this cycle. With the SC race now a toss-up, this becomes even more interesting.

Neither party, on base rates, is extremely likely to have a majority in either house. We can estimate the probability that a party wins both houses as a conjunction of the probability that they win each house. Additionally, we can look at the current breakdown of party affiliation in each house as relevant knowledge since we know that incumbents have a large advantage in winning elections, so each house is slightly more likely to remain controlled by the current majority party than it is to flip. I assign a higher probability to Dems having House and Reps winning senate than either winning the other for this reason. I haven't looked into how many elections this cycle are competitive and how many competitive elections are faced by each party's incumbents, so i can't give great estimates here. I suspect that democrats have a slight edge in winning elections broadly this cycle since 1) younger generation has a larger percentage of voting than last cycle and they are disproportionately liberal. 2) Economy is currently bad which usually indicates dissatisfaction with current government which is perceived to be republican lead since the president is republican. 3) Older people who are more likely to be conservative are less likely than normal to go vote in person due to coronavirus concerns, though i do not think this is a very big factor."

The Trump administrations attacked on Biden have been drowned out by how the pandemic has been handled. The senate is harder to predict because there is less gerrymandering involved and it represents a more diverse set of voters per seat. I think because young people are passionate about personal interractions, and because they are upset about losing out on prom and not being able to be around friends as much, they will finally turn out at a decent rate and vote for democratic nominees since most of the blame of the pandemic is being placed on the shoulders of republicans.

If the election were today, I'd say the Dems would sweep, but its not today, its almost 3 months away, so anything could happen. If Trump begins to take the virus seriously, he may gain momentum going into the election. If a vaccine is released, focus may shift away from healthcare topics. If the economy surges on the coattails of a successful reopening and people are voting based on jobs numbers and new paychecks, that could swing in the GOPs favor. If Trump and the GOP start sending out checks with the president's name on them to every citizen just a few weeks before the election, that may win enough brownie points to dig the Republicans out of the hole they are in. Maybe these are all unlikely (I personally think the plan is something along the last one and has been for some time now), but together they all suggest that the GOP has a good chance at being gifted a few seats here and there and circumstances change."

We also see that 9% of the seats in the House are not safe, but lean towards or likely will go to the Democrats, while 8% lean towards the Republicans. That leaves a total of 5% of the seats in the house that could go either way. Barring some kind of tectonic demographic shift, there is just not enough at play in this election to see the Republicans taking back the House.

We also see that 9% of the seats in the House are not safe, but lean towards or likely will go to the Democrats, while 8% lean towards the Republicans. That leaves a total of 5% of the seats in the house that could go either way. Barring some kind of tectonic demographic shift, there is just not enough at play in this election to see the Republicans taking back the House. The Republicans would have to win all of the seats that could go either way (5%) plus over half of the seats that lean towards the Democrats (5%), plus not lose any of the unsafe seats.

However, I follow the site, FiveThirtyEight and have knowledge of some of their predictions and analysis. I also follow some other news sites (disclosure: I am not American - I am a Canadian living in Hong Kong). 3) I assume (based on my reading of news, polls etc) that there is nearly zero chance that Republicans can win the House. I also assume the fact that Biden is winning in the presidential polls currently means there will be some tendency towards higher Democratic turnout in senate voting. 4) My base rate is betfair betting market which seems to currently give the Dems a 35-40 percent chance of winning a majority in both houses. However, again I am assuming here that “control” by Dems could be 50/50 with a Dem VP elected. For purposes of this question, I give Dems roughly a 65% chance to elect the President VP (which is a bit higher now than, but consistent with, betting markets). 5) I am also aware of a recent prediction of a FiveThirtyEight analyst that the “base case” right now is 51+ Dem senators. So if I average that with the (say) 40% chance as implied by betting markets(which I adjust upwards to 42% based on my own evaluation), I get say 47.5-50% chance of Dem’s having 51+ senators. 6) I don’t have a clear sense of what are the chances of exactly 50 senators each, but betting markets seem to imply about a 15-20% chance. Also, I see from Google search that currently, the only independents in the Senate caucus with the Dems, so I am making a simplifying assumption that such independents who caucus with one party can effectively be considered part of that party (ie part of its ""control""). I also notice the question doesn't seem to allow the possibility of neither party controlling a branch - so I will make no offsetting adjustment for such possibility. 7) My calculation based on the above gives very close to 60% chance of Dems controlling both houses (ie my choice of 60% is not a rounding to nearest 5 or 10 percent)."

Individulas are unpredictable, systems and trends tend to not be. Its very rare for a senate to swing, however, there only needs to be a swing of 3 seats for dems to win which I think is more in the realms of possibility than not. Most estimates on this board havent assessed data regarding the potential levels of varaince in the voter base which could cause this swing. Keep your eyes on yougovs pendulum, average decline of perceived well handling of the pandemic is decreasing by 2% eveyry few days in the US. This is likely to be huge voting point, the conditions of the pandemics and riots themselves may also be likely to disrupt the vote, which will also affect my forecast updates. combine this with an average global governemnt approvla of about 30% this can be assumed to be fairly constant in its influence on undecided or swing voters. However, a ten point drop in dissaporval only accounts for a change in about 2.3% of vote share with modern UK elections having a poor confidence interval. This combined with the PEW research datas info on dissaproval allowed me to synthesise a potentially changing vote shar of between 4-13.8%. PEW also had good data on opinions, current event perception and qualities of each candidates. Biden looks leading because his insipidness makes him very electable, however, polls suggests most people are using him as a f*** trump vote just like hillary, we saw how that turned out (not to indulge in Gamblers fallacy). finally, comparing these to paddy powers odds I came to the reasonable assumpton that there was an 8 percent variance in the current electorate regarding across the voteshare, mostly favouring dems becuase trump people hate trump more and neutrals hate trump more which still leaves trump with a solid base. I'll be revising the data in line to covid basedd approvals, particularly with mask uptake increasing leading to improvements in the situation as well as the PEW's perception polls."

So I put it at about a 95% chance the Democrats keep the House. The senate is much more interesting. In recent years, no party has kept the Senate for more than 4 years, with Republicans keeping it on average for 2.67 terms. Over the past 30 elections, the Senate has only flipped five times, but each of those flips has come in the past 16 cycles, meaning the chance of a flip is around 30% in the modern era. However, there have only been six elections in the past 30 years where a swing of more than four seats in either direction ended up changing the majority party, and large swings have become less frequent in recent years. Moreover, recent polling shows Republicans hold more ""safe"" and ""likely"" seats than Democrats, meaning Dems would have to win around 80% of the toss-up/leaning seats to gain the majority without the VP. However, polling has been trending consistently in favor of the Democrats in recent months, meaning that possibility is not negligible. So I give them a 30% chance of winning the Senate in November."

President Trump has started drawing rebukes from incumbent Republicans seeking to distance themselves from him while loyalists are now confronting the problem of his record on coronavirus and Civil Rights protest response. Trump has attempted to divert attention from his coronavirus failings by focusing on quelling Civil Rights protests. This is increasingly backfiring as people realize Trump's calls for law and order come under his administration's failure to maintain law and order. Consequently, it is unlikely that Republicans will retake the gerrymandered House of Representatives by picking up any marginal districts that were lost in 2018. The possibility of Trump's strategy working is most likely to be found in Republicans retaining Senate seats in ""red states."" The question of how the votes play-out will depend largely on Joe Biden's actions. Thus far, Biden's strategy has been to let Trump be Trump; and this has led to a legitimate lead for Biden in national polls and apparent leads in state polls across ""battleground states"" and even in to Florida, Texas, and Arizona. If Biden can continue to sail the vast middle channel of the political spectrum with non-controversial policies and a non-controversial pick for vice president, Trump will have to generate momentum internally, and this is something that he has thus far been unable to do in 2020. On the other hand, if Biden has a series of gaffes or controversial policy proposals, these may not sink his chances to be president, but they may tilt Senate races against him and preserve the majority for Republicans. Given Biden's discipline thus far, I rate this as a 1-in-3 chance, with some of the likelihood that red seats will remain red (Graham remaining Senator in South Carolina, for example) subsumed."

On the other hand, people are angry and may out-stubborn the suppression to vote anyway, especially with many people turning to mail-in ballots this year. If there is a massive push to mail-in ballots, that could weigh things heavily in the favor of Democrats taking both houses, but I don't know what the numbers are on ballots requested to guess there. I believe there's a decent chance in some places people who experienced voter suppression during the Democratic primary may be turned off from voting a blue ballot, but I suspect that will be more impactful on the Presidential race than the Congressional races, but it factors into the slight lead to the same arrangement as we currently have."

Currently, polls (RealClearPolitics/fivethirtyeight) suggest that 46 Senate seats are safe/lean Democratic. 48 Senate seats are safe/lean Republican. That leaves 6 toss up states. So for Republicans to maintain control of the Senate they need either (i) 2 Senate seats from the 6 toss ups AND the Vice Presidency (Trump re-election), OR (ii) 3 Senate seats from the 6 toss ups (and Trump doesn't have to be re-elected). For Democrats to gain control of the Senate they need either (i) 4 Senate seats from the 6 toss ups AND the Vice Presidency (Biden election), OR (ii) 5 Senate seats from the 6 toss ups (and Biden doesn't have to be elected). Given the pandemic, tanking economy, and Trumps corresponding declines in the polls in key swing states (Fla, NC, Mich, etc) I currently give Joe Biden a 75% chance of taking the White House (historically re-election is tied to how the economy is performing at the time of election, and there's record levels of unemployment). When it comes to the 6 toss-up Senate seats (CO, IA, ME, NC, MI, and MT)...I have 4 of them leaning Democratic (my assigned probabilities, given current polls, are CO-D at 95% probability, ME-D at 62% probability, MI-D at 70% probability, and MT-D at 52% probability), with IA and NC being toss-ups (my assigned probabilities, given current polls at 50%-50%). With those assigned probabilities that gives Democrats about a 63% probability of winning 4 of those 6 toss ups. This 63% plus my assigned 75% probability of a Biden victory (meaning a Democratic VP will break ties in the Senate) should then impel me to increase the probability of Democrats taking control of both House and Senate to about 69%. But I've made this a little bit more conservative given two factors: (i) we're still over 4.5 months away from the election (and in a very volatile political/economic moment), and (ii) the Senate doesn't typically change control that often and even usually has a slight Republican/rural bias. So I brought down this 69% to a 63% probability that Demcrats take the House AND the Senate, with the remaining 37% that Democrats retain the House and Republicans retain the Senate."

Then (with vice-president) they'll need just one win out of three possible in these states: Iowa, Montana, North Carolina. I consider them a toss-up now. Then there's also a slight possibility of a surprise win in e.g. Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Alabama, Texas or Alaska. It seems close.

That said, if th Republicans win control of the house then the Dems would not have carried the senate seats required to flip. So I zeroed that choice. The second choice, dems control house and rep control senate, is status quo and that is very likely given the lack of turnover in seats. The first choice i am pegging at 17 percent since as i said flipping 3 seats let alone 4 senate seats is a big job. The last choice, rep controlling both houses, again is based on the control of the senate is tough to flip, and i am not quite sure how big Trump's coattails will be. The economic hit of covid 19 is not good for Trump and republicans. I believe covid 19 goes away in April and economy recovers, but then in september the conversation will restart for the new flu season and who knows if we start going through the same stock market gyrations and if Trump goes off message. Trump has a lot of time to prepare the message for september and october to avoid catastrophe so I continue to weight option 4 higher than option 1.

Warren Buffett once said, ""I don't look to jump over 7-foot bars: I look around for 1-foot bars that I can step over"". It is not that Democrats cannot win the Senate -I assume they will maintain control of the House-, but that they have to jump over a 7-foot bar to do so and the Republicans have the easier task of jumping over a 1-foot bar. To take control, Democrats need a net gain of 4 seats or 3 seats plus the vice-president's tie-breaking vote. Added to this difficulty, the Senate electoral map does not favour the Democrats: the seats up for grabs already lean-Republican, so a conservative estimate would assume that the Republicans do enough to keep control. It's not a slam dunk: the Republicans are spread wide, defending 23 of the 35 seats on the ballot, so in terms of who has a chance to flip a seat, the Democrats are more likely. Election forecasters Inside Elections, Sabato’s Crystal Ball and The Cook Political Report currently rate Democrats’ opportunities to pick up seats more favorably than Republicans’. Again, Republicans have a margin of error."
