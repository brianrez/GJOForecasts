Additionally, we saw how slow these two sides were to agree on terms during the COVID season of 2020. The last lockout pushed spring training back, I don't think that would be the case this time since both parties agree that it would be devastating to the game. However, I don't believe that this will be solved before January 1."

A strike or lockout would affect the Spring games. Time is on both sides to continue their talks.

Additionally, the COVID response will be a sticking point and there will be an issue with the Toronto/Buffalo Blue Jays. There is also the matter concerning 'sticky stuff' like Spider Tack, affected spin rates, checking for foreign substances, etc. I expect the CBA to be signed and committed by 1 March 2022 in time to start spring training on time but there will be a delay in the CBA."

I'm guessing a 30 % chance of an extension. Strikes are rare and not a good strategy after COVID-19 brought down revenues.
