Could have been convinced to predict a ~20% probability a few weeks back given the pro/cons at the time: (+) optimistic negotiations on a $1.5 trn version, (-) Manchin's office's comments on the climate investments (e.g. threatening ""grid reliability""), (-) Manchin's antagonism of the childcare tax credit which is a hard line for progressives."

Surviving the midterms against historical trends would require the voting rights bills currently being considered to be signed into law. There is a concerted effort to rally the votes around the MLK Jr. holiday for messaging purposes. Therefore, I do not think that the Biden administration is making BBB a priority right now. Additional evidence to support this is that in December, Majority Leader Schumer promised a vote on the BBB Act to pressure Senator Manchin and threaten him with an official vote on his record on which he could be attacked. I have not read anywhere about the planned vote. It is my suspicion that Leader Manchin and President Biden are trying to ease tensions with Senator Manchin so that he would be more likely to go against his previous stance and vote for a filibuster carveout to pass the voting rights bills. Additionally, because of recent reporting and media appearances by folks like Stacey Abrams, the messaging seems to be centered around voting rights and tying that effort to January 6th. Passing both large pieces of legislation in a dual track would be a nearly insurmountable task for the Biden administration, especially considering his low approval rating."

However, this bill is a very high-profile bill with significant presidential backing and emphasis making it more likely to be passed. One drawback, on the other hand, is the tight window given in the question of 13 January especially given the upcoming holiday recess and the fact that the Senate is not likely to resume business until about 6 January or later. If the question time frame were pegged to the end of January, more than likely before the President gives a State of the Union address, I would say the odds would be higher that at least a modified form of HR5376 would be signed into law.

There are several other issues now on the table (debt ceiling). It seems likely that, if pushed, Machin will support it, so it depends whether Schumer feels confident in pushing him. As usual it will probably be an 11th hour decision, so if it happens will likely be late this week. I'll give it 2-1 but am not confident enough to go past that."

Machin and Sinema and are a little bit of a wildcard in the situation, but their voting record has been supportive of Joe Biden. Reconciliation also allows the bill to have unlimited amendments by both Democratic and Republicans, which increases the opportunity to for the bill to pass with dramatic alterations (https://www.crefc.org/cre/content/News/Items/advocacy-items/_House_Passes_BBB_but_Senate_May_Not_Pass_before_Yearend.aspx)"
