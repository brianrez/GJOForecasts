He says that for this, the operation is divided into three fronts. It is planned to enter through Belarus in the north first and head west to Lviv. This region is considered the main route for the shipment of weapons. The second front will be opened through the Black Sea Region and Crimea. Dozens of ships leaving the Novorossiysk Port of Russia are already waiting in the open sea. Donbas, where the third front land clashes still continue. Putin wants to completely break through the defenses of the Ukrainian army and advance to Zaporizhia and Kharkiv. Illarionov likens the 3-way plan to the great battle of Stalingrad. The fact that he put the Russian chief of staff, Valeri Gerasimov, at the head of the troops in Ukraine, is also seen as a part of the operation.
