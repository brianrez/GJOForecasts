Apparently invoking the nuclear option won't be as simple as I assumed; three GOP senators enough to prevent it, and not all moderate GOP senators are high on Gorsuch, have liberal constituencies, Roe v Wade concerns, etc. From Wikipedia (""Nuclear option""): ""In most proposed variations of the nuclear option, the presiding officer would rule that a simple majority vote is sufficient to end debate. If the ruling is challenged, a majority would be required to overturn it. If the ruling is upheld, it becomes a precedent. This would end what had effectively become a 60-vote requirement for confirmation of an executive or judicial nominee, or the passage of legislation.""

In both cases, Gorsuch will be approved, and there is enough time for this to happen by April 30, even if this requires some discussions during the recess.

It seems the Democrats could hold up the process indefinitely, unless the rules are changed. The Republicans stopped Obama's candidate being confirmed for almost a year, do the Democrats want to stop Trump's candidate being confirmed until Trump leaves office? Surely the objective of the system is to get members of the Supreme Court who are acceptable to most people, not for each party to only confirm nominees that agree with their political views. From what is happening now it appears that there is no qualified person in the USA that has cross party support to simply make judgements based on the law. I find it difficult to believe that this was the intention of those who created the system. In theory the Supreme Court could just die out because of a lack of agreement on who to appoint. So my assumption is that at some point someone (probably Gorsuch) will be appointed, but maybe not until after 30th April."

While it still is likely Gorsuch will ultimately be confirmed, the filibuster puts the April 30 date in jeopardy, as Senate R's will have to muster 60 votes to end the filibuster, followed by another 60 to confirm Gorsuch."

On one hand, you could argue that attention drawn toward Russia investigation could make things easier for him. On the other, you could have Dems considering more aggressive options pending outcome of FBI investigation. But given that the actual election tabulations were not corrupted, the GOP sweep will stand, even if there are indictments/resignations from administration. And that would mean Gorsuch still a viable nominee, I think? There would have to be some bombshell leaks or FBI reveals to derail his confirmation. I would bump up to 95% if not for those uncertainties, but still think confirmation by end of next month is very high probability."

Gorsuch's confirmation and the Republican health care bill will reach the Senate at about the same time, which would provide for some interesting dynamics. First, I believe McConnell will give priority to the vote on Gorsuch, as the health care bill would require a lot of time. Second, the Republicans are united in their support for Gorsuch, and some Democrats (Manchin (WV), Heitcamp (ND), King (ME)) have said they would not be against an up or down vote. Third, if a vote on Gorsuch is supported by 55-57 Senators, McConnell will find it easier to push for changing the filibuster rule for SC appointments. Fourth, all this should temper the Democrats' zeal to filibuster Gorsuch, as this could (i) eliminate the filibuster rule and made a (much more contentious) second and even third Trump SC appointment an easy reality, and (ii) break their tenuous ties with moderate Republicans, which will be vital to defeat the health care bill."

With only three Senate working weeks between the end of the hearing and the deadline of this question (Mar 27-Apr 7 and then Apr 24-28), the Democrats can slow the confirmation with procedural moves, no need to resort to filibuster. I am still unclear if they would want to do so, because there will be a political price to pay for Democratic Senators in conservative states. But if they want to slow the process, they can. McConnell can't prevent that without changing a number of Senate rules that allow delays (not the filibuster, other rules) - and I am not sure he would have enough Republican support for that."

Given that Gorsuch is supported by all Senate Republicans, the Democrats may make a strategic decision to let him be approved in order to keep the uneasy coalition with moderate Republican senators. On the other hand, if several Trump-related matters are heading for the Supreme Court, it may make sense to try and delay Gorsuch's vote for as long as possible. Under this scenario, McConnell may not have the votes to remove the filibuster as an opposition technique. So the confirmation may slip beyond April 30. This is a long shot, though - or is it?

Democrats are calculating where to spend the political capital resulting from the President's various activities in the first several weeks of his term. Given these various priorities, opposing a well-defined if conservative justice is likely to exhaust political capital required for fights on issues of more immediacy, i.e. Bannon's increasingly expansive role in National Security. Additionally, pushing this fight to the extreme is likely to evoke the ""nuclear option"" on the part of Senate Republicans, and so is likely to be ineffective. The symbolic impact of that use will be lessened by how eminently qualified Judge Gorsuch is. Therefore I believe it is increasingly unlikely that Democrats will use their restricted menu of options to prevent this nomination going through. Meanwhile the Presidential Administration has signaled that it is interested in establishing itself quickly, and is likely to push for a quick confirmation."

Since the deadline is in 87 days, the base rate of success is about 75%. However, based on Republicans' refusal to allow Garland in will cause Democrats to fight the nominee. They may even filibuster, but that is a risk, especially in a Republican-controlled House and Senate, which could easily change the rules to be a simple majority is needed to confirm a Supreme Court candidate. Neither side wants that to happen. Past the descent among Democrats, Neil Gorsuch is a good candidate. He is a decorated judge who shares his views greatly with the late Scalia, returning the SCOTUS back to pre-Scalia's death. Because of all this, I put him at 3 points higher than the base rate.

He may not appreciate how qualitatively different a Supreme Court Nominee is from a cabinet position, and attempt to nominate someone deeply ill-suited for the role, but fitting the mold of a viable candidate in his mind. This could lead to a situation not unlike Pres. George W. Bush's failed nomination of Harriet Miers, resulting in a ""no"" resolution for this question. Moreover, the predictions on GJO with any indication of research effort are converging at lower estimates than my former estimates. This reflects uncertainty about Trump's nominee.

When the announcement is made, I expect to have a fairly strong update based on the nominee's qualification."

If we treat the inauguration as a sort of ""reset"" button on filling the seat, we should expect it to be filled within 100 days with about 2/3 confidence. That said, Supreme Court nominees are especially contentious (as we've recently learned), and the Democrats may engage in a Tit-for-Tat strategy of denying Trump's nominee purely in a punitive response to the Republicans' failure to advise and consent on Merrick Garland.
