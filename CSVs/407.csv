However, he also noted that “…they will abate, and as they do, inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer-run 2% goal.” This supports our core assessment of no change in the target funds rate by the December FOMC meeting. However, the disclosure that “as reopening continues, bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could again prove to be greater and more enduring than anticipated, posing upside risks to inflation” serves to validate our asymmetrical risk view that assigns a higher probability to a rate hike than to a rate cut. We therefore make no changes to our conditional probability ratings:"
