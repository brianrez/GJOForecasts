The Republican Party seems unable to achieve internal consensus let alone demonstrate readiness to govern. The price will be loss of majority status in the Senate.

Considering that Clinton is currently the favorite against Trump (which would break the tie in favor of the Dems), I have the democrats as favorites to retake the senate. The republicans still have a decent chance to maintain control if a) Trump is denied the nomination, b) the GOP establishment runs a third party candidate for president, or c) the GOP is able to successfully distance themselves from Trump. Also, their status as incumbents should net them a few percentage points at the polls leaving them with a reasonable chance of maintaining control of the senate."

However, one can attempt a generic prediction along the following lines. 1. 34 Senate seats will be contested, 24 of them Republican. 2. These seats were last contested in 2010, a great year for the Republicans who used the newly introduced ""Obamacare"" to good effect. 3. 2010 was a mid-term year whereas this time turnout turnout is expected to be higher and this usually helps the Democrats. Also, I don't see any issue as emotive as Obamacare this time,. 4. It looks like the economy will continue to grow, though probably at a slower rate, and though there is a possibility of foreign policy setbacks (Iran, Syria etc) it is more likely there won't be. 5.Contrasted to the Republican candidates, the Democrats appear in much better shape, and Obama's own popularity graph seems to be rising above his earlier lows. 6. If the Republicans lose 5 seats out of their 24, they'll end up with 49 and without a majority. With the conditions listed above helping the Democrats, a loss of 5 seats seems more likely than not. 7. Getting into specifics, how many of the Republican seats are in states that Obama carried in 2012? Florida, Wisconsin, Illinois, New Hampshire, Ohio and Pennsylvania - of course some of the incumbents will be popular enough to overcome the trend, but I think that's enough to sway my initial forecast towards the Democrats. 8. If Trump is the Republican candidate, the swing away from his party may be greater. There are still about eight months left, plenty of time to adjust in either direction."
