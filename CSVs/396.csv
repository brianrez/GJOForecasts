After that he can decide to overturn the moratorium himself or refer it the full court. Again, this is not going to be oral arguments. I am not even sure Robergs will refer this to the whole court. If he refers it to the whole court and it is overturned along ideology lines then that feeds fuel to the ""Scotus is unfair to liberals crowd"". If he does it himself then he takes the heat, but he has tenure. Although if he refers it to the whole court, nothing gharantees Kavanaufhs vote. Kavanaugh may once again deteremine that a few more weeks to orderly disburse the rental relief funds will not harm the landlords."

Justice Roberts has asked for the government's response by Monday, August 23rd. This is moving faster than I expected. However, as I am far from a legal expert, I am only going to increase my probability to 87%. The merits of the case will decide the outcome at this point. Given previous public comments, it does not seem favorable the moratorium will remain in its current format. Even President Biden has acknowledged that success in the courts will be limited."

However, there is a small chance he will allow the moratorium due to it's reduced scope and limited time frame."

For now, it appears that the CDC's moratorium has legal effect. But on a technicality; https://reut.rs/37GbIsX. It appears that an Appeals court hearing must be heard and then the appellants can approach the Supreme court for a definitive ruling on the legality of the moratorium."

So I think what happens is 5th circuit will uphold the ban, then the appellate circuit will uphold ban also citing prior case outcome. Then it gets referred to SCOTUS with request to Block the ban. SCOTUS will Block the ban and send the case back to trial to develop a record, thus avoiding issuance of a binding opinion. By the time the trial concludes and appeals are concluded it will be 2023 and hopefully moot!"
