The stalling of peace efforts between the different parties in the Yemeni civil war and the scaling back of famine relief efforts by the UN due to a lack of funding and the COVID-19 pandemic together mean that the situation in Yemen is unlikely to improve and will most likely get worse. High propensity for a famine to exist and the lack of UN funding increases the likelihood that the UN will use a famine declaration as a rallying cry to galvanize support for relief efforts.
