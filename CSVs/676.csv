How far is 2008 / 2009 comparable - since this was a pure real estate crisis / financial crisis in the first place and not an pandemic? I believe a comparison is helpful but only in some respects: 2008 / 09 were mainly consumers in the residential sector - so commercial real estate was less hit nevertheless the rates jumped above 8.6 at the peak. So theoretically it should be possible that this time since office, retail, hotel and restaurants are even more severlly hit that we see similar new height. On the other hand this time politicians and the FED acted even quicker and more generous but how much this will help real businesses is the crucial question. I strongly believe that rates will pass 4.00 % easily but more in the form of a backlog or as Jeremy Grantham said a slow motion train wreck that slowly but surely shows its effect. Liquidity crunch and everything that hinges indirectly on it like delinquincy rates are like a train crash . So my assesment weighing all the counteracting forces is, that we will see similar peaks but the time horizont in this question is too short to show the real effects until it works itself fully through the system, Next update in around 2 - 3 weeks when Fred data for Q1 are released and since in 2008 / 09 these effects are slow but sure adjustment in one direction or the other are made."

Industrial might increase if manufacturing starts shifting, but no idea how much that would change and when. https://connectedremag.com/newsletter/cre-mortgage-delinquencies-are-on-the-rise/ “Property prices have risen, but that is largely due to supportive Federal Reserve QE mortgage purchasing and the substantial rate cut earlier this year. Put simply, the surge in property prices should not be taken as a sign that commercial property sales volumes are likely to recover anytime soon. In fact, this situation implies commercial property sales may actually decline next year, particularly if long-term interest rates continue to bounce.” This raises a good point about long-term interest rates, especially with the Fed stating they will allow the economy to run ""hot"" for a while to counteract periods of low inflation. CRE prices may decline between that and the structural move towards WFH and online shopping, which will have some effect on delinquencies."

A similar rate of increase would result in a range of 1.25-1.31%. The max increase in 1 qtr was during the 2008 financial crisis, +1.26, resulting in a ceiling of 2.42. The difference between now and 2008 is the uneven nature of the distress right now. This is NOT a liquidity crisis. Lodging is hurting badly, retail and office less so. But other types of commercial real estate, such as warehousing and industrial, are not hurting at all. Additionally, there's so much extra capital/liquidity floating around right now that investors are anxious to either purchase properties outright from delinquent owners, or to refinance or otherwise shore up/profit from the distressed owners. Furthermore, banks (themselves flush with liquidity) are also willing to negotiate with mortgagees, knowing that some sort of payment is better than no payment (witness last year's Mall of America massive renegotiation). All of this collectively is keeping loan delinquencies low. The excess liquidity and lopsided real estate ""pain"" make this a very unusual ""recession."" All of these factors lead me to believe that even with the ""main street"" economy worsening, this rate is highly likely to stay below 2% this quarter.

[1] It may be worth noting here that in the Great Recession, CMBS delinquencies tracked roughly about 450 bps higher than commercial loans. With CMBS nearing 10% in 2Q2020, if the same relationship were to follow here, that would support, in my estimation, weighting bins 3-5 heavily, with the fattest part of the curve in bin 4 or 5."
