Given the UAE have won 75% of recent meetings and are on better form, it is likely they will advance to the Quarters. Then at Quarters, they will likely face Iraq who will likely win their group. Iraq has historically been more successful 56% of the time, which is reflected by the most likely outcome being the UAE losing the Quarters. If they win their quarters, the chances of them beating their likely opponent Egypt falls by half statistically to then reach the finals."
