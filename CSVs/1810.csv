It's highly unlikely Trump and co want a Putin pow-wow right now with all the heat coming at him from Mueller, in addition to the apparent friction between T&P, as fellow forecaster SteveHammons stated with links in his comment earlier today. Also, in the wake of hurricane hell and various catastrophic aftermaths unfolding, even a hands-off president might be faced with some unexpected blocks in his calendar. Lastly, North Korea...While our cheeks are collectively clenched over NK's growing nuke fetish (specifically missiles over Japan and this very recent hydrogen bomb test) and Trump's less-than-diplomatic toilet tweets, a global oil embargo and sanctions are being called for by the US and allies against NK. Putin ain't playing this - black gold will continue to flow from RUS to NK, which conceivably adds ample contention on its own to delay bilateral visits at this time. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/world/asia/north-korea-putin-oil-embargo.html"

But, the effect of POTUS signing the new Russian sanctions bill may in fact spur discussion over how to better handle the relationship between the two countries. I admit, that consequence seems unlikely to manifest, particularly with the Trump-Russia issues that permeate every facet of U.S. politics these days. That being considered, Trump has an incentive - maintaining a semblance of credibility and deniability in the face of U.S. media - to avoid direct interaction with Russia at all costs if it has any potential to be construed as favoring Russia. On the other hand, Putin would seem to have a small incentive to engage with the U.S. given both these new sanctions and the Pentagon's recent indication that it was prepared to get involved in Ukraine in some capacity. Add in Russia's planned military exercises on NATO boarders, and you have a situation that is ripe for disaster and also prime for discussion. Thus, although Trump would lose political capital by reaching out, Putin would not and would stand to gain in the eyes of the international community bu reaching out before any military action (exercises or otherwise) came to bear. For these reasons, I believe there is a slight, but unlikely, chance that a bilateral visit could occur."

The Kremlin reported it just fine, so they don't mind a meeting. So both sides want to meet, but there's more restraint from Trump's side as they consider the political issues of being seen to be too close to Putin. I think I've read official state visits take a while to organise, but it would also depend on the results of hearings/inquiries into Russia and how critical those hearings are of Russian involvement, which would mean further Russian contact not being a good thing. Trump might also just suddenly invite Putin at the G20, but that would depend on how they get along, which is slightly hard to tell right now; various issues could erupt between now and then."

In December they included Norway and Denmark, both countries of lesser strategic importance to the US. Given that Trump has expressed doubts about the future of the EU, he would want to strengthen relationships with UK on the East and Russia on the West at an early stage. Post May's visit, Russia is very likely to be on the calendar. With the US out of the TPP, the path is clear to negotiate with Russia.

In General, I think with recent news on hacking the election etc, Trump won't show to much closeness with Putin during first months in office. My reasoning: Path A: Sunday Times is right (70%) - A1: They'll still host each other (20%) - A2: The meeting in Iceland will be the only one till Oct 1st (80%) Path B: Sunday Times is wrong (30 %) - B1: They will meet in US or RU (35 %) - B2: They will meet somewhere else (40 %) - B3: They won't meet at all (25 %) So prob for question is 0.7*0.2+0.3*0.35 = 0,245 = 25 %"

People cite a single report by the Sunday times that was later refuted, even though the supposed trip does not even meet the question criteria. Others cite completely irrelevant facts such as their personal dislike of Putin or Trump, or even their fear that liberalism is dying."

Nothing gets accomplished, etc. I can't rule this out, let's give it a 10% chance.” Given the characters in question, however, I think this scenario deserves a much higher than 10% chance, probably even in the 80 to 90% range. Especially if the presence of Russia at the G8 conference continues to be disallowed, then I think Trump could not resist the opportunity to stand out by going against the flow. So my first-ever contribution to the good judgment project is based on the effects of anchoring and salience – hardly an auspicious beginning!"

Looking at the Office of the US Historian website state visits are relatively rare in either direction. There hasn't been a state visit to the US by a Russian president since Yeltsin and the above website indicates there have only been a small number of state visits to Russia by US presidents. The Trump - Putin ""relationship"" does add an extra dimension/unknown which has pushed me from 5% to 10% but I still think an official state visit is unlikely in the first 9 months of the Trump presidency."
