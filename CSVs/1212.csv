"Between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2019, will an armed group from the Philippines engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in the Philippines?",2018-12-28T18:00:00Z,2019-03-31T06:59:00Z,Yes,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],99,654,54,237,"The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (Early Warning Project). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 31 March 2019 and will be resolved in January 2020 after EWP assesses the situation in the Philippines from January 2019 to December 2019. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilian fatalities occur in one or more campaigns. See The Early Warning Project for examples. See GJ‚Äôs FAQ on forecasting questions like this. Confused?

If the summary executions of drug users and dealers continues, then I assess a 75% chance of an armed group from the Philippines will engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians. Moreover, although the battle of Marawi City in Mindanao is over, ISIS-P and the loyal Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) maintain a presence in the region as evidenced by the 27 January 2019 double bombing of Cathedrals in city of Jolo killing 20 civilians2 . Additionally, on 1 August 2018, a suicide bomber linked to ASG killed 11 civilians in Basilan using a vehicle borne improvised explosive device at a military check point3 . While, the bombings consist of 31 casualties within a 6 month time frame and also, represent the two largest attacks during that period, the bombings were perpetrated by one group. Terrorism in Mindanao extends to additional groups such as (the largest): the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), and the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines, New People‚Äôs Army (NPA). These groups all operate in and out of the Mindanao region, and all largely use improvised explosive devices as their primary tactic to engage in terrorism. I judge, the death tolls of terrorism and the ‚Äúwar on drugs‚Äù is highly likely to reach 1,000 or more within the given time frame."
