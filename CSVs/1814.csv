I am still not sure it meets the criteria of a renegotiated peace agreement, inasmuch as it only shifts a small amount of money the government was going to take to a fund for victims. That is the same deal they had before only the government agreed to allow the government to release some of the funds it would received to the people. The government of Colombia renegotiate a condition which the government already held, which cold have been accomplished outside of the peace agreement. Still the end condition will have been accomplished if the opposition accepts the governments concessions, yet ratification exits not a condition. However there seems to exits a possibility of a rejection by the opposition, which would lead to more negotiations on the more than 50 points of interest they hold. Although, the opposition was expecting concession from FARC during the renegotiate a peace agreement ."
