Will there be a new episode of mass killing in Afghanistan before 1 January 2017?,2016-08-09T17:00:55Z,2016-12-31T18:00:15Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],591,654,169,237,"For more information on what constitutes an episode of mass killing, see the Early Warning Project's Definitions page. According to those criteria, Afghanistan is already experiencing an episode of mass killing perpetrated by the Taliban (Early Warning Project). This question pertains to the risk of a new episode of mass killing. The Early Warning Project’s statistical risk assessments identified Afghanistan as the 8th country at the greatest risk of an onset of a new episode of state-led mass killing. Those forecasts do not include the risk of mass killing by non-state groups, which would also produce a “yes” answer to this question. This question will be resolved by the Early Warning Project, in consultation with subject matter experts, using publicly available secondary sources. If the project determines that a new episode of mass killing has occurred, relevant evidence will be summarized in a post on EWP's blog. Recommended Questions Will there be a new episode of mass killing in Yemen before 1 January 2017? Will there be a new episode of mass killing in Pakistan before 1 January 2017? Will the government of Afghanistan and the Afghan Taliban participate in official talks before 1 March 2017? This question was closed as a ""no"" with an end date of 31 December 2016. The EWP did not find evidence of a new mass killing episode in Afghanistan before the end of 2016 (Early Warning Project).

In June, the Obama administration granted expanded authorities for airstrikes in Afghanistan, allowing U.S. forces to target the Taliban to provide “strategic effects” on the battlefield. In reality, the effects have done just enough to keep the Taliban from holding key territory — such as a district center — for an extended amount of time. Before the summer decision, U.S. air power had been relegated to going after terrorist targets and supporting the defense of U.S. Special Operations forces throughout the country.""

(this is up 47% compared to the same period last year. 640 for the same time period this coming half of the year would be 640+640=1280, which gives this answer a YES. Taliban seem to carry out the majority of the attacks, due to their much greater control of territory, and numbers. I will attribute a conservative 50% of total deaths to Taliban, and 10% of total deaths to IS. Thus IS would be responsible for 160 deaths for that portion of the year. It seems unlikely this will reach 1000 before the years end. It’s possible that the numbers of civilians killed by both sides will increase, but as the pro-government forces have already increased much more this year (47%), I doubt they will increase substantially more, in the coming 4 months. Possibly to a 50% increase on last year (Jul – Dec 2015). As such, I will say that 650 people between July and end of Dec will be killed by pro-government forces. That brings the total this year by pro-government forces to 1300, exceeding the mass killing definition. So my answer is Yes, It is likely to occur. But how likely? Over 50%, anyway. We have seen since July, that the US are not removing as many US soldiers from Afghanistan as previously planned, due to rising violence and tensions in Afghanistan. Also, IS and Taliban have formed a shaky peace pact to combat the US and pro-government afghan soldiers… it’s possible that there will be even higher ground fighting – which is what is contributing most to civilian casualties at the moment. That being said, it could also cause a more directed attack against the pro-government forces – or not. Perhaps more co-ordinated suicide attacks."

Unfortunately the odds have grown since the competing anti government groups appear to be willing to stop fighting each other so as to concentrate on knocking out the government. Thier differences can be settled later. The American and Europeans appear to be do a slow walk out of the picture. Their talk of support may continue but the reality is the Afgan government will be on its own to find a peace or take what money they can and fine a safe haven out of the country. Syria, Iraq and Libya will get what ever attention is offered and Afghanistan will come out on the short end of the stick."

I recently wrote a short paper on Afghanistan and am in regular contact with the German Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Kabul. The situation has gotten worse every month during the past 1-2 years, especially since the Afghanistan version of the Islamic State became active in late 2015. That being said, my risk asessment for a new episode of mass killings is very low. I would like to link to some articles I used in our monitor, but it's down right now. ;-) So I'll link them later."
28163,2016-08-10T13:30:16Z,3,[45.0],[-47.0],"With a new interpretation of 'mass-killing' i reduce my projection to below 50%. Either a new target needs to be undertaken by the taliban or a different organization needs to target a civilian group. Something I find hard to pin down is how broad are the 'groups'? Can there be overlap between 'groups' e.g. could one civilian death be counted in multiple targeted groups? With how things stand, the anti-govt forces are attributed with 60% of civilian deaths (~960), if there is currently an ongoing mass killing, then the number of killings that could be attributed to a NEW mass killing goes down. By how much? Depends on overlap between groups... shot in the dark - 50% (480 left to count towards new). Projecting that to the end of year gives 960, which is not a new mass killing, but this does not account for possibilties of state-led mass killing, a risk, but less likely than one by Taliban (how much? idk). The UN report also noted a decrease in 'targeted and deliberate' killings. This combined with the overarching theme of fewer global mass-killings in recent history pushes me below 50%. I would go lower if not for the high uncertainty in the region."
