Even the worst part of the pandemic's confusion (the fiscal year prior 2020-2021), saw EK bottoming out -66%. That's not so horrific all things considered (*cough cough* Cathay Pacific!). However to reach revenues of AED 69KM by end of March '22, we'd need to see an increase of around AED 40KM or more than double the '20-'21 performance. Was Expo that much of an int'l draw? آسف I doubt Prince William's flights were on EK and if it was, his seat would an expense to the airline rather than revenue. But chin up; travel into the UAE will see a decent recovery as soon as Pres. Xi feels ready to loosen China's covid restrictions. And of course I totally know what I'm talking about..."

How about a state subsidy? Why is the crowd so high on this question? Does someone know something I don't?) , so I'm shifting to a more uncertain position. I would probably go up even a little further except that @sebawi and @jleibowich are both in what I believe should be the ""correct"" range and I suspect they've done their homework.

In order to reach the AED 68.9bn target, they would need to grow revenue by over 115% in H2. Unfortunately, international travel has continued to stagnate in the latter part of 2021. A recent report by the UN's ICAO (prepared December 2021) presented five different forecasts for total international passenger volumes in each month of 2022 (page 39 below). Across those five scenarios, total international passenger volume between October 2021 and March 2022 (which corresponds to Emirates H2) was between 35% and 50% larger than total internal passenger volume between April 2021 and September 2021 (which corresponds to Emirates H1). 35-50% passenger growth is well below the 115%+ growth Emirates needs to reach the AED 68.9bn target. Consequently, there's little chance of this happening."
