"In Trump v. Hawaii, will the Supreme Court rule on whether the September 2017 Presidential Proclamation on immigration violates or likely violates the Establishment Clause of the Constitution?",2018-04-04T17:00:02Z,2018-06-26T17:00:33Z,"Yes, and will rule that it does not","['Yes, and will rule that it does', 'Yes, and will rule that it does not', 'No']",['US Policy'],188,654,94,237,"In September 2017, President Trump issued a Proclamation that put substantial limitations on the entry of citizens from six Muslim-majority countries (The White House). A District Court granted a preliminary injunction preventing enforcement of a large part of the Proclamation, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, for the most part, the District Court's injunction (SCOTUS Blog). President Trump appealed (SCOTUS Blog). ""Likely violates"" refers to a situation in which the Court makes a decision on the Establishment Clause for the purposes of ruling on the preliminary injunction, but does not make a direct ruling on the proclamation. The Supreme Court is expected to hand down its decision in its current term, but if it does not, the question will resolve as No. See our FAQ to learn about how we resolve questions and how scores are calculated.",https://www.gjopen.com/questions/925-in-trump-v-hawaii-will-the-supreme-court-rule-on-whether-the-september-2017-presidential-proclamation-on-immigration-violates-or-likely-violates-the-establishment-clause-of-the-constitution

If it were simply a question of will SCOTUS support Trump's travel ban or not, it would have been much easier. But this question asks just one thing. Will SCOTUS rule that the travel ban violates the Establishment Clause or not. Initially, I forecast 90% No-- figuring the Court would find one or more aspects of the statutory questions to base its decision and as minimalists, would avoid the Establishment Clause issue. I am not an attorney but researched all four of the questions and came to the conclusion that whether SCOTUS agrees or not with Trump's ban, they would rule on the statutory aspects of it. I figured that by version 3 of the travel ban, they got it right (legally)."

To the point of this question, Justice Alito raised the point that by reading the text of the proclamation alone, one cannot infer that this has anything to do with Muslims. Other Justices, with exception from Justice Sotomayor, did not ask any question to counter Justice Alito. Therefore, I would put the chance for No to 80%.
