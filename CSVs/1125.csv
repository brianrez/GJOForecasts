And there has been a limited spread from the outbreak in neighboring Samoa, with nine cases reported in American Samoa in this latest outbreak. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-08/measles-outbreak-declared-in-samoas-neighbour-american-samoa/11778014 Nonetheless, there's clearly been a aggressive response on both islands, and given the high vaccination rate in the American territory, I have the sense that the spread is being contained. So the nine cases isn't likely to reach the threshold of 224 that would put the overall count for the US over 1,500 for the year. Clearly that's not assured, and my understanding of epidemiology is poor, so I'm going to leave a 1/20 chance at this point that the 1,500 mark will be reached this month."

First, measles requires tropical / warm weather to spread and so late Q3 and early Q4 are seasonally the weakest. We can observe this in WHO data (which gives us seasonality by month for a few countries going back many years) - this isn't perfect because some of these countries are in different hemisphere but hopefully it is good enough. Also, 2014 (past peak measles) going into 2015 we saw a 75% drop in cases (simply because of reversion to the mean), so we should expect a slowdown in cases for that reason too. Finally, we are already seeing a slowdown in cases per month because case / month has dropped by about 25 since June. We also get Sep to date data from WHO so you can guess what rest of september will be for purposes of analysis. What worries me is that the rate of slow-down was lower in September (e.g., CDC partial-month number in Sep implies 30 for Sep vs. 24 in Aug), which causes me to expand my bounds upward a bit."

There've been about 3130 cases of measles in the past 10 years, averaging about 313 cases, although with 2019 being far higher than any other case combined, even beating out the 2014 outbreak, I'd skew that average higher in more recent years (with the last 5 years as consideration it raises to 388), the spread of anti-vaxxers may be the cause of this surging outbreak, causing it to spread far more, but seeing as the rate of increase of them has mellowed out over the years, it's fair to say that the spread of measles likely won't increase at an exponential rate. We can assume a bit of a more drop off of measles cases in the US based on the factors that in may, there were about 971 cases, and now in August it's only 1,170 or so, implying that there's been a major decrease of the spread, possibly due to reaching more vaccinated peoples who aren't affected by it. Judging by this, it seems unlikely at the moment, that with such a decreasing pool of cases, that it'd surpass the 1500 mark for cases."

I then used the current US cases for the year (1148 as of yesterday) and ran 250 Monte Carlo deviates from the above empiric distribution (ie, 1148/rand-dist).

Now, almost halfway through what is on track to be the nation’s worst year for measles outbreaks since 1992, their study is looking rather prescient. Of the counties named in the paper, published in May, 14 have had cases of measles. At least 12 counties on the list are adjacent to counties that have ended up with measles cases this year. This includes two of the counties in the largest ongoing outbreak: Nearly 500 confirmed cases in Queens and Kings counties, New York. https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-can-predict-where-measles-will-happen-why-dont-we/"

Figure for the week to June 6 was 41. Extrapolating this value then the figure for June would be around 175. From this it looks like the rate of infection is decreasing substantially. Looking at more detail where the outbreaks are, the CDC indicate that ongoing outbreaks (defined as at least 3 people affected) are happening in New York State (2 places), California (3 places), Pennsylvania and Washington state. Looking at figures for these states (from the CDC link to the state health authorities) it seems that the main outbreak in Washington is over, but in May six people were affected in a different part of Washington state which could signify a new outbreak starting. How bad this will be will depend upon how well the outbreak can be contained and whether it hits a large community of unvaccinated people like the New York outbreaks did. I couldn't find much info for Penn state, but New York City's data shows that the rate of infection is tailing off (Jan 34, Feb 69, Mar 160, Apr 177, May 86). New York has had a very aggressive containment policy including mandatory vaccination and this seems to be curtailing spread of the disease and will probably continue to do so, especially if people in neighbouring areas who are unvaccinated decide that the risk is high and they should get vaccinated. The outbreaks in California were much smaller (Jan 4, Feb 2, Mar 14, Apr 21, May 7) but still show the same type of distribution as the NYC and the overall figures, namely that the rate of infection increased significantly in March, increased yet further in April and then decreased noticeably in May. It seems to me that there will most likely be fewer cases in June than in May, and this downward trend may well continue. I heard that spring is the peak time for measles, at least in Europe, and think that it would be similar for the US but haven't fact checked this. If this is the case, then we would expect the number of new cases to tail off significantly over the summer and into early autumn. Having said that, there are usually more people travelling in the summer who could potentially catch measles abroad and bring it back to the US, and the CDC indicated that most of the outbreaks started with people bringing measles into the US from trips abroad. From the data on the 2014 outbreak in the US (thanks cafebedouin for providing the link to the weekly tables) it seems that the number of new cases tails off very rapidly once the infection is past its peak. Assuming that (i) there is no new large NYC style outbreak in an unvaccinated community, and (ii) measles is more prevalent in the spring, then I would expect the total number to be below 1500 by the end of the year."
