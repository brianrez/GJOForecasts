I have to respect the markets thinking a .75 increase is going to happen though, which is certainly possible given we've increased from increased of .25 to .5 this year. What would be interesting is what would happen after a .75 - the natural thing would be another .75, but that would put it at 3.75, which is higher than the current US rate (though might not be after the next meetings. Another path would be a drop to a .5 increase (or lower), which would send a signal that the curbing is nearing an end, but I think BoE is hesitant to send that signal until inflation actually cools off. I guess we'll learn a lot more when we nee what the US Fed does on Nov 1, if they keep going up quickly, BOE might follow."

More than this and they could do more harm than good, pushing household costs over the brink for many via variable mortgage rates.
