There were over 2,000 cases on August 1st (yesterday). If levels were considered too risky back then, it is likely that the election day will again be pushed back, probably by several months given the current trends in Bolivia. That, when combined with the possibility of a second wave still in the air, means it is becoming less and less likely the election will be held in 2020, especially since it is seen as a ""special election"", meaning there isn't much precedent for when you can and cannot push it back. With Anez so far down in polls, this becomes even more likely, even if not for corrupt reasons, just for the public good. She gains nothing from holding the elections this year during the pandemic, so as we approach the new election date, I suspect another postponement. The rest simply reflects current polling."

The scheduled election in Oct is dependent on the curve of the pandemic. As of this moment, the chances are that election will not be postponed third time. Second issue is whether Arce has any chances of being disqualified. It depends on the court ruling, however, the allegation of electoral violation over a statement may not be strong enough. Hence, in the event, if Arce is not disqualified, he has the backing of the voters with highest rating among the presidential candidates. Hence, the forecast depends on the pandemic and court ruling, which will become clearer in the following weeks."

That said, the crowd seemed pretty spot on with the information available to us. Áñez and ""Someone Else"" seemingly have no chance (read: *legitimate* chance,) but oh well, benefit of the doubt here. As far as what will happen with C19, I think it is safe to expect an election will be held considering the current local trajectory. If anything, perhaps turnout will take the biggest hit. Or maybe it'll drive turnout. If the health ministry says the risk is too high, I believe the election can be postponed until Jan 2021."
