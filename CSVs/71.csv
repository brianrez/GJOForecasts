Apple needs about $250 billion more, but right now, I don't see to know of any key products that are in the works. Plus, they had a key security vulnerability this week. But if Apple launches a new product that's flashy, it could bump them up. Also, if they hire some good talent, it could happen as well."

Rising interest rates will likely be a drag on market cap growth due to their effect on the value of future earnings and the risk of a recession. Hard to see the trigger for 10% increase in market cap in the time available. Would take Apple into the peak territory it was in when markets were ridiculously overvalued, before inflation and interests rates became a concern. Only sensational earnings results or a market rattling product/acquisition announcement might do the trick."
