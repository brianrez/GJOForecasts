Hawley supports “Right to Work” laws and opposed Proposition A; McCaskill opposes “Right to Work” and endorsed Proposition A. Hawley does not support the minimum wage initiative.

It does decrease, but his job disapproval rating surprisingly has decreased to 52%. - In April poll, Trump has job approval of 55% in MO, so it may be risky for McCaskill to play anti-Trump card - Her main challenger Hawley is relatively unknown, but scandal around the R-Governor may boost his name recognition. The scandal didn't tank Hawley despite great effort by McCaskill to tie Hawley with the disgraced governor. Early August Primary may boost even more Hawley's name recognition. - Once Hawley clears the Primary hurdle, more money will pour into his campaign since McCaskill is considered the most vulnerable among tossup races. If McCaskill remains in the Senate, the Democrats would likely flip the Senate by more than 4 seats. But if Blue Wave fizzles, McCaskill would be the first peg to fall."
