But the cumulative odds equation is too difficult and time consuming for me to attempt currently and I am using a bias and ""guessing"" that it is not much more than a flip of a coin if you compound all of the probabilities and then weight subjectively for current power rankings and the number of variables that can change are just too many even in this short window of time (for instance Tom Brady could get injured or Cam Newton that would vastly affect the probabilistic outcomes). I also don't aggregate to 100% because while it is clearly less than 1% chance there is still the remotest of possibilities that the Super Bowl is not played due to a black swan event and even though the probability of such an event of such magnitude happening is probabily less than even 1/10th of a percent, I did want to give voice to the likelihood of neither winning is >0."
