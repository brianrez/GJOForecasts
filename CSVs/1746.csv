The rate was already considered overextended by a number of observers, so rebound seems unlikely. This is particularly true since repatriation of EUR currency held by US firms is likely to continue to take place as firms repatriate funds to take advantage of the new tax laws. At the same time, extensive losses seem unlikely; barring a massive external event, there's no reason to expect a major drop that would be needed to take the rate below 1.10. However, the downward trend has been slow and shows some volatility, and the cutoff figure of 1.20 is right in the middle of what I'd consider to be the most likely endpoint - somewhere between 1.18 and 1.21."

A value of between 1.10-1.20 may be indicative of the recent past, but Trump's 2018 tax plan is revving up the US economy, absent any improvement in savings, and unemployment is approaching an effective rate of zero, which suggests that inflation may be about to return, along with the attendant increase in the budget deficit which will drive interest rates up. Repatriation of profits to the US, including Apple's $250 billion alone, could also serve to help overstimulate the economy."

With a long term range then of maybe 1.25 to 1.45, 1.17 was intended as shocking number, and ""aidez"" was indeed required, and a few years later, has broadly succeeded. Europe now has a better opportunity to catch up to its trend growth line / cyclical recovery, and Macron has to be a more exciting value play than Trump, just because the scope of his reforms are considerably smaller to exceed expectations and improve trend growth. Which leaves central bank policy, and the intriguing question of who figures out how to unwind asset purchases first, the Fed or ECB? The possibility is certainly there of hawkish ECB members pushing for the Dali-esque experimentation of QE to begin to reverse while the Fed dithers. And then we are back to a 1.25-1.45 range, not .9 to 1.2."

Forecast: Between $0.90 and $1: 20%, between $1 and $1.10: 75%, between $1.10 and $1.20: 5%, by Ruben van den Akker on the 11th of April 2017 The information shown in figure 1 is the exchange rate of the euro against the US dollar since the implementation of the euro, indicating how much one needs to pay in dollars to get one euro. It becomes clear from the graph that from 2001 to 2009, the euro was getting stronger relative to the dollar, however, since then the dollar has gradually increased in value compared to the euro. Where €1 was $1.60 in 2008, the current exchange rate is €1 for $1.058. One indicator for the exchange rate of either the dollar or the euro is the interest rate. Governments of every country give out bonds to finance their expenses, in return the buyers get a certain yield. If the interest rate is high, the bond yields are also high and therefore more attractive. Figure 3 shows the yield of a bond with a maturity of 10 years of the United States and figure for shows the same for Germany. As one can see, the yield on US treasury bonds is much higher than the yield on German bonds and therefore buyers are more inclined to purchase the former. Germany is used as an example here because it is the biggest economy in the EU and bonds are issued by governments and not by the European Union. In for example Greece the yield on bonds is much higher, yet this brings a higher risk for the buyer as well. When investors from outside the US buy US treasury bonds, they exchange the currency of their country for US dollars. In other words, they sell their currency and buy dollars. As a result, if the yield on treasury bonds of the US is higher than those o f Germany and other EU countries, then the demand for the US Dollar will increase relative to the demand for euros, which will lead to a lower value of the euro against US dollars. Another strong indicator for developments in the exchange rate is trade. When a country exports a good, the demand for their currency will rise, whilst when importing a good the supply of their currency will rise. Keeping all other factors constant the former situation will lead to an appreciation of the dollar and the latter to a depreciation. In figure 5 the trade balance of the United States is shown, it becomes clear that there is an apparent trade deficit. President of the United States Donald Trump has indicated on many occasions that he finds this unacceptable and he has devised a plan to improve the trade balance. If this plan works out, there will be more export of US goods relative to import of goods to the US, resulting in an appreciation of the dollar. However, there is much uncertainty about whether Trump will succeed in decreasing the trade deficit. In Europe (figure 6) the general trend since 2010 seems to be a positive and improving trade balance over the past couple of years, yet at the moment there is a substantial down fall. If the trend continues then this will lead to an appreciation of the euro in the coming years, keeping all other factors constant. In conclusion, there is much uncertainty about what the value of the euro against the dollar will be next year. The bond yields give a clear indication of a strong US dollar relative to the euro, yet the trade balance and the Trump effect are much more ambiguous. My forecast will be that I expect the dollar to appreciate a little compared to the euro and therefore I estimate the chances of the value of the euro against the dollar to be between $1 and $1.10 70%. Furthermore I indicate a 20% chance for the value to be between $0.90 and a $15% chance for the value to be between $1.10 and $1.20."

The Fed is very likely to raise rates three more times this year. Tough to see the Eurozone matching even one of those moves. So we have to see the exchange rate going downward, all other things being equal. That is what I think is going to finally drive the price below 1.04, which has been a strong support for about two years now. Once through that we have parity, which is usually a big psychological barrier. But my bet is that even that will be pierced during the next nine months. Going below 0.90 seems tough. More than 1.20 seems virtually impossible, unless we have a major adverse event that would be complicated to even elucidate, much less predict. Given the overall downtrend, between 1.10 and 1.20 seems very unlikely also. The range to focus on are the bottom three."
