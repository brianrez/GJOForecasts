I'm expecting some fluctuations over next few weeks as the holiday season and recent news about easing restrictions may affect schedules, but expecting a 7-day av. 155-185K to be maintained overall. Anticipating a marginal increase in next two weeks to reflect the increasing rate of 1st doses late May, as 8-wk gaps between doses become the norm; if all goes well this will provide a slight buffer against missed appointments and other drop-offs. This may be critical, as I expect more variance in August due to holidays. I'm looking for other warning signs that rates may drop, but I still think the issues with Delta cases, and the requirement for full doses to travel should be enough to keep encouraging people continuing with second doses as booked. Target date range 23th August - 30th August."

I was concerned about the potential for the summer holiday break to potentially delay the process however given the recent change in government attitude on quarentines it seems likely that what delays that do happen will be overtaken by people bringing vaccination dates forwards. further discusison about shortening time between vaccinations back to manufacturer guidance seems to indicate a potential for a sooner target date but still in August, daily rate for 2nd doses needs to be over 350k per day to complete before the end of this month ( which is possible from an infrastructure perspective ) which is an effective doubling of the current run rate, unlikely to occur."

But I think a few factors could marginally improve the schedule. The delta variant is now widespread. Second jabs for over 40s can now be brought forward to 8 weeks (over 50s and 'at risk' groups were already eligible). The entire adult population should have completed first jabs by 19th July - in line with the delayed lockdown easing - so there are strong political as well as health incentives to get the first round complete by then. In early July there should be increasing availability for the second doses as first doses taper off, which suggests other age groups will also be able to bring the date forward. Some groups may have this gap reduced further, but likely still in August. So a potential for 80% by mid-end August."

This also aligns with the minimum expected gap between doses. Most people over 50 have had their second dose already, so the 2nd dose rate will be dependent on ~18-50 yrs groups, which I think are likely to complete the course. My expectation is that the impact of the delta variant and summer travel requirements will offset any disincentives, and many wealthier families may even book second doses earlier to allow flights abroad (a small proportion but enough to keep a steady trend throughout July). Any slight slowing from this will clearly push things into September though, when the issue of holidays abroad is negated, so it is still quite open."

Arguments for faster: - once 1st doses are done, 2nd doses can ramp up more - Govt probably putting more pressure to speed up because of variant concerns, and there is a possibility that England has a stockpile that it can accelerate through. - Under 40s second doses are being brought forward to 8-week window rather than 12-week, as were over 50s. This could also happen for younger age groups. Arguments for slower: - Possibly supply issues, but I don't know if that's plausible. - Maybe uptake issuess for younger age groups, but uptake has been very high so far."

It’s taken about 6 weeks to get from 20 to 50pc to expect it to take at least 6 weeks from now as it will get harder to get to 80pc as we keep going Rates can’t go faster really as the time between 1st and 2nd does needs to be quite consistent. And also you are asked to book 2nd dose at time of 1st in most cases so the next 6 weeks will already be fairly well planned in. This gives somewhere around the end July beginning Aug. More likely Aug with slowing rates. And possibility of never getting to 80pc too. However getting the vaccine seems fairly well, established and a lot of work has been done to try and increase update amount communities that are typically quite resistant. If people have gone for first I think they will go to get the second given how efficient and easy the whole process is. In and out in less than 5 mins if not driving and 20mins if driving! Means even people who struggle for time can nip out at lunchtime."

And if it continues its linear trajectory for second doses it would hit in mid July. But I decided my initial look at this was too confident on the second doses trend continuing. The slope of the first doses decreased starting around 50%, where second doses are now. I think overall it's possible to hit 80%. First doses are at 75% and don't look to be slowing down, so I think hitting 80% is very possible. If the same trend for second doses is followed it would hit in mind July. If the trend slows down like first doses did I'm projecting sometime in September. So I'm putting most of the weight between there."
