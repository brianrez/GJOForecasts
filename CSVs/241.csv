In recent years, inflation has typically been steepest in the first half of the year, flattens roughly from May through July or August, has a small peak in Oct, and stays flat or falls through Dec.

Core inflation will need to continue at pace to maintain year on year over that period. Whilst these are coming off shelter prices are expected to contribute more going forward, but the relationship between indices like Case Shiller and CPI are much weaker since the move to surveys to focus on the implicit value of services https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2021/09/09/housing-prices-and-inflation/. Taking these with a pinch of salt but to get a rough idea of magnitude assuming the 11 basis points and 16 month lag from the above, I calculate that this sharp increase in house prices could contribute an additional 3.19 to the index over the course of the year to the end of August. I'd expect the bank rate to have started to have an effect by the end of the forecast although I'm not sure to what extent, and the increases should have more purchase on core inflation. Central estimate by the end of the year from the FOMC is 4.1 core PCE so very roughly adding 0.3-0.5pp they seem to be expecting something around 4.5% CPI yoy to the end of December at the moment."

Core inflation over the past months was equivalent to 0.46%/month. To date, 2.32% from Aug 2021 to Jan 2021, 5 months. Inflation at 0.46%/month for the remainder of the period => 5.7% annual for Aug 2022. Inflation at 0.6%/month for the remainder of the period => 6.7% annual for Aug 2022. Inflation at 0.7%/month for the remainder of the period => 7.4% annual for Aug 2022. With the situation in Ukraine, it's hard to see how core inflation would go down, even though energy isn't counted, just because the price of energy gets factored into everything. Also, fossil fuels are only one of the many products coming out of Russia and Ukraine that the world depends on. But it's not clear just how much the Ukraine situation will increase core inflation."
