We are flirting with the boundary of bin 2 as the question finishes up. There are 4 unreported weeks remaining. Breaking into bin 3 requires a one unit increment from the L48 during the next four reports while Alaska holds above 450. It is very possible, but there are a lot of ways for things to miss. My biggest concern at this point is that Alaska's production is hoovering right at the edge. Preliminary data suggests that we saw a very slight decrease this week. Even a 1,000 b/d decrease would render this question over. We may know the answer when the next data point is posted later this week."

At present growth rates, would expect it to take only a couple more months at most to exceed bin #2. The next big question remains: at what point in time will production growth start noticeably tapering to a new, higher equilibrium level? Once production begins, anything less than an epic crash will not be enough to shut in / truncate newly tapped production volumes, and pre-price climb (~1H21) baseline decline does not seem to be high, so I’m making an “informed assumption” in my forecasts on this question that once production rises above any given level (and allowing for small short-term fluctuations of ~100 kb/d or less), there is no credible scenario within our timeframe where production will ever “peak” and fall significantly lower than any recently observed / established level. In short: the ultimate maximum we are forecasting is very likely to express close to the end date, unless there is soon a major (and extremely unlikely) turn-around in prices. There is still a very wide range of outcomes in play!"

USA is almost self-sufficient with 3% import from Russia, likely covered by domestic increase. Release of strategic reserves to compensate world demand should not affect the US production. Forecasts were released by EIA for 22/23 prior to the war, but remain a good reference for capacity increase. Hence despite the current world situation, we don't believe that a massive increase of production will happen (on a 4-week rolling basis) in such a short time horizon as 2022. That said, the pricing levels seem to support local initiatives in particular in the domain of shale oil. The forecast is center around a linear growth of ~8% corresponding to both the last 12m observed growth and the EIA projections, with a smaller chance to come lower (target metric is the ""max""), and limited chances of large increase given the production constraints. Also OPEC's recent announcement of production increase will calm US entrepreneurship down."
