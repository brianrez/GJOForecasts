Judging by performances so far, their chances of winning the last group match against Australia on Sunday are no better than 60%. Their likely semi final opponents are the West Indies who have been playing well till now, so I'd say India's chances of beating them are 50% at best. If they get through to the finals, they could be up against New Zealand who beat them convincingly in their group match, so again 50% at best."

14510,2016-01-08T06:57:04Z,1,[29.0],[29.0],"There are four usual suspects (title contenders) in any ICC world cricket championship - Australia, India, South Africa and Sri Lanka. IPL has given the key players (if not all playing 11) of all these countries enough experience in Indian conditions. So to start with, the base rate probability of each one winning the title should be 25%. I would not read much into recent T-20 results especially in bi-lateral matches. South Africa mostly does well in these low stake matches while India does better in world cups. On top of that, India's home support give definite edge to India. That said, T20 remains the most difficult version to call. T20 world cups have produced 5 different winners in previous 5 editions. On the other hand, 4 out the past 5 50-over world cup tournaments have been won by Australia. So we can not ascribe significantly high probability to any one nation. Now to maths: India can advance to next stage (semi-final) by either winning the group or coming second. I estimate that India has 36% probability of winning the group and 45% of coming second. I have just considered one path to the top - winning all its matches. Similarly, there is 45% probability that India loses just one of its four matches which will ensure at least a second spot in the group. I know there could be other permutations also but that would only increase the probability (apart from increasing the complexity to calculate the odds)."

(Australia and India recently). Indian pitches are distinctive. Countries seem to be getting worse at playing away. India have IPL so lots of experience. But lots of international players take part too. The two factors above make me want to put the probability nearer 35% Previous T20 world cups: India have won one of the five (the first in 2007 in SA). Came 2nd once in 2014. Sri Lanka have won once with two seconds. No team has won twice. India ODI and T20 ranking: They are 2nd in the ODI rankings, but 8th(!!!) in the T20 rankings. This makes me want to lower the probability to below the base rate! Recent T20 results: Lost 2-0 to SA at home. Drew 1-1 with Zim away. They’ve only won one T20 series (a lone T20 in 2013/14 at home against Aus) going back to 2012. But long term form in T20 doesn’t really exist. I think home advantage and conditions will prove vital. The Asian nations also have a warm up tournament. Some pundits are touting SA with their strong one day batting, but I think Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Australia and India are the best shouts. England and New Zealand probably don’t have the right talents for the conditions. Game theory makes me think I should stick my neck out and show some confidence in India, even though it’ll cost me if I’m wrong."

In addition to the obvious home advantage, the Indian team is well balanced and has an ideal balance for a twenty 20, with aggressive batsmen, top notch fast bowlers and reliable spinners. The team that may threaten India for the title is South Africa (which clobbered India in an ODI series recently). However, others such as Sri Lanka and Pakistan may surprise as well.
