What will the short-term interest rate be for Australia (AUS) in October 2017?,2017-10-04T16:00:05Z,2017-10-31T06:59:05Z,"Between 1.68 and 1.72, inclusive","['Less than 1.68', 'Between 1.68 and 1.72, inclusive', 'More than 1.72']",['Economic Indicators'],193,654,77,237,"This question will be resolved using monthly data reported by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Data is retrievable via download or on the 'Short-term interest rates' table on the web site. The relevant country can be found in the HIGHLIGHTED COUNTRIES or LOCATION field, and the relevant time period can be found in the TIME field. Values will be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth.

On the other hand, every other source I've found claims the rate for Sept. was 1.71.
