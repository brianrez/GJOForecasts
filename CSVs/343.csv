The CPTPP involves high level rules that govern services, investment, intellectual property, digital trade and state-owned enterprises. There are commitments to liberalisation, inhibition of government interference and business protection. Beijing may have problems complying with these plus the issues concerning labour rights, the Uighurs and the repression in Hong Kong. There have also been problems over trade with Australia due to questions over the origin of Covid-19 and political detentions of Canadians to force the release of the Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei detained over fraud charges in the U.S. Mainland China has also reacted vociferously to Taiwan’s application to join the trade agreement, by making its position clear as to its opposition to all official interactions with or accession to any agreement with Taiwan. This is as a non-member to the CPTPP and may be considered presumptuous by the members of the trade agreement. Although there is precedence here where China that Taiwan was only allowed to join the WHO as a separate customs territory and only after China had obtained its membership. Taiwan has had progress over trade agreements with the U.S. and the EU who are both willing to support it over its stance with democracy and free market policies. One member who will perhaps support China’s bid for membership and be against Taiwan’s bid will be New Zealand who has shown a willingness to maintain fruitful relations with China over its status as its largest trade partner that has managed to disturb the other members of the ‘Five Eyes’ intelligence grouping. Therefore, given China’s probable non-compliance (and perhaps belligerence and bellicose statements/ actions) and New Zealand’s pragmatism over the protection of its major export market, neither China or Taiwan will gain membership of the CPTPP."
