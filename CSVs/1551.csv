Will ACLED record any civilian fatalities in Tunisia between 15 October 2017 and 31 October 2017?,2017-10-11T16:00:26Z,2017-11-01T03:59:26Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],134,654,62,237,"The Armed Conflict Location and Event Dataset (ACLED) summarizes press reports on conflict and protest events in Africa and parts of Asia. Outcome will be determined by the ""Realtime [Month of Interest] All Africa File"" found on the Realtime Data page (ACLED). The question will resolve as ""yes"" if ACLED records any event for which: 'COUNTRY' is the country of interest; 'EVENT_DATE' falls in the period of interest; and 'EVENT_TYPE' is Violence against civilians, or Remote violence; and 'FATALITIES' is greater than or equal to 1. Question will be resolved when the relevant data is first released. If a qualifying event is recorded, the question will be closed retroactively with the date of the first event as the end date of the question. Confused?
