The latest stats have a breakdown as to reasons for people not travelling to work and of the 27% who do not, 55% is due to the employer asking them not to work from home and 47% due to following government guidelines to work from home. Government guidelines to work from home where possible look like they are not going to change despite the easing of restrictions on 17th May so I don't see this figure changing much. Also people who prefer to or normally work from home are probably not probably going to change that much either. Some more workplaces might open but only 25% of respondents said their workplace is closed so even assuming they all stop working entirely from home that's not enough to get the overall percentage to 20 even if they all opened. A drop of that magnitude in WEFH rates happened before (around mid June 2020) but that coincided with a more significant easing of lockdown restrictions and was from a higher level, to get from 27%-20% last year took a couple of months. So I am struggling to see any route to get to 20% by 4 June. If it were to happen it would probably be due to a significant re-opening of workplaces combined with more employers dropping guidance to work entirely from home and significantly increased confidence meaning people choose to take up that option. Simply due to the numbers required and the historical record i am rating this as only a 9% probability and will shift even lower if there's no big drop after the easing if restrictions in May 17th."

There are 3 reports before 4 June so I still there's a chance office visits, meetings, site visits etc increase over the next couple of weeks and push that figure further down, especially as 17 May sees the opening of indoor hospitality and lifting of other restrictions. Anecdotally I see a lot of people who have worked almost exclusively at home since March 2020 now going into the office one day a week or having a day of meetings. If the end date for this question were even two weeks later I'd be more confident and stick to my earlier +50 prediction."

These trends look pretty linear, so we can roughly estimate that in the next month they'll be sitting at 70-75% of the population with at least one dose, and perhaps over 50% with both doses. While the ONS is definitely showing a move away from WFH (27% as of late April) and an increase in any amount of commuting to work (+2%), given that the UK won't quite be at the numbers associated with herd immunity yet, I would think they stay above 20%. Cases have stabilized and deaths are decreasing though, so things may move faster in this regard. If the +2% trend away from WFH continues or accelerates, it could certainly close the gap between 27% and the target 20%."

Most working class jobs need workers to be present (delivery drivers, binmen, tradespeople, gig workers, etc), and there are increasing signs that employers are coming to demand this despite government advice to allow home working. Subjectively, increasingly workers are getting fed up with beig at home, going by social and news media reports, and realising that WFH results in longer working hours and a disruption to any work-life balance, plus promotion chances are lessened if you're not 'on the ground' and working with managers.

The UK's total population sits at around 68 million people, so, conservatively, if vaccination speed does not pick up and we assume everyone is getting 2 doses, that means 50% of the population will be vaccinated by the beginning of June. On the other side according to https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2020/oct/26/the-great-rebalancing-working-from-home-fuels-rise-of-the-secondary-city (I fully admit to not reading all the sources referenced), about 31% of UK jobs can be performed from home, and 86% of employers have indicated their intention to implement WFH to at least some degree post-pandemic. But how much will be exclusively WFH? Given the vaccination trajectory, it's like that a majority of people would have received at least a single dose by June 4th, though I doubt this will lead to a lifting of restrictions (or suggestions) by then, so I see it unlikely there would be huge progress towards whatever the post-pandemic ""steady state"" will be (which I do think will be <20% exclusively WFH and probably closer to 10-15%)."

Roughly this seemed to covary with the number of cases though there was a slight lag as by then the second wave was starting. In Dec the percentage was 28%, slightly less than earlier in 2020 possibly reflecting the slightly less stringent terms of the lockdown at that point. So I think the base rate is that it takes about 6 months from peak cases to WFH going down to 20%, which absent other factors makes it reasonable to plump for 4 June as roughly when cases might again drop to that level. However the major difference is the vaccine rollout, it won't have reached most of the working population by then but I think it will mean it's a good bet cases and hospital admissions will be down further this 6months than after the first peak. So tilting estimate more towards less than 20% WFH."

This concludes that employees return to work shifted on month from falling case number. If we assume that the vaccination campaign goes well restrictions could eased by April[3]. Including the one month shift most employees would probably return to work in May. I think cases will be still a lot higher than in last July but because of a lower death rate it is safer and more accepted to go back to work.

Large companies have been looking to reduce office space and its ancillary costs (cleaning , security, utilities etc) therefore costs by moving some personnel to remote locations (home). An example of this is Linklaters the UK Law firm. A disadvantage to the company, especially its middle management would be the loss of control and supervision, although this could be countered by employees being paid by production of work (having been pre-packaged), rather than the time being present in the office. The advantages to the employee would be the avoidance of the daily drudgery and cost of commuting and a better life balance (depending on family relations, children, pets etc). The disadvantages to the employee would the loss of the office camaraderie and peer-based support and learning plus the potential of the company to turn its business into a gig style economy with potential loss in holiday, sickness benefits. The company ‘mission statement could probably be dispensed with (a plus). This separation of some employees to a home-based system could have a silver lining in that discrimination in its various forms (age, gender, race, disability etc) could be eradicated. A further issue is that some employees may not be able, or have the inclination to work alone, at home. Therefore, a simple forecast as to the percentage of workers working from home is somewhat complex and my proposal at this time would be a figure below 20%."

Assuming, the UK needs to vaccinate everyone above 65 (12 million people) and then say 40% of all 16-64 years olds (40m), which would give you coverage of 40% (probably below the minimum needed https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(20)30284-1/fulltext), that would take 104 million doses.
