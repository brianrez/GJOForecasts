It's a smoke and mirrors technology put out by an industry that has not yet faced the fact that people lack the time to consume ever more data. There is only so much video in a month that someone can watch, and 4G does a pretty good job of doing it, and 5G is not the revolutionary jump that 3G to 4G was. The killer app is not video for 5G because it doesn't carry much more data per HZ than 4G. 5Gs killer app is ultra low latency application. Which requires an ultra dense (expensive) network to work. Autonomous cars for instance. But AI, and pushing it to the edge, into the car, deflates the need for 5G low latency. 5G is about fast setup and tear down time of the comms link. Not congesting the signalling side of the network with slow session setup. Read IOT.... Read electricity metres and vending machines... Read penny's, not rivers of ARPU gold. And so, while a great marketing event, the investors of Telco, the pension and Etf funds, are wary of allowing the engineers freedom to invest heavily in an industry where customers consumption has reached saturation, and future growth is in the machine comms, but AI in the machines means local autonomy in decision making, which means very low bandwidth, sending situation reports back to base, not...
