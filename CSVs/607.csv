If the negotiations have persisted through the turbulence of COVID-19 and despite the concerns raised from the US and India, the EU is moving forward with the negotiations. I give it about even chances they will make the agreement by the deadline, but I think both China and the EU see the agreement as essential and will be willing to make the necessary concessions (for China that means at least on paper). China needs it as political win after its stumbles during COVID19 and pulling key US allies further away from the US. The EU needs it for the financial benefit for Europeans (even if the main beneficiary and proponent of the deal is Germany) especially given the economic impacts from COVID19.

The Agreement is still pending for ratification by the European Parliament (EP), which has echoed the growing concern over China’s human rights record. Furthermore, following the designation of several Chinese officials under the EU global human rights sanctions regime, Beijing retaliated by sanctioning EU lawmakers, diplomats and other institutions. In response to these hostilities, the EP overwhelmingly adopted a resolution demanding the lifting of sanctions against MEPs before proceeding with any discussions on the ratification. Besides, Chancellor Angela Merkel – the main promoter of the CAI during the German presidency of the Council – is leaving office in September and the German Green Party – a fierce critic of the Agreement – is high in the polls. As the political context that fostered the CAI vanishes, its ratification will remain frozen until EU-China relations steer into calmer waters.”"

There are also provisions within the agreement to implement the Paris accord on climate change and Labour conventions concerning forced labour. Since an agreement in principle was produced in December 2020, there has been a deterioration of relations between the participants. In March 2021 the EU joined the US, UK, and Canada in sanctions against Chinese Communist Party officials, the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau, and others, concerning human rights abuses against the Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities. China retaliated by placing sanctions on ‘a number of think tanks, scholars, and European Parliament politician, that included every member of the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights, its Political and Security Committee, five other members of parliament, and 27 EU ambassadors’. The EU responded to this on May 20, 2021, by freezing the ratification of the CAI agreement. Angela Merkel has said that the CAI is important despite ratification difficulties and that climate change, WTO issues and other global issues will not be solved without China. It may be presumed, however, that her influence is waning due to her standing down. The agreement is not dead with both sides willing to restart the ratification process with measured responses from the Chines State Media and favourable comments from Chinese politicians. China is unlikely to compromise on its views of Human rights, industrial policy or national security, but it was a German that coined the term ‘realpolitik’, where pragmatic political decisions may override any moral or ideological considerations."

Interesting to note who the traget audience was in this case, the BDI (German Confederation of Industry) which clearly has a mandate and policy to promote German Industry (https://bit.ly/3qfrnb4). The BDI has a clear approach to PRC and there's no doubt that the BDI aligns with the EU and probably contributed to Merkel's motive to push for the CAI during Germany's term as EU president in 2020.

That, I believe is a valid question. Thus, considering the recent confusion about who should be the CSU / CDU candidate to succeed Merkel and the recent showing of the Greens in regional elections, Germany may well be in for a change of Chancellor and dominant political party. The Greens? Maybe. It would seem they will carry more weight even if one assume that the current coalition retains the chancellorship. Thus, in all likelihood, there will be a change of focus in German politics, IMO. See https://bit.ly/3gzHfTa. Equally, one should not exclude increased influence from the AfD. This all seems to portend a change in German politics that is likely to disrupt the current cosy relationship between the business and ruling classes. Will this be good for Germany's support of the CAI? a Merkel flagship project in her terminal days and her last term as EU President? I do not think so."

Will China lift the sanctions? Possibly. However, in the next few months is unlikely. That delay of 1, 2, 3 or 4 months will simply delay the EU ratification process. Probably beyond the 1 January 2022. As @Wildwood2000 pointed out, China is the clear winner in the current draft.
