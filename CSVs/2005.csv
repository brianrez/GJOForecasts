This gave a probability of 50%, 20% and 30% respectively - The next step I took was to look at how employment growth % in January followed the previous quarter (average of Oct, Nov and Dec) in the previous 10 years. Then, using the 2015 Q4 employment data, I used the % growth for each year to calculate how many more jobs would have been created in January. This provides a probability of 60%, 10%, and 30% for each group - Given that this data includes a number of months where growth was negative, I then analyse the likelihood of negative growth occurring in January, as the recessionary years have a large impact on the overall probability - Initial jobless claims rose in the week ended Jan 9 by 7,000 (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-14/initial-jobless-claims-in-u-s-unexpectedly-increased-last-week) - The increase in interest rates may cause a slowdown in employment, but I would expect the results of this to lag a number of months as the effects on investment and recruitment feed through (I also expect the result to be mild) - Employment is also at it's highest in the last 10 years, and given the slow level of growth in the economy, some doubt whether further growth in jobs is sustainable given the rapid job growth in 2015 - The likelihood of a recession in January is low, given that we are already two-thirds of the way through the month. Assuming that the economy returns to a recession on average once every 6 years, this gives a probability of 17% that a recession will occur in any given year. Citi (http://uk.businessinsider.com/r-watch-for-us-recession-zero-interest-rates-in-china-next-year-citi-says-2015-12?r=US&IR=T) predict a probability of 65% of a recession in 2016, although my expectation is that this is punchy given the fed's optimism about the economy. I would still expect the probability in 2016 to be greater than 17%, so lets meet in the middle at 41%. By pro-rating -"

Also based on data since 2011, I created a linear model, (Jobs in month n) = 0.22*(Jobs in month n-1) + 160 + (error with SD of 74) This model suggests a similar estimate as the base rate estimate above. I don't understand why the crowd is so confident that the number of new jobs will be between 175-225k; that is a fairly small range given the typical variation."
