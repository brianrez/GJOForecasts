But a new study published in JAMA Psychiatry , a journal, gives food for thought. Researchers compared “cannabis use disorder” in Washington, Colorado, Oregon and Alaska—the first states to legalise recreational marijuana use—against states in which recreational pot is still prohibited. CUD is medicalese for uncontrolled use. It is characterised by high tolerance levels, failed attempts to quit, or abdicating important activities to smoke. In adults over 26 years old, this rose by 37% more in states in which the drug is legal than elsewhere. Frequent use (at least 20 days of the preceding month) increased an extra 23%. Most troubling is the 25% greater uptick in CUD in children aged 12-17. An associated editorial warns that as more states consider legalisation, these health warnings must be weighed against the acknowledged “social-justice goals” of more liberal drug laws.”"

Supposedly McConnell met with Marijuana Financiers about this bill recently, which gives me some confidence he will let it come to a vote, where it seems highly likely to pass. [1] Trump seems to have been pretty inconsistent on Marijuana, sometimes saying states should be allowed to legalize it and sometimes saying states should only allow medicinal marijuana.
