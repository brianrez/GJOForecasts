Not a perfect outside view but certainly one to keep in mind. Further, I referred to @mattlerner 's comment which suggested in Lebannon the base rate for non-postponement is 70%. I give much more credence to that metric so wanted to heavily weigh my outside view there to begin. So I started at 70% and then took some off given Logan's datapoint. So starting off I'll give the Before Apri the highest likelihood. Beyond that, I'm giving the ""not before June 1"" a slightly larger likelihood of happening given the country's motivation not to host the election during the fasting month of Ramandan -- which takes a lot of time off the table for the ""Between April, May"" option. That said, I've also referred to a couple of articles (https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/lebanese-president-baulks-march-polls-amid-economic-meltdown-2021-11-19/ and https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/geagea-says-delaying-vote-would-condemn-lebanon-slow-death-2021-11-30/) which do suggest some likelihood of a postponement -- or at least some contempt for the March date. For now, I'll stick to a ~2/3 chance it's ontime with a 1/3 chance is gets postponed, with a skew towards June+."
