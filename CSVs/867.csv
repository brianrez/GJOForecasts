After previous dips in approval ratings (2005, 2013) approval numbers quickly increased and remained stable for a number of years. Presidents acting during states of emergency have better odds of being reelected. Putin has functioned as (acting) president of Russia for 17 years (212.5% of the usual 8 years). Medvedev and the entire cabinet have already resigned on 15 January 2020 in order for Putin to make constitutional changes that would ""significantly change Russia's balance of power"", and the government has been continuing their duties as a mere caretaker government since.

Reviewing Putin though, he leaves nothing to chance and a bird in the hand now (ie this year) is worth more than the risk of delay. Who knows what could happen next year so given the chance, my belief is he will bet on the certainty of the referendum touted. Unless he botches covid, the result looks certain for him. It does no-one any harm knowing he will will be around for the next 10 years. Even better to do it in a US election year. So my guess is later in the year if covid restrictions allow voting."

At the moment I have no strong view on it but it seems probable that sooner is better than later. So I think more likely this year than later next year. Keep under review.

The popular vote is not necessary but Putin wants it to look legitimate of course. He's not above rigging votes so the chance that he would win the votes is something like 95% (he had 77% on his reelection in 2018). The most difficult factor is whether it will be adopted in 2021 with the Coronavirus situation. Putin will want to do the voting as quickly as possible. With 8 months left I think it is 95% likely that the vote will be held in 2021 => 0.95*0.95 = 0.9025 = 90%

Additionally, the current global economy, COVID-19 situation, and oil pricing wars impact Russia uniquely and signal a high level of impending uncertainty. Many of the constitutional changes include changing Russian laws regarding international norms, the race to enhance Russia's position as a global and strategic influence, and the proliferation of Russia's military, as well as improvements surrounding pensions and the slowing birth-rate. The mere-exposure effect demonstrates that many people will support a candidate based on their presence in the media and name recognition, therefore this demonstrates that many Russian people, who have witnessed Putin's twenty years in office hold a, ""if not Putin, then who?"" mentality. Lastly, both the Duma and various regional legislators in Russia have already endorsed this move, which reflects early support that will allow for a large margin of time to gain momentum between now and January 2021."
