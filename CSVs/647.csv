However, it is reasonable to assume that the countries that have held out to this day are more staunch in their support of Taiwan. Thus, I’m estimating down to 5 countries switching from 2021-2040. (Assuming of course, the status quo that the ROC is not taken over by the PRC) At this rate, over the next 20 years it is one county switching every 4 years, which is equivalent to 1 country every 48 months. The forecast period is from 9 Nov to 28 Feb. At the time of this forecast (1 Jan 2021) there are only two months remaining, and takeover of the ROC by the PRC appears unlikely. Since on average it is 48 months for a country to switch by my estimate, the chances are 2/48 = 4.2% of a country ceasing to recognize Taiwan by 28 Feb 2021."

The other countries, that are not small island nations among the 14, are South American countries, thus likely to be pressured by China to follow the one China Policy. Becasue of the rate of investment by China around the globe currently, the nature and position of the countries who recognize Taiwan as a country, and the commitment level of China to its One China Policy and its mechanism of enforcing it with economic partners, a likelihood of this event is great. What would change my mind would be a voluntary agreement between China and Taiwan of some sort of partnership, similar to that of Hong Kong and China while GB was leasing Hong Kong. This would then eliminate the need to recognize or not recognize Taiwan as a sovereign country by others.

Additionally, the Solomon Islands' recent decision in 2019 to withdraw support for Tawain has been met with negative internal and external political pressure, which may deter other countries from pursuing a potentially controversial decision during a pandemic.

87841,2020-11-12T21:49:27Z,1,[30.0],[30.0],"Taiwan has lost an average 1.75 countries' recognition each year from Jan 2016 through 2019 (for a total of 7 states over this period). This period of time reflects a renewed campaign by the Chinese to encourage realignment to the PRC from Taiwan, following an eight-year period of diplomatic ""truce"" under Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou. The PRC threatened that if Tsai Ing-yen was reelected in January 2020 (in an article in the People's Daily), Taiwan would find itself without any diplomatic allies. It seems then that this base rate of losing 1.75 country allies each year should continue in 2020 and 2021, given the PRC's renewed commitment to destroying Taiwan's diplomatic recognition under Tsai's leadership. I'd put the rate fairly high given that there were no realignments yet in 2020. That said, given that a hard core pro-Taiwan president is leaving and the potential for a softer line from the incoming administration, if I were a tiny nation considering realignment, I'd do it after the hard-core administration leaves office and minimize any chance for adverse policy against me from the US. This takes my 45% probability down to 30%. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102519/"

Most of these states are small in size and influence on the world. While this list is small, it is not decreasing quickly. Only four states have ceased to recognize the ROC in the past 10 years, with the Solomon Islands being the most recent in 2019. Given the rate of abandonment and small number of states with current recognition, the probability that another state ceases to formally recognize Taiwan in these next three months is very low. While China is growing its own economy and influence throughout the world with projects such as the BRI, there is little evidence to suggest this particular event will occur in this timeframe."

Currently only 14 of the 193 UN countries recognize Taiwan: Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Paraguay, Nicaragua, Belize, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent And The Grenadines, Marshall Islands, Saint Kitts And Nevis, Palau, Tuvalu, Nauru, and Vatican City. Given China's significant move to have influence within South America I think it is very possible that one of these South American countries will no longer recognize Taiwan in the near future."

As mentioned 2 other countries in 2019 have ceased to recognize ROC. Therefore, in the 40ish years 3 countries have ceased to recognize Taiwan (a rate of 3/40 = 7%). Without much more research this is where I would start my forecast. The remining 14 countries are mostly smaller nations and I feel like would have little political gains by switching their recognition. With that said I am not familiar with any push by China within the remaining 14 nations to gain political leverage, which could cause a flip in recognition."

Approx ~.5 countries cease to recognize Taiwan every four month period (50/50). Today, only 14 countries maintain full diplomatic relations with Taiwan. I tend to think that as the number of countries in question is reduced, so is the base rate. For this first estimate, I go slightly below the 2016-2019 base rate (45%)."
96755,2020-11-12T17:42:36Z,1,[29.0],[29.0],"Assuming that recognition means formal diplomatic relations with an embassy (which means that the US does not recognize the ROC), only 14 nations (and the Holy See) out of 193 recognize Taiwan. Of those 14 countries at the highest risk of changing relationships with Taiwan are those that would most benefit from an enhanced relationship with China especially Chinese investment. I would denote these as Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, or Haiti. In the last 72 years, approximately 114 changes in recognition from the ROC to PRC have occurred with tight grouping in the two 5 year periods after the Communist victory in the civil war in 1949 and after Nixon's visit to China in 1972. This gives a rate of 1 change of recognition to the PRC per every 7.6 months. The rate over the last 30 years has been 1 change per every 1.30 years. Averaging these two rates gives a change of 1 per every 0.97 years. Therefore, I would estimate that the occurrence of a derecognition event over the period from today to 28 Feb (108 days) is (108/365.24 * 0.9667) = 28.6%. I could not find any particular information (trade deals, coercion, diplomatic exchanges) about the 4 countries (or any of the other 10) listed above that makes me believe compellingly that they are any more or less likely to derecognize the ROC in favor of the PRC than the baseline over the next 108 days, ergo 28.6%. I admit that I would prefer a complex Bayesian decision model to explain this problem, but given the relatively large sample size of derecognitions and the paucity of data on internal interstate negotiations between the PRC and these 14 nations, I see no valid reason to disregard a frequentist approach as specious. The main driver for approaching this problem from a Bayesian modeling standpoint would be if the pool of countries recognizing the ROC dropped below ~10, then individual decision-making and detailed information should become more deterministic of the outcome."

In 2020, there were zero, which bucks a minor trend. Unsure of what the smaller countries still recognizing Taiwan gain from that declaration (could probably find out from more research), but of the 6 that have switched since 2016, three of them are located in the CONCACAF region of the world (in terms of soccer federations). Since 6 of the remaining 15 are in CONCACAF and we have not seen another switch yet, I forecast that it is possible we could see one of them follow suit and switch from ROC to PRC before Feb 2021, although there is something to also be said for no cease of recognition occurring for whatever reason in 2020."

To limit the boundaries, in the last 4 years, 6 countries (from Oceania and Central/South America) have ceased relations. Currently, there are only 15 countries that recognize the ROC. Of those 15, 13 are in Oceania and the Central/South America. Since 2019, China has increased its influence in these areas, especially with those countries that recognize the ROC. There is then a likelihood that another country will cease recognition of the ROC. However, an outside view is that the US may begin to place pressure on these countries as well to reduce Chinese influence. The issue is the timeframe. There are currently 108 days until the end of February 2021. With that in mind and the US administration change in January, I believe the likelihood could increase because of that."

As there are fewer states that currently recognize Taiwan, the probability decreases that one will cease to. Most of the states that currently recognize Taiwan are tiny island nations or Central/South American nations that may not be as invested in the PRC and therefore don't feel threatened by recognizing Taiwan. As China's influence continues to grow, even these nations might feel the need to switch allegiances. But that probability remains low over the next 3.5 months."
