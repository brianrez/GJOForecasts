"Between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, will an armed group from the Philippines engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in the Philippines?",2018-04-02T17:00:08Z,2018-07-01T06:59:08Z,Yes,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],118,654,57,237,"The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (The Early Warning Project). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 30 June 2018 and will be resolved in April 2019 after EWP assesses the situation in the Philippines from April 2018 to March 2019. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilian fatalities occur in one or more campaigns. See (EWP) for examples.

Previously, in March 2017 (before our question period began), HRW published a report stating that 7,000 people, mostly poor drug users, had been killed by police and vigilantes in the war on drugs. Thus, HRW estimates that approximately 5,000 have died in the time period in question. Although it is unknown what proportion of these fatalities was the result of systematic government action, the HRW numbers being so high above the 1,000-death threshold and evidence of a continuing systematic government campaign against drug dealers and users leads us to determine that this questions should be resolved as ‚Äòyes.‚Äô (In our annual 2017 report we determined that there was an onset of mass killing in the Philippines in 2016, see more in our 2016 State of the World report.)"
