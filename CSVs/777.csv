I struggle to interpret the news on tiktok with regards to facebook's future, but when you look at it closely, the risk of espionage on personal data (especially when they get lost by the company) is not so much different from the one in facebook's data pile, so recommendations of the pentagon may also apply to facebook and their lax data handling. Combining this with the repeated congressional hearings, it seems to me that ""nationalizing the data stock"" could to be a target of national security authorities in the US with the ""National Security interest"" as a reason, in which a significantly lower prize and finally a buy-out could be the result. facebook already acts like a governmental body in times (e.g. supporting ""predicitve policing""), so why not be a national agency openly in the future?

Furthermore, a 18.5% increase on top of 7% on earnings is also going to occur less than 0.5%, so i set that probability to 0.

In the coming weeks, the largest events that could potentially swing FB's stock price from a sector's perspective are earnings releases on 7/29, as well as big tech's antitrust investigation by Congress. I'd expect earnings to be much more of a wild card, as the latter has been talked about since early this year, and results are general inconclusive, especially given how slow Congress moves on issues. The largest story here is how ad boycotting has affected Facebook during Q2, and if that's enough for investors to be worried about the long-term impact on Facebook's stock price. I'd argue that generally tech will perform at expectations, especially given how they are comparatively less affected by work from home than other industries. Therefore, since FB is at $233 right now, it's most likely to be in the middle bucket but has a larger downside potential than upside, especially given its volatility."

However, earnings are soon and the stock has surged over the second half of the year, and with pandemic improvement, I can see it happening.

There is one important event left (Antitrust testimony) that will occur on 7/29/2020. Given how fairly well-known this event is despite the rescheduling from Monday to Wednesday, I firmly believe that the event volatility has been priced in to the above options. Facebook almost certainly will deny monopolistic behaviors, as seen in the past by other major corporations, which is already reflected in its stock price. However, the directional risk should be move heavily weighted in the downside, as testimony can only ever hurt the stock price.

Just today, FB announced they are postponing their Q2 announcement by a day to allow Zuckerberg to appear before a Congressional hearing. I think this delay, combined with residual volatility from earnings trickling into the week of August 5th, flattens the middle part of the distribution. Even so, the overall tech sector has had positive drift over the last month; even with a massive shock in stock price from earnings, I believe the majority of the distribution still falls in the middle two buckets, with a slight edge to the downside."

Furthermore, it is now possible given a tumultuous state of events on earning day that the stock inches 200, but also much less likely to close over 290, changing by more than 290 and less than 200 to 1% each.

Modelling FB as a geometric brownian motion over daily prices with a volatility of 3,4% (backed out from call/put annualized implied volatilities on options from now to August 7). This gives a log-return volatility of about 10.75% over the 10-day time period from now to August 5. Given the current stock price of Facebook sits in between two buckets, we should also have a roughly symmetrical distribution. Applying the given volatilities, a brownian motion should have about a 80% chane of staying within the $200-260 bands. I also biased my probabilities upwards as the Fed's continued buying and a new fiscal stimulus bill seem to cap downside on stocks in general, and FAANG sentiment seems to have barely slowed, even on worse than expected earnings from Netflix."

I then calculated probabilities and set these as my base rate.

The world has pretty much accepted Coronavirus, and thus we do not expect any drastic falls so we can rule 200 with probability 0. Now, we must concern the two key events that could affect the Facebook price; the earnings on July 29 and the ongoing agenda of banning political/un-fact checked ads. The earnings typically does not move the price more than 10%, but we must account for a potential 10% move in either direction. Furthermore, the facebook ad ban and hearings have not had a huge impact on the price, as I have spoke to several domain experts and looked at the price. We can now look at the chance of a price over $290, this can happen if they beat earnings and go up (18/31) times, and trend upward after and before. To quantify this, I would put the chance at about 5%. We also know that most likely the price will be around the current price, so we can set that to the highest probability. Furthermore, the upside is more likely than the downside, arriving at my forecast."

This can be used to back out a market-implied CDF for the stock price at expiration. I used option prices in the Aug 7 weekly expiration to find these values using the closest available strikes.

Given the way the question's answer is asked above, I thought it might be a good idea to look at option prices with the strikes corresponding to the bounds above. For example, I could look at a $230 strike put option to estimate the probability that FB price goes below $230. The current price of a July 17 230 put is around $1.47, and the price of an Aug 21 230 put is around $9.45. I don't know the ins and outs of Black Scholes yet, so I can't get an exact volatility measure of some sort (that could be a helpful calculation if someone is skilled in Black Scholes). However, given the lack of a dividend, it's fair to say that a hypothetical Aug 5 230 put would be priced between $1.47 and $9.45. For now, I'll just do a weighted average (by # of business days) of the two dates' options to get 13/25*$1.47 + 12/25*$9.45=$5.300. Likewise, I can get a value of a hypothetical Aug 5 260 option as 13/25*$0.70+12/25*$7.50=$3.964. Doing the same for $200, $290 gives a summary below:"

However, I am not sure how to do it, so I will take a less robust approach to prior calculation. Currently, the stock is at 243 and average vol hovers around 0.32 for the next month. Therefore, I will assume a 2% daily move from now until August. Although I couldn't find FB's Q2 earnings date, last year it's been in late July (July 24th) therefore I expect this year's earnings to be around roughly the same time. I expect this to be a large catalyst given uncertainty around advertiser boycotts, increasing government regulation/scrutiny of the platform, retailer/advertiser bankruptcy (Brooks Brothers, J Crew, etc), and general COVID anxiety. Given this catalyst and the high vol, I expect FB to have a relatively flat normal distribution of returns around the 230-260 bucket. Therefore my prior is a 10, 20, 40, 20, 10 distribution."
