Given the chances of winning in the first round materialized, there is a tendency of voting shift from less popular candidates (Ciro - 7%) and Tebet (5%) to either Lula or Bolsonaro. Because Ciro voters that change their vote are much more likely to vote for Lula (as they are left-wing candidates), and Ciro has more votes, I believe there is a high chance the Lula wins in a margin of 50% to 50,5% of votes. Also, a major, reliable newspaper publish a polls aggregator, pointing to 52% of valid votes for Lula. Altough there are chances that he got stucked between 48,5% and 49,9%.

A third candidate is not seen to break this balance, and Bolsonaro will receive a higher percentage of the punishment vote than the polls expected.

With less than a month to go, things can move but they are unlikely to move drastically*. Thus, 41% or less doesn't seem too likely. Around 46% we have bins 2, 3, and 4, which seem most probable and then there is bin 5 in the event that the currently undecided voters that do end up voting decide to mostly vote for Lula."

By 3 week's time, I expect it to be a closer match. Given that Reuters reported somewhere around 44% for da Silva and projecting forward based on poll data aggregates, I would assume the true number to be lower than 44% and closer to the poll projection of maybe 40%. However, there were moments where it seems Bolsonaro was the heavily unpopular candidate because of his performance with COVID-19 handling in his country of Brazil. So I wouldn't be surprised if a candidate garnered a whopping majority (>50%) of the votes. But 3 week's time may be too short for this to happen, if at all. So I'm really uncertain about the first 3 bins and put a tail on the last bin just in case."
