"Between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2019, will an armed group from South Sudan engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in South Sudan?",2018-12-28T18:00:00Z,2019-03-31T06:59:00Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],80,654,42,237,"The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (Early Warning Project). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 31 March 2019 and will be resolved in January 2020 after EWP assesses the situation in South Sudan from January 2019 to December 2019. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilian fatalities occur in one or more campaigns. See The Early Warning Project for examples. See GJâ€™s FAQ on forecasting questions like this. Confused?

However, several sources have reported also economic interests of the conflict (https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/12/15/south-sudans-neighbours-help-launder-the-loot-from-its-civil-war). As per The Economist, at present there is a (more or less) peace situation thanks to a sharing power deal struck in September but according to International Crisis Group (https://www.crisisgroup.org/crisiswatch#overview) the peace agreements have been violated, and risk of violence escalation at the prospects to lose power in new transitional government in May (with Nuer leader Machar as one of the five VPs). Options: - Economic interest in the region (Sudan) and of the key players force the consolidation of the sharing power government, with the 2022 election as long term goal. 30% (minorities represented by 2 VPs are militarily irrelevant but could be source of violence 10% and ethnic cleansing). - Like in 2016, the Kiir-Machar relation is unsustainable and breaks the peace agreements through conflict. 50%. - One or both players are removed from the scenario, leading to a longer term, less violent relation. 10% However, the level of intensity for civilians seemed to be lower than the 1,000 fatalities the question request, so I apply a 70% reduction to scenario 3 and 50% to scenario 2. Total 20%."

There has been a tendency in media to portray the violence as political, rather than tribal. But the reality on the ground is that politics here, align by tribal affiliation. Multiple protagonists makes the problem that much worse. Nuer- Dinka conflict. Nuer-Murle conflict. Even a chance of violent, punitive reaction and or intervention from Sudan proper. I think that it is likely that there will be has serious burst of violence here resulting in significant loss of life. Old Thumper"
