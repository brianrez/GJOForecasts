And Google Trends tells me that among the Republican candidates in the last 7 days, Begich only accounted for about 45% of search interest and 55% went to Palin. Therefore, if a Republican is projected to win 51% of the time, 55% of 51% is 32%, but with my filtering process that I do with hurricane models, done two various ways to account for uncertainty, I have a weighted average of about 34%, which will be my new forecast."

Depending on Republican turnout, she could get a boost that could possibly shoot here over the 6000 votes needed. However, her unpopularity, which I saw as around 61%, is a huge problem. The surprising part of the special election was that votes where votes as the other Republican in the race as their primary choice, votes for a Democrat as their second choice. That might happen again in the general or people might change their vote knowing it might help a Democrat. Seems to depend on the Republican voters reaction to this win as well."

This is only if Alaskian votes don't like her though."
