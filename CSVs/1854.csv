As pro-government ground forces try to punch through rebel lines, food, fuel and water for the 250,000 or so besieged residents are running dangerously low. Efforts to stop the killing have failed.

Clearly Russia could reduce Aleppo to a pile of rubble as was Grozny by Russia 17 years ago. Humanitarian considerations count little to Putin and Assad. Putin has learnt that, so far atrocities and invasions have not cost him much, The failures of the Russian economy can be blamed on the falling oil prices rather the western sanctions. So the question is what would stop Aleppo being totally destroyed? The answer is that to capture Aleppo requires either the total surrender or the destruction of the anti-government forces. Surrender does not sound like a safe option unless it was part of a general peace deal and included guarantees from countries more trustworthy than Russia and the Syrian Government. At the moment this option does not exist/ This leaves the total destruction of of the anti-government forces as the only current option. The total destruction of the anti-government forces requires ground troops to take Aleppo, yard by yard. If Russia were to supply a large number of ground troops it could trigger public unease in Russia (people remember Afghanistan) so that means ground troops would need to be from the Syrian army and Iran and its militia allies. They no doubt have some fighters, but after all the years of war in Syria how much longer will they be willing to die for the glory of killing fellow Muslims? In the air Assad and Russia are clearly winning, but on the ground its a lot more difficult to tell how morale is holding up. Both sides could grind on, or one side or the other could run out of willing killers."

The value would be determined as a function of internally and externally generated propositions, as well as propositions implied from historical facts. I'm thinking about this because the Western alliance, in particular the United States, continues to take severe hits on the credibility front. • ""Proxy"" war no more. Allegations that the U.S. is now directly attacking Syrian troops (and effectively supporting ISIS in doing so). • Continued allegations that United States is supporting JFS terrorist group, which the U.S. refuses to renounce. • Allegations by Russia that it is the U.S. (only) that is keeping the text of the current ceasefire agreement secret (thus implying that there is some untoward intention contained within the agreement)"

So it makes sense to risk commitment to an early resolution especially in case of a bloody war . if it does not happen you have time To change the response! Aleppo is almost completely surrounded by Syrian army and allies The fight now is for the road in and out of that portion of the city held by terrorists and allies . russians and US are in talks , but putin knows the next president is coming soon In any case Russian interest is to defeat the armed opposition (terrorists) . Iran is committed to taking Aleppo Iranians endured their biggest loss of life and commanders around Aleppo even if warring parties and allies meet , Syrian governments wants more territory before serious talks . Add to that Recently some opposition groups reached agreements with Syrian goverment to vacate other cities . Let's hope it's done peacefully and soon , when it happens. The problem is al nusra and other terrorists allies , they are the most organized bunch ready to die and fight to the end. I cannot see them getting out of the city peacefully.

As the battle for Mosul proceeds the influx (or outflow depending on perspective ) of D'aesh could be the synergism for a tangle that will divert resources and attention on Aleppo which will/would likely be the capital of a Latkia centered rump state for Assad to claim as the New Syria.(Recent language used by Gov't speech writers for Assad have begun blurring the definition of Syria and stresses that the lines on a map do not adequately define the Nation of Syria, and begins to claim there is a Physical Syria and a Sphere of Syrian Influence and explaining that former Syrian Provinces serve as new buffer states). Its' all quite complicated, but a basic premise of holding Aleppo as the financial center of Syria seems part and parcel of the notional Rump State being created for Assad and it seems this new Governate will be promoted by the Russians as a way of creating a buffer for their Port."
