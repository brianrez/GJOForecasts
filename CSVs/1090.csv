The are 7 Governors, appointed to 14 year terms by the President of the US. In addition to the 7 governors, there are also 5 Federal Reserve appointments to fill out the 12 member FOMC. It is common to see the governors positions left empty, as it increses the influence of the US banks, who are limited to 5 seats For example, currently there are 5 bank representatives and 5 Presidential appointed governors. Depending on whether Congress approves Presidential nominees, or leaves the positions open, is an indication of Congressional preference for a. banking or b. Presidential influence on the FOMC."

Shelton is probably not a viable nomination. Waller, on the other hand, could make it through, although he would face a tough battle in maintaining his independence as a monetary policymaker in the face of Trump’s undisguised desire for a loyalist on the Board of Governors. https://whetstoneanalysis.com/2019/08/21/comment-dissents-in-the-fomc-vote-are-likely-to-continue-maybe-into-2020/"
