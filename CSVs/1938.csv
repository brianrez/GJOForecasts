They escalate tensions,” said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman. ”We have conveyed our concerns to Iran.” Brig. Gen. Ali Fadavi, the commander of the Revolutionary Guards’ naval forces, on Tuesday dismissed suggestions this Iranian vessels had come too close to American ones as “sheer lies,” according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency.

However, we have learned that some nuclear stocks and facilities were not in accordance with JCPOA limits on Implementation Day, but in anticipation the Joint Commission had earlier and secretly exempted them from the JCPOA limits. The exemptions and in one case, a loophole, involved the low enriched uranium (LEU) cap of 300 kilograms (kg), some of the near 20 percent LEU, the heavy water cap, and the number of large hot cells allowed to remain in Iran. One senior knowledgeable official stated that if the Joint Commission had not acted to create these exemptions, some of Iran’s nuclear facilities would not have been in compliance with the JCPOA by Implementation Day."

This compares to 41% who felt that way last September. A substantial majority of 66.1% believes that the US government is seeking other ways to maintain the negative affect of sanctions it actually lifted. According to the Iranpoll.com survey, which has a margin of error of +/- 3.2%, nearly three-fourths of Iranians (74.7%) believe that the United States is trying to prevent other countries from normalizing trade and economic relations with Iran despite lifting secondary sanctions. Such a negative view could boost the political fortunes of Iranian hard-liners who never supported the agreement and could undermine its major provisions over the next 10-15 years. Ebrahim Mohseni, a research associate at the Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland and one of the architects of the poll, told Al-Monitor in an email that ""Iranians were expecting a lot but feel that they have received nothing tangible in return for Iran's nuclear concessions."" Mohseni warned that ""unless Iranians see real economic gains from the nuclear deal, the nuclear agreement, those who negotiated it and the foreign policy approach that made it possible will all be in jeopardy as Iran's election season rhetoric heats up."""

Now What?': https://www.commentarymagazine.com/foreign-policy/middle-east/iran/iran-violates-deal-now/ Clip from Commentary article: 'In the months since the Iran nuclear deal went into effect, the Obama administration has acknowledged that the behavior of the Islamist regime hasn’t changed much. The Iranians continue to act as the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, test illegal ballistic missiles, threaten their neighbors, and seek regional hegemony while its leaders spewed hate at the West, the United States, and Israel. Indeed, in April, the president admitted that the Iranians were undermining “the spirit” of the pact while insisting that they were nonetheless observing the letter of the agreement. But it turns out his trust in the law-abiding nature of his negotiating partners was misplaced. A new report published by German intelligence that was backed up by a statement in the Bundestag by Chancellor Angela Merkel revealed that the Iranians have violated the letter of the deal via a clandestine effort to obtain “high-level” nuclear technology without permission from the United Nations Security Council.' Dropping 1 basis point."

Soleimani and his deputies have helped create, organize, fund, arm, and deploy the dangerous Shia militias that dominate the Popular Mobilization Forces, which was created in June 2014 after the Islamic State overran large areas of Iraq. And Soleimani, Qods Force and IRGC officers have been providing more than just advice to the Shia militias. Some of these militias, such as the Badr Brigade, Hezbollah Brigades and Asaib al Haq, were created during the US occupation of Iraq, and are responsible for killing hundreds of US troops. Others, like Harakat al Nujaba and Shahid al Shuhada, were created after the Syrian civil war escalated. Other militias, such as the Imam Ali Brigade and Saraya al Khorasani were created after the Islamic State ran roughshod over northern, central, and western Iraq. Each of these militias were modeled after Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia and organization that dominates inside Lebanon. The Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) is led by several agents of Iran. Abu Mahdi al Muhandis, a former commander in the Badr Organization who was listed by the US government as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist in July 2009, directs the PMF’s military operations. The US government described Muhandis, whose real name is Jamal Jaafar Mohammed, as “an advisor to Qassem Soleimani,” the commander of the Qods Force, the external operations wing of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). In addition to directing the PMF, Muhandis is also said to direct the operations of the Imam Ali Brigade as well as command Hezbollah Brigades."

On the one hand, opening an Embassy or consulate would be a powerful symbolic step for the Obama administration, and a signal that the administration's standing behind its signature foreign-policy achievement. On the other hand, as @Amir- points out the safety of the consulate is a key concern, particularly given the original reason for the break in diplomatic relations. Concern about the safety of diplomats has only been heightened as the death of Ambassador Christopher Stevens in Benghazi. The attack on the Saudi Embassy in Iran in January indicates that the Iranian government remains unable/unwilling to insure the safety of foreign diplomatic personnel, so it seems unlikely that the US Embassy or consulate were open in the near future. Additionally, remaining US sanctions would make it difficult for the US government to buy/rent property in Tehran or hire local contractors or employees. I suppose OFAC could grant the state department a waiver, but it seems likely that the remaining sanctions will need to go first, and that will depend on Congress."

Taking all this in I don't see Obama apologizing. I don't see Kerry apologizing either. Regardless it seems Rouhani is open to opening a US embassy soon. Before 18 Oct 2016??? I'm not so sure. The moderates did win the majority in Iran last week maybe an apology is not as important as it was two weeks ago.

What’s more, US-Iran normalization is not a realistic near-term prospect, Obama has said, even as he has ushered in historic shifts with Myanmar and Cuba.

My gut still says there is a chance a consulate or embassy will open but if this announcement is made there would be push back by congress. I use the Cuban Ambassador appointment as an example. Congress has blocked this appointment for some time now. I figure President Obama has his priorities for his last year in office and although an Iran Embassy is one of them its not at the top of the list. If sentiment towards Iran changes and becomes positive then perhaps an announcement will be made prior to October primarily to provide further evidence that Republicans are obstructionists.

Reagan was running for a second term and Iran Contra was only a whisper. Then I thought it a wonder that the ""News"" didn't cover the HOT portions of the Cold War. AIDS and ABORTION would soon dominate the nightly news but up to 1984 as Officials and News Orgs alike did pay greater attention and news room budgets were unconstrained by marketing and profit but rather driven by the obligation to inform as part of their agreements for FCC lis. Those back water Missions and Embassies were the over looked locus of a encirclement whereby we leveraged the enemies of Communism and SDI was no more than a Psyop to con Moscow into trying to keep up - and in the process bankrupt themselves."
