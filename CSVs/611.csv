The WaPo reports that next week's budget leaves out any mention of student debt cancellation.[1] My mistaken view was so strong based on my belief that Biden and his senior advisors had learned from Obama's failures of incrementalism. I think that view holds but the politics are just not in their favor with the 50/50 Senate and the intransigence from Manchin and Synema to stop minority-rule in the Senate. I did not give enough weight to their clearly enunciated views. When I did consider them, I engaged in hand waving to believe those two could be persuaded ""some how."""

This DOE is clearly disposed to cancel debt, having already cleared $1 billion for defrauded students at for-profit schools. The question is whether the DoJ’s Office of Legal Counsel is more likely than not to side with those who believe the executive branch has authority on its own to cancel student debt apart from the legislature. Executive branch lawyers tend to reflexively assert executive power. The acting head of OLC Christopher Schroeder was brought back in after serving in the OLC under Obama and Clinton. He was also a staffer for Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee. This suggests he can be relied upon to be friendly to the mainstream of respectable Democratic views on the law. I am guessing he will agree with all of those smart Harvard lawyers who say the president can cancel student debt on his own."

The odds of this executive order occurring on the stated timeline depend heavily on how stimulus negotiations go once Biden comes into office. Precedent from 2008, when Obama came in, suggests that a measure like a stimulus bill which is both good for the economy and something that the GOP could blame the Dems for, will not face stiff congressional opposition and it would not surprise me if this measure makes its way into the stimulus bill. However that itself depends on who controls the Senate since there is a difference between McConnell not vigorously opposing something and actively working towards it. Even if it doesn't get done in the stimulus, if the stimulus meets enough democratic priorities I suspect Biden will not feel pressured to use unilateral executive action on a measure that most policy wonks consider to be a band-aid solution and bad for the institution of the presidency."
