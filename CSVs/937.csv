Although Prime Minister Morrison was heavily criticized for how he handled the Australian bushfires earlier this year as he was not taking them seriously. And the polls showed the loss of popularity in him from that fiasco. Now with the Coronavirus epidemic and his countries response being one of the first countries to stop flights from China and calling it a pandemic even before the World Health Organization did. It seems as if Prime Minister Morrison is stepping up to the leadership role. He has actively addressed his nation many times asking them to stop hoarding materials and saying this is a once in a 100-year crisis and that Australians need to come together. Also, the fact that it isn’t an election year I find it extremely unlikely that they will hold a vote to remove him from office during this crucial time https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/04/has-australias-leader-learned-catastrophic-fires-coronavirus-is-test/ https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/14/the-biggest-poll-surprise-is-that-scott-morrisons-popularity-hasnt-taken-an-even-bigger-hit https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/australia/coronavirus-covid-19-update-australia-intl-hnk/index.html"

He had to lead the nation through bushfires in January and now has to deal with the new Corunavirus as well as the economic downturn that is a result of the fears for the virus. Prime Minister Morrison faced harsh criticism from Australians when he took a vacation to Hawaii while Australia was ravaged by horrible bushfires across the country. Also given the fact that there is going to be an economic downturn that is going to hit Australia particularly hard because of the coronavirus. It may seem unlikely that he will continue to be prime minister next year because it is difficult to get reelected if the economy is not doing well and the Hawaii vacation fiasco. However, in a recent poll reported on by The Guardian, his support has not taken a huge downturn as expected.

The news sources that I read discussed New Zealand’s Jacinda Arden’s anger towards the PM and his handling deportation in Australia. My second source discusses the ways in which PM Morrison has abused the process as being the one permanent member of the cabinet and seemingly covering up key decision-making process leading to further distrust between Morrison and his cabinet and the Australian people as a whole. This forecast will be 18% because I feel more inclined to increase the percentage as i have not seen PM Morrison have a change in pace with public opinion; public opinion is my main form of logic for developing this probability.
