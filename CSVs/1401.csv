Even if all the 26 Democratic seats were safe (which they are not), they would still need to take 2 seats from the 9 Republican incumbents. The Democrat's biggest opportunities are in Arizona and Nevada. In Arizona we will have to wait until the Republican primary on August 28th to see who will be running on the Republican side. In Nevada, the most recent polls show that Heller and Rosen have the same support and the rating Toss-up is correct. There are at the moment no signs that these states move significantly towards the Democrats. Simulations, based on the ratings by Cook, Sabato and Inside Elections (Safe=95%, Likely=85%, Lean=75%, Tilt+Toss up=50%) give a mean of 24 seats for the Democrats (a loss of 2), and a probability smaller than 1% of getting 28 seats or more.

Luke Messer (R-Ind.) released a new ad in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in Indiana criticizing state Rep. Mike Braun (R)'s voting record as a Democrat. Standing in front of a cardboard cutout of Braun, Messer says in the ad, ""Braun was a Democrat, even during the Obama years. ... I am who I say I am. I'm conservative. I support the president."" Braun voted in Democratic primaries for more than a decade, according to Dubois County records from 1996 through 2008, and a Republican National Committee voter database labeled Braun a ""Hard Democrat."" Braun voted in a Republican primary in 2012 and ran as a Republican for the state legislature in 2014. Braun spokesman Josh Kelley said in December, ""As is often the case in solidly blue counties, like Dubois was at the time, Mike cast his vote in competitive local primaries where it would have the greatest impact, while voting solidly Republican in general elections."" President Trump endorsed U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci (R) ahead of the May 8 Republican Senate primary. Renacci and businessman Mike Gibbons are vying for the GOP nod to take on incumbent Sherrod Brown (D) in the November general election. Brown is one of 10 Senate Democrats facing re-election in a state Trump won in 2016. Trump tweeted his endorsement of Renacci, citing his support for Trump’s preferred policies on taxes, immigration, and crime. Trump previously appeared at a rally for Renacci in February, and Vice President Mike Pence attended a forum with him in March. Renacci had been running in Ohio’s gubernatorial election, but he dropped out to run for Senate in January 2018 after State Treasurer Josh Mandel, who lost to Brown in 2012, withdrew from the race. Renacci said that the Trump administration convinced him to make the change. Renacci is favored to win the Republican primary. He was endorsed by Mandel, U.S. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Oh.), and all Republican members of the state’s U.S. House delegation. Election forecasters give Brown a slight edge in the general election, rating the seat as “Leans Democratic.” Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn is hitting the campaign trail for businessman Troy Downing in Montana’s U.S. Senate Republican primary. Downing’s campaign announced that Flynn would join him on April 24. Downing is in a four-way race to see who will take on incumbent Jon Tester (D) in November. Although he leads the race in fundraising due to his self funding, he has trailed State Auditor Matt Rosendale and former Judge Russ Fagg in recent polls. Tester is one of 10 Senate Democrats running for re-election in a state Donald Trump won in the 2016 presidential election. Flynn served as national security advisor from January to February 2017, resigning following reports that he did not provide Vice President Mike Pence with accurate information about a conversation that he had with a Russian ambassador concerning sanctions against the country. Prior to serving in the Trump administration, he worked on Trump’s presidential campaign and on his presidential transition team. In December 2017, Flynn pled guilty to making false statements to the FBI about his conversations with the ambassador. He agreed to cooperate with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election as part of his plea deal. April 24 was the filing deadline for candidates running in the U.S. Senate special election in Mississippi. The election will be a nonpartisan race on November 6, 2018, with a runoff on November 27, 2018, if no candidate receives a majority of the vote in the general election. The winner will replace Thad Cochran (R), who announced on March 5, 2018, that he would resign his seat on April 1, 2018, due to health concerns. Cindy Hyde-Smith was appointed by Gov. Phil Bryant (R) to fill the vacancy on March 21, 2018. Hyde-Smith is running for election to the seat along with four others: former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy (D), Mayor of Tupelo Jason Shelton (D), Mississippi State Senator Chris McDaniel (R), and Tobey Bartee. Candidates running for certain races in Florida must file by noon on May 4. Candidates will be filing for U.S. Senate, U.S. House, judicial offices, state attorney, and public defender. Candidates running for a state executive office, state legislative seat, or a county seat have until June 22 to file. Aside from those races, Florida has the 35th statewide filing deadline in 2018. In the U.S. Senate race, Senator Bill Nelson (D) is seeking re-election. There are also elections for Florida’s 27 members of the U.S. House of Representatives. Florida is currently represented by 11 Democrats and 16 Republicans. Senate is looking more competitive so lower my expectations of Republicans and hedging against the Blue Wave."

Possible outcomes (taking individual state probabilities from predictit.com and assuming the races are largely independent of each other (they are not, but the resulting error is probably modest): - Dems win all 6. This will bring them to 52 seats, as I assume they will also get Nevada. Probability: 3% - Dems win any 5. This gives them 51 seats. Probability: 15% - Dems win any 4, getting 50 seats.
