Though the Chinese economy did amazing well y/y in Q1 2021 (118.1) this was due to the large drop in Q1 2020. Even if growth were the same from Q1 to Q2 then the growth would still not be nearly as robust in y/y terms because the growth references the previous quarter in the previous year not the annualized growth for the year or the growth between quarters.

In terms of COVID cases they are seemingly doing pretty well. They have a competitive advantage, this due to the fact that they didn't shut down their economy for too long.

Based on that I'm increasing confidence in Q2 being over 8%. Comparing nominal GDP numbers to the index China has reported I'm estimating that inflation is low, which makes sense when coming out of a recession, so that shouldn't be subtracting from the nominal growth numbers too much. In a normal year Q2 is generally about 4.5% to 6.3% below the GDP of the previous Q4. Even if Q2 2021 is 6.3% below Q4 2020 the GDP for Q2 2021 would be 27.76 trillion yuan, which would be about 11% over the GDP for Q2 2020 of 25.01 trillion yuan. That's before inflation, so inflation would deduct a bit from that, but with fairly low inflation coming out of the recession it's hard to see inflation exceeding 3%."

The Chinese economy seems to have been doing fairly well especially with respect to other economies because more stringent (draconian) Chinese measures at halting the spread of COVID seem to have worked in some part. Nevertheless, the Chinese economy has two major issues waying it down which will keep the growth rate from being above 7.0% in my view. First, the large amount of privately held debt (as much as %188 of GDP per the IMF: https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PVD_LS@GDD/CHN). Second, the semi-export focus of the current Chinese economy and the desire by the regime to increase the ratio of domestic to foreign consumption of Chinese products (https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/voa-news-china/china-plans-lift-economy-boosting-consumption#:~:text=Consumption%20growth,manufacturing%2Doriented%20economy%20remain%20stable.) As domestic consumption can only grow slowly compared to growing export focus (growing domestic consumption requires growing internal wealth which takes time vs. selling exports to gain wealth from other countries' consumers which already have it). Thus, Chinese growth will be relatively strong, but not spectular compared to previous years (i.e., above 6% but below 8%)."

Thanks to @Econja2018 for helping me figure out how to get to the data (see the reply at the comment linked below). It's looking likely that nominal GDP could easily hit 7 or 8. Inflation reduces that though. But in recent years inflation has slowed in China, and I'm finding that in the last couple years inflation has been around 1 to 2%. So keeping that in mind I'm reducing confidence in the last two buckets a bit."

Initially I was thinking only of China's growth projections, which have been that growth is slowing down and make 5 to 6% the more likely target. But using Q2 of this year as the baseline makes it very easy to hit high growth next year. Will update in a few days once I've had a chance to do some more research."
