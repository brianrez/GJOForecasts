Parliament Speaker, Nabih Berri, set the seventh presidential session for next Thursday.Two thirds of the vote in the 128-seat parliament is needed for a candidate to win in the first round, with an absolute majority required in subsequent rounds.It was the second parliamentary session since the term of former president Michel Aoun ended in late October. It took 46 sessions, two and a half years and a series of political deals behind closed doors for Mr Aoun to be elected in 2016."
