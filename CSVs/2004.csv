UNHCR reports (http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php) that as of this forecast, about 344,600 refugees have arrived in 2016. If traffic were uniformly distributed across the year, then we should expect a total around 380,000 refugees this year. As it happens, I believe the total number is actually going to be closer to around 360,000. The 650,000 needed to make this true represents a tripling of the highest-traffic month of the crisis (221,000 in October 2015). This probability is vastly closer to 0 than to 1, but nothing is impossible and GJO requires integer forecasts :("

During the period of April 1-15, less than 8,000 migrants and refugees have arrived on Europe's shores. That's about half of what we saw last year during this same period[1]. As @Anneinak, @dkc, and @Milosz (as well as others) have pointed out, migrants and refugees are already seeking out other routes - especially Libya-Italy - in place of Turkey-Greece. But it is in no way clear that these alternative routes will support that average of 100,000 migrants and refugees/month for the rest of the year that would be necessary to reach 1,000,000 sea-borne arrivals that is the subject of this question. At the moment, the ""human smuggling infrastructure"" (I'm sorry, but I can't recall from whom I've borrowed that phrase) does not appear to be in place to move so many people. That might change in the long-run, but I have some doubts about it doing so before 2016 ends. All that said, caution is warranted. Most of the inflow of migrants and refugees to Europe occurs during the last 4 months of the year. So there's a very real possibility of reaching a million, but right now I don't think that possibility can be much more than 2-to-1 against."

Let's assume that the fall in the number of arrivals is really a result of political changes and not just changes in the weather or in other conditions that would cause a sharp but temporary lessening of the flow of refugees and migrants.

The summer will be an important test of whether the inflow or outflow will respectively increase or decrease.

The EU TURKEY - deal? The EU reluctantly coming to the table with Turkey to stem the refugee waves seems to have yielded some results after tough negotiations: It now has the right to send the refugees back to Turkey and also has been promised an increase in border security measures by Turkey.In turn, Turkey has been promised 6 billion euros (roughly $6.8 billion) of financial aid for the refugees in the country, visa exemptions for Turks after a set of criteria are fulfilled and the launch of a new chapter to reanimate the EU membership process. Turkey has until April to comply with 72 different criteria in order to obtain the visa exemption for the European Union. ""There is also a stipulation on establishing an independent commission on monitoring human rights violations by the security forces. There are many criteria. Turkey will be labeled a democratic country if it can implement all of them. Europe for the time being seems to go along with the negotiations, although it knows that these criteria will not be met.” He added, “The implementation process will be evaluated after the agreement is signed and it will become clear in June 2016 that it will not happen."" Meanwhile, objections are already being heard from Europe. Frans Timmermans, the vice president of the European Commission, said that the visa exemption for Turkey depends on the requirements and that there is no ""shortcut"" for this. Timmermans, noting that the visa exemption will not be easy to accomplish, also said the requirements must be met by April. The negotiation of the readmission agreement, which is jointly discussed with Turkey’s visa exemption for the EU, is not a new idea. Turkey, upon signing the agreement, promises to take back the refugees who originated from the east of Turkey and migrated to Europe. However, experts again warn there might be legal disputes with this agreement. Turkey being a signatory of the 1957 Geneva Convention and the added protocol of 1967 does not recognize asylum seekers as refugees. The refugees in the country are only accepted as “guests.” Here we can talk about an extended protection exclusive to the Syrian refugees but no one has full refugee status. This may lead to a debate on Turkey not meeting the directives of the European Parliament on readmission of refugees in a “safe third country.”"

Also increasingly migrants will be returned back to the countries they departed from, such agreements are already being made.

The costs and risks of trying to enter Europe illegally will increase which will also severly curtail numbers who try. It is possible that other countries will become focus of economic migrants.

On the one had, the decline from January to February and from February to March suggests that we're riding a function that will get asymptotically close to zero as the summer months approach. If that happens, then - of course - there won't be anything close to 1 million refugees and migrants entering Europe this year. On the other hand, two factors push toward the opposite conclusion. First, the number of refugees and migrants tends to increase sharply as we get closer to the second half of the year because of the better weather. Second, there have already been more than 161,000 refugees and migrants in 2016, 8 times as many as the 22,000 at the end of March in 2015[d]."

This (repellent, I think) change in policy could significantly affect the outcome of this question. It remains to be seen how much of this human traffic can be interdicted or disincentivized. But it does appear that *a lot* of refugees and migrants are entering the EU by sailing from the west coast of Turkey to Greek islands like Chios, Lesvos, Samos, Leros, and Kos[2]. Unless I'm misreading the data, that's about 129,000 folks already in 2016. Reducing the percentage of refugees and migrants who enter the EU this way would have a disproportionately large affect on the the aggregate number of refugees and migrants entering the EU in 2016, making the likelihood that the number of refugees and migrants will be over 1,000,00 this year lower.

It barely made 1 million refugees by sea. Numbers may pick up during summer months, but right now we're still on a downward trend from last October. Beyond European nations closing borders or threatening to do so, word may be getting back to Syria that immigrants still don't have jobs in spite of Germany's welcoming rhetoric. There are only two reasons for all those unmarried young men to emigrate to Europe: jobs and evading conscription. Migrants from Afghanistan or Iraq are less welcome and may still be stuck in camps. Between growing dissatisfaction in Europe, growing disillusionment among refugees and migrants, Turkey's attempts to extort concessions, and Greece being fed up, the flow of refugees and migrants may be headed downward for a long stretch."

Need to figure out the syrian refugee count over time to get a good sea/land split. However, also need to consider migrant sources that could increase the number to one million even if the syrian sea-based refugee number goes down."

Recent reports like the mass sexual assaults in Germany on new year's eve, or the murder of a shelter worker by a refugee this week, will continue to erode public support.

16062,2016-01-20T05:17:16Z,1,[85.0],[85.0],"Current European policy settings are not effective at preventing or deterring migrants from attempting to enter Europe. While there are signs of hardening rhetoric in Germany, whose policies (and whose Chancellor's statements) have served as the biggest magnet, rhetoric alone will not stop people coming. There is a big gap between tough talk and actively closing the doors - and the lure of a better life is stronger than any deterrents on the horizon. It is also worth bearing in mind that migration often has a lag time, with individuals needing to make arrangements, sell their possessions, arrange passage with smugglers and undertake the journey. Moreover, many of those who have successfully made the journey in 2015 will act as anchors and will project confidence to friends and family members in their communities back home, encouraging these people will seek to emulate that journey. So long as the passage from Turkey to Greece and from North Africa to Italy remains effectively open, the numbers attempting the journey are likely to be even higher in 2016 than in 2015. Even in the unlikely event of an effective ceasefire occurring in Syria in 2016 (which I assess at an approximately 10% chance), migrants from a number of other source countries/regions, not least West Africa, are still likely to make the journey, if primarily for (perfectly understandable) economic and lifestyle reasons. The rise of anti-migration and right-wing parties offers some risk to this prediction but not in the short term and only in respect of some countries, not to the point of preventing migration to Europe as a whole."

Some points/facts (non-cited as known): · In 2015, 1.01 million refugees came into Europe by sea. · The peak month was October with 231k and slowly tapering off to below 100k. · Markel’s poor policy is the main impedes and she has not changed here stance. · Most are coming from via (thus the Arab’s), far less from North Africa · Turkey still has around 1.5 to 2 million refugees. Many may want to attempt to make it to Europe. · Turkey received several billions to “keep” and “prevent” sailings to Greece. Sadly, little action has been seen thus far. · Sweden closed it borders as well as Denmark. · Germany is discussing limiting to 200 k/a, something in this direction will happen, especially after the events in Cologne. · Lastly, for 1 million to be breached we need 83k/m. What are the odds? Some opinions: 1. To me Europe, the EU and the people are slowly getting sick of this issue and will try to do as much as possible to limit the influx. How, is much disputed, but without action the right-wing populist will win more seats and force action. With the “good times” over, as at least in Germany the life of a typical refugee is not all that prosperous as maybe thought, the economically motived refugees should become less. Why spend 10k€ on travels to get 120€/m pocket money? 2. Woman and children. Officially 58% were men, but likely it was more, meaning there extended family, once granted asylum are likely to follow. 1 wife and 3-5 kids per man = 2.9 million potential entries…but the key thing is, they will likely be flown in, if they are allowed in. In Germany, it take between 6-24 months to have the status approved, meaning very few families will be transferred in 2016, thus voiding this aspect in light of the GJOpen question 3. Turkey as a Nato nation, aspiring EU nation and Germany is their main trading partner, pressure to keep there word will be mounting. They most slow down the influx, if only by 50% it still is significant. 4. Weather, winter has not yet truly hit Europe allowing more than typical /expected entrees in Q4-2015. Should a harsh Q1-2016 winter hit, it will slow movement and allow governments to prepare for the rest of the year All-in-all: Maintaining 83k/m is unlikely. Yet, as long as Merkel maintains a “welcome” policy many will be motived. Let us consider that all the 1.7 million in Turkey plus another million from nieghbouring countries will join, plus 0.2 from North Africa. Total: 2.9 million. Now, I have listed 6 major points why it should be throttled. Thus for simplistic and to come to a number 2,9/6 = 483k / 1000k = 2,06 (or 24%) half it = 12%"

Unfortunately, motivations to flee from the region-at-large will unlikely subside this year. However, I predict Syria's contribution to the 'by sea' numbers will decrease this year. And unless another single country contributes nearly 500,000 refugees in 2016, OR there is a sharp uptick in the sum of multiple not-Syrian refugees, I don't see this 1M threshold being crossed again. Second, I predict at the behest of EU and UN leaders, broader international support will unfold; even small levels of aid from around the world will absorb a significant a portion of the Mediterranean traffic, and I expect these mechanisms will be greased before 3Q (warmer) months. We can hope (I know, that's not a prediction) that West Africa (now Ebola free) will aid in taking in North African IDPs and the same from the GCC states. TBD."

Numbers have reduced in the last two months, although totals at this level continued would reach the 1m mark - the recent reduction can likely be explained in some part due to winter weather and would expect a spike in the spring.
