Last year sales were 531K October to December, which would project to 1.403M if sales are the same, or 1509 in last quarter sales were up 20% over last year (per early 2019 tracking). August and September 2019 sales were down 15.8% and 34.2% over 2018, so if we project a drop, year over year, of about 20% through December, we get to about 1.14M in sales.

In order to catch up with 2018, Chinese NEVs market needs a total sale of 0.31 million (and a monthly average sale of 0.155 million) during 2019/11-2019/12, 5) As mentioned in 1), 2) and 3), and we knew that monthly sale of NEVs in Chinese market in 2019/10 is 0.75. If 4) truly can happen, we shall see a dramaticly increase in monthly sale during 2019/11-2019/12. Given latest inventory condition and subsidy policy will stop by the end of 2019, I gave 95% to first slot. 6) However, Chinese car dealer may need to meet their own sales goal by the end of 2019, which means they may give bigger discount on price of NEVs. Therefore, I gave 5% to second slot. 7) Btw, I saw someone mentioned that Chinese customers are waiting for Telsa Model 3 from Shanghai factory. Well, I read news that Model 3 from Shanghai factory will have lower settings compared to import version (no steering wheel heating and no PM 2.5 filter), and a slightly cheaper price (8,1000 CNY, or 1,153 USD cheaper). Therefore, I don't see how Model 3 from Shanghai factory can boost up the Chinese NEVs market heavily in next 1.5 months (if they can be delivered)."

Some 1.03 million NEVs were sold in China in the first 11 months of the year, up 68% from the same period in 2017, according to CAAM data."" [2] ""In [all of] 2018, 1.26 million units of NEVs were sold, up 61.7 percent year-on-year, the first time the important one-million-unit milestone was surpassed, data from the CAAM showed on Monday. CAAM forecasts NEV sales of 1.6 million units in 2019."" [3] ""In the first half of 2018, NEV sales doubled from the year before with a 106% increase, and saw a 68% increase in the second half of 2018, according to data from research house EV-Volumes."" [4] - ""That’s thanks to China’s continuous support for NEVs, which includes government subsidies and license plate controls on diesel cars."" [2] Apparently, subsidies will stop at the end of 2020, and have been ""on a stepped decline since 2016. Although the new policy for 2019 has not been announced, speculation has widely circulated online that national subsidies will be reduced by 50 percent based on 2018 levels, and local ones will be canceled entirely."" [3] - ""In January 2019, the surge in NEV sales continued in China, with a 300% increase from the previous year, which unfortunately was not echoed in the following month of February."" [4] In 2019, ""the NEV market in China may not be as bullish as previous years, with the Chinese government raising subsidies for new electric vehicle purchases this year from only vehicles with a range above 150km to 250km and halving subsidies for longer range NEVs. [...] Still, NEV volume in China is predicted to reach 1.8 million units by the end of 2019, 3% lower than the previous year but increasing the overall NEV market share by 55% to 6.7%."" [4] - ""Sales of electric vehicles, by contrast, are growing exponentially. CAAM said that total new energy vehicle (NEV) sales rose 85.4 per cent in March to 126,000 units. For the first quarter, total NEV sales doubled, to 299,000 units, year-on-year."" [5]"

Despite a strong start to 2018, overall sales of passenger vehicles dropped by 4.1% over the 12 months, dragged down in part by a weaker yuan and the withdrawal of a tax break in late 2017. Sales of electric cars motored ahead, however, accounting for 4% of vehicle sales. The government wants this to reach 20% by 2025"
