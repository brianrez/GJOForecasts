Further, the 3D aspect may boost its relative performance to Dr. Strange 2 and Black Panther 2, which are not necessarily made with 3D as a significant element in the moviegoing experience. You also have the advantage of Avatar 2 premiering in a month that typically have high grossing movies, and you have the advantage of it being a relatively more family friendly appeal compared to the horror vibes in Dr. Strange 2 and the somber vibes in Black Panther 2.I also think in your first sentence, this realization should cause you to maintain your 3rd forecast at the minimum, not fall back to the lower-value bins. I would have adjusted ever so slightly closer to the estimates of those using the ""wrong prior"" as opposed to against it. To forecast bin 2 would say Avatar 2 is going to underperform Dr. Strange 2 and Black Panther 2 by at least 18%."

From what I recall with the 2009 film, we all went to see it not because the story was amazing (lots of folks said it was just a ripoff of FernGully, Pocahontas or Last of the Mohicans) but because the visuals were stunning - it was one of the first big 3D IMAX movies that really made that technology worth it. I'm not sure there is a similar technology change to justify this and the chance of a sequel having a better story than the original is pretty low (Empire Strikes Back, Godfather II, Mad Max... anything else?)"
