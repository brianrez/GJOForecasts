Rights of the Provinces, taxation and sobriety testing are major issues still on the table. Passing a bill in Canada is painfully slow compared to the US. The issues that still need to be ironed out before recreational legalization are significant, and Uruguay is the only example of a country with full legalization, and the countries are obviously dissimilar. I predict Canada will legalize recreational marijuana and leave the details to the Provinces. I also predict the bill will not pass before October 1, 2017."

Decriminalisation is also unlikely but some are arguing that this would be a sensible stepping stone to take before full legalisation. So I put that at 20%.

If Trudeau's government can find common ground with the provinces on these critical issues, it might be able to forge ahead -- otherwise, there will likely be a fight with the provinces when it comes to how to do it.

A major sticking point is likely to be the issue of global treaties which may need to be amended to accommodate the new legislation. based on this, the risks to the timescale appear to biased toward overrunning the Oct 1st Deadline."

Washington state is on track to bring in $1bil US in marijuana taxes in 2016 (per NPR radio Washington State), and Alaska is set to reap much needed revenue from recreational marijuana taxes in 2017 amid low oil prices. Alberta would benefit equally from marijuana taxes in Calgary and Edmonton amid low oil prices and even places like Saskatchewan that are feeling a deep hangover from the Chinese potash buying boom of pre-2008 will have a pull to legalize and tax. Outside the most conservative smaller communities, marijuana simply isn't that big a deal among people under 40 in N America. But things like getting tax relief among hard economic times and lessening the revenue fueling cartel violence associated with wars for illegal drug smuggling routes and markets are big deals."

The government has already changed its tune on proportional representation, a far more popular measure. Full legalization is unlikely, as the government needs to keep middle swing voters. However further decriminalization and regulation is likely, and already a trend at many provincial and municipal levels. On an operational level even some departments such as Vancouver police department don't enforce marijuana law, and even federal police don't raid known growing operations except when there is a threat to life. This trend is likely to continue. As Canada is not the kind of Country to ever fully legalize anything it's also unlikely, e.g. prohibition era alcohol laws still being in effect in some parts of Canada, but alcohol is legally purchasable through government agencies such as the BC Liquor Distribution Branch with few restrictions. While weed is culturally widely accepted, Canada tends to prefer to keep things highly regulated."

Say the bill is proposed in April (maybe the 20th?), that only give 6 months for the two houses of the Canadian legislative branch to agree on everything in the bill. The Lower House (House of Commons) is very heavily Liberal, the same party as PM Justin Tredeau, (as seen here: http://www.parl.gc.ca/parliamentarians/en/partystandings) however, the Senate is lead by the Conservative party (as seen here: http://www.parl.gc.ca/SenatorsBio/standings_senate.aspx?Language=E). For a bill so controversial and complex as controlling who will have access to pot, how to control the access, how to tax, how to regulate, how to treat people charged with pot crimes in the pas and a enormous litany of other issues, I suspect that the bill may pass (as the popular support seems to be very heavily in favor of) but it will take longer than 6 months to hash out all the details. Another possibility that could arise is that the bill is postponed entirely in order to let smaller, controlled areas test out the ramifications of legalization per the advice of Anne McLellan, leader of the federal task force on how to legalize pot (seen here: https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/09/12/go-slow-says-leader-of-task-force-on-legalization-of-pot-in-canada.html).

On a two party preferred, these numbers convert to 56±14% in favour and 44±11% against. If it is assumed that the statistical proportion of undecided turn against legalization and this reflects in the Senate vote – the house of review, largely independent that can reject the legislation - may result in a maximum of 45 to 49% against legalization indicating the vote is almost certainly in favour – I give this a 95% probability. The timing is a different issue: ignoring opposition to the legalization of weed, there are a number of complications such as international treaties that the Canadian Parliament must review if it is going to introduce a coherent legislation. It is said the legislation will be introduced in the spring of 2017 but the question is if it will be approved at the time or delayed until all the other issues are resolved.
