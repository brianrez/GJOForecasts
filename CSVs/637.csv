98033,2021-03-19T03:18:19Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],"To make this prediction, I had to break this down into at least two questions. What factors are causing the Amazon to burn so much, and will those factors increase or decrease within the next year? What has been the rising fire trend in these forests? For the first question, I found a helpful site: https://earthsky.org/earth/amazon-rainforest-fires-burning-4-reasons-why. Here, they list 3, not 4 (as advertised in the title) main reasons why it is burning. Increased farming in the rainforest, which causes deforestation, infrastructure development and deforestation due to silence on the part of Bolsonaro, and road choked streams. These factors are only going to increase, due to the growing population of Brazil, Bolsonaro’s unwillingness to spend money on saving the environment and using it for his benefit, and increasing infrastructure including roads. Segments of forests that have burned already, constitute only a small fraction of the total acreage of Amazonian rainforests, therefore there is still a lot more that could burn in the fire season (June-November) of next year. The second question was answered by https://www.globalfiredata.org/updates.html, which has month to month fire data. DUe to raising trends in deforestation which has a direct correlation to fires, I predict that 2021 will have an increased chance of meeting and or exceeding the 2020 fire count. Chance of meeting the 2020 fire count: 100%. Chance of exceeding the fire count: 50%. = 75% chance."

This, coupled with the correlation made (in an article posted May 22nd on the same website below) to the rise in fires with the rise in ocean temperatures, that is likely to continue to increase with global warming, makes me believe the number and intensity of fires in 2021 should increase. Without significant advocacy or enforceable governmental restriction, I don't see this changing, and potentially exceeding 2005 numbers (when the El' Nino drought caused significant increases in fires). Interestingly, the pattern of droughts in the rainforest has occurred in 2005, 2010, and 2015/16, which puts the course for additional drought activity patterned for 2020/21. Research has found that ""... when two areas in the Atlantic Ocean which are situated north and south of each other start to go out of phase – that is when temperatures are rising in one, but decreasing in the other – the Amazon is likely to experience a severe drought within 1-1.5 years."" (from TiPES article #2). Furthermore, as noted in an EcoWatch study, ""Faced with the effects of climate change, there is a risk that the Northern Hemisphere will heat up faster than the South, which would stimulate the occurrence of the Atlantic dipole and lead to a more intense frequency of droughts in the Amazon."" (See EcoWatch article #3). This provides a general rationale for the general shift in unfavorable forces that can lead to greater potential for drought and continued increase in the future Amazonian fire risk."

The linear trend is not statistically significant at a 0.05 level (and I have a prior belief that the linear trend shouldn't be large, even if it's there) and the early 2000s data looks unrepresentative, so I give them lower weights (1/4 each) in a geometric mean. This gives about %20.77, rounded up to %21."

In addition to that, the increased deforestation has led to worse outcomes for the forest overall; Increased development and deforestation has contributed an increasing number of fires over time. Lastly, La Nina may make the fires particularly worse than 2020. “Cooling of the eastern Pacific due to the developing La Niña will likely result in drier and warmer-than-normal conditions from western Colombia, Ecuador and Peru,” said Nicholls, AccuWeather's lead international forecaster. “Drought conditions can develop in these areas.” This confluence of factors leads to the likelihood that the total fire activity in the Amazon in 2021 will exceed 2020."

A possible early abort of the Bolsonaro regime due to mounting domestic pressure, perhaps. /International pressure from governments, supranational organizations and NGOs may be more urgent in 2020/21, after this year's experience. Bolsonaro himself will laugh at it, but it remains to be seen, how long. Brazilians appear to begin realizing that the current government has a focus only for its self-interest, the military and the secret rulers of the nation, the agrarian-industrial super-rich. As soon as the devastation of the livelihoods of regular people by increased deforestation and land grabbing becomes more obvious, Brazil's economic turmoil may spark a revolt against the ruling of old boys clubs and corruption that lies behind deforestation, comparable to Chile or Peru. /The EU-Mercosur trade agreements will be bound to environmental standards. https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/eu-mercosur-association-agreement/ So far, an increasing number of MEPs oppose the TA and prevent its signature. https://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/ende-mercosur-abkommen-101.html https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/brasilien-amazonas-braende-105.html With the speculation for an increased demand for Brazilian soy bean and beef products from the European market gone, there is no need for more cultivable land, to the contrary, more acreage would mean over-supply and falling prices."

However the q is will total fire be more, so it only needs to be +1 from this year. Right now our total is 7420 and if we imagine it rises to closer to 7500 we only see 5 years since 2003 eclipsing that total and only 2 since 2010. Because our jumps are not uniform or consistent in anyway I can see, it makes more sense to look at totals. Therefore it would be improbable for it to hit over 7500 for 2021 as that only happened 5 times in 18 years or 28% (Baseline?).
