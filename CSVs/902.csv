How would you judge the probability of a famine occuring in either South Sudan, Yemen or Sudan in 2020? Right now I think that P(SS or Y or S) would be somewhere between 60-80% (I'd have to think harder to narrow it down). But now, what's the P(SS and Y and S)? My rough estimate would be 15-35%. Then P(SS and Y and S and Nigeria) would be 1-10%. If we trust FEWS and I do then P(E or K or S or T or U) would be lower than the event I previously mentioned. Besides, how many famines can occur in a year? I guess it would take much more than the present conditions for this to happen. It will be bad, probably worse than year before. Locust will do damage, there will be many people suffering but I feel that a forecast of a famine for this region this year seems like believing a story of some kind of apocalypse (""of biblical proportion"") and it might be caused by biased views of Africa caused by the news. I hope and believe they will handle this year's crisis well. As for now I stick with the base rates, disregard premature warnings from the news and the crowd and choose to be optimistic with this question. Also, there have been some important good news this year about the weather which is crucial to the matter. And I don't see any threat of a man-made disaster this year in these countries. “At the end of the day,” Funk says, “humanitarian crises are caused by humans.” An interesting article - https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/how-team-scientists-studying-drought-helped-build-world-s-leading-famine-prediction If FEWS moves their forecast up I will follow, if someone has arguments against my opinion I'd be glad to hear them."

The impact of COVID-19 on resources available to aid these countries is unclear, but as COVID-19 presents itself as a global issue it is important to note. However, the implications of a famine declaration will likely push resources up for these countries. (1) - 25% Locusts: The current issue at hand is the locusts in East Africa. Efforts to control the locusts have not worked and major food assistance will be likely needed as conditions that make a famine become more true to the case at hand. (2) Congruently, this is occurring at the beginning of the crop season and will have numerous effects moving forward for many of the countries affected. (3) 50% Famine Conditions: Looking deeper into the dispersion of locusts across already at-risk areas such as South Sudan, Ethiopia, and parts of Kenya, the spread and increase of locust is increasing on an upward trend. (4) 70% Weather: East Africa has seen a drought for quite some time causing the deaths of many people and many people, animals, and crops. This factor alone is determinate of food shortage for quite some time and will need a large amount of improvement to decrease the already increasing food insecurity in the region. (5) 80%"

Not clear what the impact on relief agencies and NGO's covid-19 will have, but operations globally may be impaired. The landing page at https://fews.net/ shows that the listed countries are in Stressed or Crisis conditions, but not yet at famine level. None of the countries are on the Areas of Highest Concern list. Somalia and Ethiopia appear to be most at risk. Weather is likely the biggest factor going forward."
