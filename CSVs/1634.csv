According to the site Tesla has sold 345 vehicles last. It is however hard to assign value to this as I struggle in understanding if this is the number of cars the company has delivered and thus has received full payment for? Assuming so the numbers then fall within my recent model. Thus I assign more percentile points to the lower bracket of < 50 000. https://insideevs.com/global-insights-electric-car-race-automakers-companies/

Their goal is to reach 5000/wk of Model 3 cars by the end of this year with a goal of 10,000/wk by Dec 2018. Based on Elon Musk's description of anticipated production ""hell"", I believe Tesla will experience difficulty rapidly reaching its target and that the first production cars won't leave the factory until Oct. Tesla just borrowed $1.5 b in debt (grade B-) as a cash cushion and has apparently structured these bonds to allow for repayment potentially after the first cars are sold. This will buy the company more time and allow it to slowly ramp up production while troubleshooting unanticipated delays. Incidentally, Tesla reports that there is a waiting list of over 400,000 buyers."

I am sure they will be adjusting the vehicle quarter per quarter as they see how the Model 3 works in the wild. The higher end of 200,000 is a great target and on I believe they feel confident in ramping up to. With 400,000 deposits in hand, they can generate a great first two years of growing production volume, while they build on that number."

On the other hand the questions closes end of June next year and there I could easily see Tesla delivering 200k+ cars.
