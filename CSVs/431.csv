It’s a bit confusing, but if I read the report right, the Sept numbers were affected by Auckland being in lockdown. Trends are up nationally and quite sharply. So if Auckland lockdown is the biggest impact in the sept reduction (as house prices in Auckland are higher than the rest of the country) then we might see a big jump in Oct back to Aug plus any increase in Auckland prices which would take us right to the question threshold.

Some happen immediately and some complete their sale a set date some time in the future, all could impact on December house values. Another big thing to consider: when does the sale price come into the report? when it goes unconditional or when it is settled? If it is at settlement then presumably even if Auckland opens up in December and a sales boom follows the sales won't be completed until January or later? What do you think @oracle100 ?"
