And, there will likely be fewer vaccines given over Memorial Day weekend, both because doses given are declining and because fewer people will likely get vaccinated over the holiday. However, to what extent fewer people get vaccinated over the holiday won't be known until the forecast is closed, as the full extent doesn't show up for 2 days, based on previous holidays. I will guess that maybe 0.6M to 0.8M fewer people than expected will be vaccinated this long weekend. Even if 0.5M fewer than expected don't get vaccinated, just from the daily decline alone, I think the final number will probably go <170M. My current best guess is that the final number will be between 169.0M and 170.0M. @CJH, I don't think it's likely that the forecast will end up >170M."

Again, the question is what will happen on Memorial Day weekend. Suppose Wed. through Friday add 0.86M/day, and that the 3 back reporting days add 0.8M/day. That brings us to 169.4M. So Memorial Day weekend vaccination rates would have to be almost zero to stay under 170M. So I think it's time to update, @CJH. Many in the crowd don't add 3 back reporting days; we saw this in the forecasts in the last round that were close to a forecast bin limit. I wonder whether the crowd so strongly favors <170M in part because of this. But it's clear today (and I should have realized before) that >170M is very likely. It's still possible that vaccination rates could fall off over the next 3 days, so this should be watched closely. Update: I adjusted to 45%/55% because of the uncertainty over declining rates over the next few days. And I see your forecast isn't too different from that!"
