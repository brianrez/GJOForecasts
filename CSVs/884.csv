So a lot depends on the market conditions and long-term contracts for these materials (probably precious/rare metals, among others) and mass production by just a handful of companies (Samsung, Panasonic, LG,...), and on the other hand R&D in material science to probably find structures and molecules that behave like the classical electrode material but are much cheaper, and possibly bring along some functional improvement or with regards to charge duration, total capacity, number of life cycles, safety, easier processable. Noting the plans and targets of Tesla as announced on their battery day 2020 have become more cautious when it comes to ambitions on the field of time frame and price, then Tesla Inc. which for the time being have a partnership with contractors but are planning a battery manufacturing of their own could achieve a price of maybe 135 USD/kWh and reduce the price to 95USD/kWh in 2022 - the potential of cost cuts in Li-ion technology is not unlimited. As the question asks for ""the industry-wide average cost of battery packs"", my forecast takes account of proximity to the boundary of 100USD between the bins 2 and 3 on the one hand, and on the other hand of the uncertainty about the question, whether Tesla will be successful in the attempt to transform itself from a ""battery pack consuming"" car manufacturer into a self-serving battery pack producer, and whether its cost then lie under, at or above industry-wide average prices. One thing is clear, as the importance of EVs for the (European and worldwide) car manufacturers has increased dramatically and seem to determine their fate over the next decade, battery pack production has more than ever turned into a cut-throat competition, which will make the industry-wide average price(s) fall and adapt rather fast than slowly, as production capacity will spike in 2021."
