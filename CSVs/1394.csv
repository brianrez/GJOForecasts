In the case of IpsosMRBI and B&A there were decent undecided portions (17% and 19% respectively). I've seen reports suggesting that the undecideds are more likely to break yes, which rings true for me based on the peel away from outright Yes voters we've seen in the Ipsos polling (most likely to go Yes -> Undecided, rather than Yes -> No directly). It's also possible that in a country that is traditionally conservative on abortion yes might be the tougher answer to give to a pollster. Only Ipsos showing a real closing in the polls, although that is a contra-indication there is still a sufficient gap (12pts) for me to think that in light of other polling, No won't make it in time. http://www.thejournal.ie/abortion-poll-red-c-sunday-business-post-4023304-May2018/ https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/urban-surge-set-to-carry-the-day-for-eighth-amendent-repeal-polls-show-j070rgdnk"

It seems to be unknown if the campaigns by outside (presumed US) groups that Youtube and Facebook are now making some attempt to block have affected Irish opinion.

The purpose of having any any policy written into a constitution is to prevent law makers easily changing laws in that area. It appears from opinion polls that most Irish voters think that there are circumstance where abortion should be permitted and there are circumstances where most think it should not be permitted. As has been pointed out there is considerable disagreement between voters as to what these circumstances should be. It would be reasonable to speculate that the opinions of voters would vary over time as different circumstances get fuller discussion and that science presents new facts. It is surely impossible to expect a constitution to be able to define all circumstances, which is why democracies have legislators who pass laws that fit the circumstances and the needs of the time and can be changed to fit the circumstances and needs of tomorrow or next year. Removing the Eighth Amendment would not be a vote for a free for all over abortion, but a vote to allow legislators to adapt to needs. If voters really do not trust politicians to make good laws, it difficult to hold out much hope for democracy, they might as well hand over government to a dictator or require a referendum on every law. It appears that in the last twenty years or so Irish citizens have become more confident that they have a right (and duty) to vote for representatives that will carry out the people's wishes rather than as happened in the past, the citizen was expected to be constrained and directed by higher authorities. So I expect the Eighth Amendment will be repealed so that free discussion on what abortion legislation is appropriate, can take place."

With Fine Gael, probably a bit more socially liberal than Fianna Fáil on this issue there is a chance it may be repealed or altered, but both parties have been ambiguous concerning a solid stance on the subject of abortion with supporters and detractors on both sides and a strong Irish Catholic influence. The referendum on gay marriage inspires hope that they will be more progressive on this issue, but in places like Roscommon the vote was very close, and the country is looking at a deep divide on the issue between what could be considered the old guard and the newer generations that see abortion as a reproductive right. While same sex marriage was a close call in Roscommon, it was not so close nationally and same sex marriage won. This cannot be used as an exact barometer of how the vote will go concerning abortion as this is a more emotionally charged issue driven by religious morality vs. more modern scientific definitions of reproduction and life."

The referendum on the amendment will be held in late May. The people will be asked whether they want to delete the Eighth Amendment and replace it with new wording stating “that provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy”. Polls show a majority of Irish voters - 56% - want abortion legalized. When undecided voters are excluded, 65 per cent favour repeal and abortion being allowed up to 12 weeks while 35 per cent do not. https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/clear-majority-backs-abortion-on-request-up-to-12-weeks-poll-shows-1.3368816. With the availability of the pill, the question of abortion is becoming less relevant, but the idea of Ireland being a backward outpost in the civilized community of European nations drives the younger voters to ban the eighth."
