The fraction (cumulative deaths)/(cumulative cases) for China is 3.74%. When we give this percentage a range between 2% and 4% the cumulative number of deaths on June 1st should be between 4,952 and 9,904 with a mean of 7,428.

This would mean over 12,000 by 1st June. Keeping to 5,500 would mean the rate reducing (quickly) to 25/day, which seems a stretch unless there is a sudden breakthrough, but even then deaths through secondary complication would still mean attribution of primary cause of death to Covid-19.

So far 3069 people have died, and 6% of 41,151 = 2469.06, giving a total of 5538 within the current sample. Meanwhile the number of cases outside China is accelerating with major outbreaks expected across Europe and confirmed numbers from Iran and the US just beginning their upward trajectory."

If this is the case, (a) the average mortality rate might turn out to be much lower than the currently estimated 2.3-2.5% but (b) the number of people who will catch the new virus will be much higher. 2. China is a developed country and much more regimented than most countries. Still, it spread rapidly and proved critical in about 4.5% of confirmed cases in the space of a month. It's unlikely that enough people will self-quarantine and follow religiously basic rules of hygiene in other countries, especially those where soap and clean water are not readily available. So, the virus will continue to spread and it's already affected over 50 countries around the world. 3. Some people who were infected, isolated, treated and given the all-clear have re-tested positive for the virus. This may be a statistical artefact or may have to do with flawed tests (e.g. false negatives, mistakes medical/lab staff may have made because of exhaustion), but it may also be a sign that either the virus is already mutating to a different (more/less lethal?) strain or that surviving the infection does not confer immunity for some other reason."

The numbers don't grow in a recognisable pattern. If you plot the daily change in the number of fatalities, you get a zigzag shape. But the number of people who die doesn't depend on how many people have died before, but on how many people are infected. According to the same dataset, visualised at https://public.tableau.com/profile/salvatore1114#!/vizhome/wdctest/COVID-19StatusUpdate, the mortality rate fluctuates between 2% and 3%. What it doesn't tell us is how long people were infected before they died. Also, most of the deaths so far have been in China. We don't know what the mortality rate will look like as the disease grows in other countries, which it is definitely doing. What we do know: There are over 45,000 existing cases in China. If 2-3% of those succumb in the next 3 months which is the duration of the question, that makes 900 to 1350 fatalities. That already rules out the first two possible answers. There are about 3000 cases outside China, with big variations in mortality rates between countries. The numbers are pretty small in many countries meaning the rates are probably not reliable yet. South Korea has the most cases, with a 1% mortality rate that would add only about 12 people to the total. Iran has a rate of 14% but fewer cases so would only add about another 10. If we assume current mortality rates will apply to currently infected people over the next 3 months (which is about as long as the disease has been running now to give us those rates), we get to between 3500 and 4500 deaths. If we allow that some of the new cases over the next 3 months may die, even if we don't know the rate, that means a possibility of over 4500 just because a lot more people are likely to be infected. There must be at least some possibility of over 5500 for the same reason. Hence my estimates, which are still incredibly crude and will doubtless need to be revised."

That being the case there would be some 130k people unaccounted for in the figures and 2k of those outside China. The specifics of the Diamond Princess make for an interesting review as this enclosed area with blanket testing to get a better idea of CFR - at around 0.43%, which is more in line with bad Flu rates [2], but would then suggest a very large number of infected people without symptoms / symptoms that suggest standard Flu. This would then push the missing cases up to above 500k and 10k outside of China."

This is an opinion, but I suspect very much that the WHO will confirm the pandemic within the next week. Why? As a fact, Japan, South Korea, Italy and, of course, China all have cases for which they have no idea of the transmission route/vector. It is therefore out of control/an epidemic, in my view. If that is the case, it is so on two continents (and likely a two more in NA and Afr). That's a pandemic. What other facts do we have? The disease appears to be as contagious as flu, but has at least 10 (and possibly 30 or 40) times the mortality rate. If it is out of control, and if as contagious as flu, but, for argument's sake, 20 times more lethal, we are going to be *way* over 5,000 by June. Why? About 8% of the US population catches flu each season. But that's as high as 11% in winter. Let's say that we only have two months of peak virus season left. Let's also say that the weather will be warmer than usual (as Accuweather predicts). Let's also say the novelty of this makes people more likely to self isolate totally or partially. Let's therefore imagine that in developed economies, covering, conservatively, 1 billion people, only 2% of people catch it, and of those, it's only fatal in flu proportions (which we know it won't be). That's still 20,000 deaths by June, just in the developed world -- i.e. 10 times more than we need to get from where we are now to over 5,500. For it to be less, we would have to start seeing evidence of containment within the next week or so, but the trend at the moment, outside China, is the opposite. Furthermore, China is taking steps to restart its economy, suggesting the possibility of a second wave in that country (possibly using Singapore style harm minimisation rather than containment methods)."
