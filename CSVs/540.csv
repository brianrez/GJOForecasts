There are factors consistent with both conservative ideology (free market, freedom of contract, etc.) and liberal ideology (protecting the relatively powerless from exploitation, concern for racial/ethnic minorities who are disproportionately represented among high-revenue generating college sports compared to student bodies as a whole) that could get Justices from both sides on board a decision in favor of the student-athletes. The Justices are very concerned about becoming perpetual referees for what restrictions are allowed and what aren't. Most objective factors weigh against the question. I evaluate the oral arguments as being in favor of upholding the 9th Circuit, but perhaps with some limiting principles."

It is not a question of ahould amateur athletes receive cost of education payments or should the NCAA have carte blanche antitrust immunity. SCOTUS by denying review of Bannon has already indicated NCAA is a joint venture with unique rules but not anti-trust immunity. So should the trial court have done a""quick look"" or a rule of reason review? That is question 1. Question 2 is if a quick look was not required then did the trial judge properly apply rule of reason to concujde the NCAA rules were not the least restrictive set of rules to apply to protect the amateur model? This court is going to rule on the law and some of its own precedents. Unlike baseball exemption created by the supreme court in 1920's there is no Stare Decisis to respect. It passed in Banon. It took this case probably because the new justices wanted it and I think they will uphold the ninth circuit and tell the NCAA to get Congress to grant them anti-trust immunity. The question resolves yes if the opinion says the rules violate anti-trust. The possible outcomes are for the NCAA, for Alston, or sending it back to the ninth for further review. Do not discount that last one. It happens when they quickly grab a case and then realize the record is not fully developed."

There has been some admissions scandles recently which could go the other way. But the morality of not accepting money for college athletics is from a time when college grads made more money from the social capital of mixing with the privileged. Now it's a market like any other.

Making caps obsolete by anti-trust argumentation will create new restrictions to equal and fair competition, compare ""financial fair play"" in general. Furthermore, the rule-setting authority of sports associations in general, and the ability to arbitrate/settle disagreements within the authorities of the world sports, e.g. CAS https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Arbitration_for_Sport seems to be an outstanding principle that the US Supreme Court will not want to topple for the business interest of a few individuals. I'm not sure the SCOTUS will deal with the lawsuit and its antitrust claims at all, since it seems to be a misfit/false claim in the absence of real argument."
