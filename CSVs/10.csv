Inflation is just starting to cool, so from a government standpoint it could be easier to keep the rates low and claim that the policies are working, especially considering that there are upcoming elections."

However, its devaluation has been pretty constant from September 2022 on - and I believe this reflects on the CBRT reports. Since there haven't been any abrupt changes in the conflict in Ukraine, I think it is likely that the interest rate in Turkey will remain the same or even go down a bit."
