Income of streaming services rose over the Covid-19 pandemic, but not excessively. 4) There have been few bankruptcies among cinemas in the U.S. In the years leading up to the pandemic, the number of cinemas was on the rise. 5) Cinemas have been reopening in most states (with allowed capacity ranging from 20% to 100%).
