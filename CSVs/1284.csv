"In Madison v.

A series of strokes has since left him without any memory of the crime, and his counsel is arguing that executing a person for a crime they cannot remember violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment (SCOTUSBlog, Oyez). If the Supreme Court decides to vacate and remand the case for further proceedings, the question will resolve as yes. The Supreme Court is expected to hand down its decision in its 2018 term, but if it does not, the question will resolve as no. Confused?

Wayfair the Chief Justice said: ""Departing from . . . stare decisis is an exceptional action demanding special justification."" The past decision Panetti vs Quarterman is: you must decide it according to the meaning of the Ford vs Wainwright decision. The State of Alabama didn't ask for Ford or Panetti to be reversed and didn't say it couldn't apply to dementia (Roberts clarified this at the start of The State's oral arguments). They just said the lower court did consider it correctly but the lower court started their decision with ""... it must be noted that Madison has failed to implicate Ford or Panetti in this proceeding. Both the court-appointed expert and the defense-retained expert agree that Madison does not suffer from psychosis or delusions."" Roberts has only voted with the Majority to overrule a previous decision once (Janus v. AFSCME) and has only swung the decision to the majority on the liberal side a number of times countable on one hand (National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, Yates v. United States, Williams-Yulee v. The Florida Bar, Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Company v. Owens, Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community) but this might take him on to a second hand."

It feels like Ginsberg and Breyer are now crypto-abolitionist in an era of greater than 10 years of appeals. Sotomayor doesn't seem to think that Madison is rational. The issue for Kagan and Roberts is not actually :""Is Madison competent to be executed"" it is now ""Was the issue resolved appropriately at the lower court?"". Without reading the lower court judgement it is hard to tell if they considered dementia but they did start with: ""Initially, it must be noted that Madison has failed to implicate Ford or Panetti in this proceeding. Both the court-appointed expert and the defense-retained expert agree that Madison does not suffer from psychosis or delusions."" which doesn't imply that the impact of dementia has been considered. Roberts voted in favour of the states being allowed to execute intellectually disabled murders but there was stare decisis to base the new law on unlike Ford."

The subsequent dementia may affect his ability to plead his case in court: whether or not he can remember the crime should not. ""I know nothing' is not a defence for either sane or demented criminals. Does the State execute incompetent criminals? If the State executes anyone, it is for a serious crime, but because this is a judgement of no return, every criminal is given every opportunity to plead the case for remission. If they are incapable of pleading, the State is on thin ice if it executes them: there has not been a full review of the case. Even appointing a court 'guardian' is not sufficient in a capital case as none can direct the case to save their life as well as the person due to lose it. For this reason, even a socially conservative judge might be minded not to execute."

5053,2018-12-17T18:35:50Z,1,[80.0],[80.0],"With Justice Kavanaugh not participating, only 8 Justices will decide Madison's fate. Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch already weighed in when they indicated they would have denied the cert petition and allowed Alabama to proceed with the execution. If Chief Justice Roberts were to agree with them, it would be 4-4 and the lower court decisions would stand and Madison would be executed. A 4-4 split does not seem like a very appetizing way for the Court to decide the life or death of a human being, irrespective of the underlying crime. Roberts allowed a 4-4 split in a 2016 executions, but so far as I can tell that was on a cert petition challenging the method of execution (the drugs used) as opposed to whether the person was competent. In addition, the Madison case is now before the court on the merits. While possible, a 4-4 split allowing an execution to go forward seems unlikely unless he believes strongly that Madison is competent to the executed. Roberts tries to seek consensus where he can and avoids ties if possible. As the tie breaker, then, he will need to decide whether there was sufficient evidence established by the lower court to determine whether Madison is competent to be executed. Roberts established in the oral arguments that this was the gist of the case for him--he is not as focused on whether Madison can remember his crime; rather he is focused on whether Madison can now understand what is about to happen to him. That debate at oral argument turned on whether dementia was sufficient to meet the incompetence standard. Thus, Roberts has 4 choices: (1) dementia doesn't count as incompetence and Madison can be executed--seems unlikely given the gist of questioning and recognition that dementia is an emerging area/issue for aging inmates, (2) dementia counts, depending on the degree/facts of the dementia to understand the circumstances of one's execution, and under the facts of the case Madison's dementia meets the definition for incompetence, (3) dementia counts, depending on the degree/facts of the dementia to understand the circumstances of one's execution, and under the facts of the case Madison's dementia doesn't meet the definition incompetence (5%), or (4) dementia counts, depending on the degree/facts of the dementia to understand the circumstances of one's execution, and the lower court's decision doesn't clearly establish the facts enough to decide that on appeal and that the case needs to be remanded for further assessment by the district court. This last choice may be the best for Roberts, because as a practical matter, it stops the execution while remanding the case for further proceedings in light of guidance around dementia as a test for incompetence (something the Court does need to address as the population of death row inmates continues to age). It also avoids having the perception that the court is making the determination about his competence based on dementia without first hearing specifically about this from the lower court one way or the other. See, for example, the analysis at http://www.scotusblog.com/2018/10/argument-analysis-a-narrow-victory-possible-for-death-row-inmate-with-dementia. It didn't seem as if Roberts pushed the issue about whether Madison was competent/incompetent because of dementia, probably, I think, because it wasn't clear to him from the record whether the lower courts provided sufficient findings to determine that. Unless he can point to specific, concrete findings in the record that gives him comfort that a 4-4- tie is ok, it seems more likely that he could comfortably remand the case for further proceedings. Thus Roberts, will likely want the case remanded, but with some guidance/clarification on dementia and its interplay around the assessment of incompetence. Allowing for some wiggle room because I haven't reviewed the underlying court's findings of fact, I'll give it an 80% probability of a remand or other ruling favorable to Madison."

From looking at the Brief of respondent State of Alabama filed in July 2018, an argument proposed by the lower courts point in the direction of holding Madison responsible for his crime. This argument states that although Madison may not have memory (due to the series of strokes) of the crime he committed, he still has a rational understanding of the crime and its consequences. Thus they state that ""a murderer's inability to remember his crime does not render him incompetent to be executed"" (21) (https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-7505/56028/20180731143532610_Brief%20of%20Respondent.pdf). Moreover, Madison committed the crime with full mental capacity and knowledge (he knew what he was doing was wrong). In essence, due to rulings of lower courts, precedent for other cases (i.e. Bedford v Bobby https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20110518135), and the fact that the supreme court leans conservative (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/28/us/politics/supreme-court-2017-term-moved-right.html)(and thus will rule in favor of the death penalty), the SC is will most likely side with the state."
