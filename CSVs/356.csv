But I think the fact that they rely so much on imports, which are shipped, will likely keep them from making much progress this year. The shipping situation seems to be even worse this year than last year, in terms of both delays and prices. In addition, the FAO Food Price Index has continued to go up in 2021, which makes improving food security even harder, although it does that everywhere to some extent.

The big suggestion seems to be investment in R & D, which isn't likely a short term fix although it should lead to some progress. The global supply chain issues are likely to continue into 2022 and again affect their scoring on this list, although the mid-range forecasts call for some resolution to these issues in the coming year. It seems the most likely scenario is a small improvement, but depending on the world at the time of scoring it seems possible they could regain their 2019 placement."

The UAE has clearly placed an emphasis on increasing food security, and their efforts and results have been impressive (as in other fields as well, including Covid vaccination). As ensuring food security is among the most important functions of government, this effort will increase not only their population's well being but also regime stability and national prosperity."
