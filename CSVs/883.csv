Gretta needs more charging stations - that we agree. How many will be realized is the question. There will be lots of money thrown around on the continent this year, but will it end up in charging station installations? Will people be put back to work installing, will planning and approvals get done with people working from home?"

Does ""will be installed...in 2020"" mean ""will have been installed by the end of 2020"" (including prior-year installations), or ""will be installed during 2020"" (meaning only new installations)? This is a nontrivial difference, unlike my usual nitpicking. I am guessing it means the former, but am probably wrong."

Any demand by EU citizens is going to recover by an S-curve over 12 till 18 months. The people will behave strong risk averse and will delay nearly all high cost demands, example is the recovery of demand after shutdown of Wuhan in April 2020. Shops are open, a few people looking, but nearly nobody demand others like food. The demand curve slope will remain low over a period of 9 months until a vaccine against SARS-Cov-19 is available. Even several hundreds billions will be offered for support of economical recovery of EU member states and industries. The top priority is push of recovery of any economical activity instead of push of specific expensive infrastructure parts. 5G infrastructure support will be seen more important than electrical vehicles infrastructure support."
