How many confirmed cases of COVID-19 will have been reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the United Kingdom as of 1 February 2021? a. Initial Assessment: As of Jan 12, 2021, there have been 3,188,522 confirmed cases in the UK. The number of new cases per day has been on the downslope since Jan 9, possibly because of Boris Johnson’s lockdown(https://covid19.who.int/table, https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/british-prime-boris-johnson-imposes-national-lockdown-for-england-to-combat-new-covid-variant.html ), and is currently at 46,169, down from 68,053 3 days earlier. This is an average decrease of 7,294.6 cases per day. This will likely not keep up, but the lockdown will remain in effect until Feb 1, and police are getting tougher on violators (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/british-prime-boris-johnson-imposes-national-lockdown-for-england-to-combat-new-covid-variant.html, https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-britain/uk-police-to-get-tougher-on-covid-lockdown-rulebreakers-idUSKBN29H0OL ), so there’s no reason to expect cases/day to increase in that time frame, and they may even decrease to base levels of around 16,000, as they were before New Year’s. This would likely take around 4 days at the current rate of decline, however, assuming the rate slows and flatlines around 40,000 with 20 days left (worst case scenario):"

Each day that goes by where the case numbers are over 48,846.28 will cause this number to decrease in order to still not go over 4,000,000. It appears that the case numbers are going up rapidly, and even though measures are put into place to slow this down, it will not start working for a few weeks. It is likely that it will get much worse over the next few weeks, or at a minimum get a bit worse. If case numbers are to go above 4,500,000, the case average would have to go up to 68,846.28 per day as of today (4,500,000-2,778,843=1,721,157/25 days=68,846.28). This seems more likely considering the large increase in cases over the last few days. However, this number will increase each day that goes by where the numbers are not at or over 68,846.28, as it will take more and more cases to make up the difference. For example, if tomorrow there is 62,500 new cases, the new daily average needed to get over 4,500,000 would be 69,110.708 (4,500,000-2,778,843-62,500=1,658,657/24 days=69,110.708) With that being said, this will very likely be in Bin 4 at a minimum, and potentially in Bin 5 by the end of the time period. Taking into account the potential exponential increase of spread due to the virulence of the new strain of COVID in the UK, I believe it is more likely that we will see an increase big enough in the next few weeks to reach the daily average needed to get into Bin 5 than we are to see it stay in Bin 4. The curve has just started going up, and lock down measures are unlikely to have any real effect for at least 2-3 weeks from when they are implemented. Continued increases will be seen during this time frame, followed by a leveling off and then reduction in new cases over a period of time probably equal to a few weeks. The next few days will tell the full story, as it will continue to require more and more daily cases to reach 4,500,000 if there are no further increases in the daily cases seen in the UK. Since 30 December (last 7 days according to the WHO numbers), there has been a daily average increase of 6.217% in case numbers. While this number is likely to go down over the next few days since the first few days had a huge increase, daily increases in the last five days are averaging at 3.096%, which if this holds steady would mean that the average daily cases needed to go over 4,500,000 by 1 February would be reached by the 11th. I am going to bet heavy on the last bin and will update accordingly as the next few days as we begin to see if there are continued increases or not."

The odds of the current lockdown making significant reductions to put average daily new cases at 30,000 seem low. Especially as the UK is still waiting to see the impacts of the lockdown. I'm expecting new cases to slightly reduce. The government seem to see the seriousness of the situation and would probably try even harder to reduce cases if they stayed current levels. Xmas peaks should be past by now on the new cases so I am entirely going on the new strain being the dominant factor. For fewer thatn 3,000,000 cases, the UK would have to average under 11,000. I would even rank the UK reaching 3,000,000 cases by close of play on Sunday 10.01.21 as more likely than being under 3,000,000 on 01.01.21. Current estimates are the 2% of the population has the virus, and the current numbers say that there are over 500,000 people have tested positive in the last 10 days based on the official count. That is a lot of people isolating and/or being very careful - hence they are largely out of circulation. That might be even more effective than the lockdown. I expect to weight my 12% chance of under 3,500,000 down shortly, but I don't think it can be ruled out yet. This will need updating as the pandemic goes through it's course in January."

I think these will start to have a clearer impact once the Christmas holiday season spike is over. I think the current 7 day average of approx 50k is a reasonable expectation over the next four weeks given a likely spike in the next week followed by the fall that usually takes place after restrictions come in. However, the new strain creates more uncertainty as to whether we will see a drop off and it would only take about 63,000 cases a day to surpass the 4.5 million target. I do not think that is a likely outcome given the history of case falls following restrictions but this new strain significantly increases the chances."
