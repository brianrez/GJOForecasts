Still not much has changed, certainly a final agreement reached could be reversed by popular vote preventing a final final one; but things seem to be going along swimmingly, the Farc and government delegations touring the localities where everything is to take place, and an agreement that FARC weapons will be turned into 3 sculptures in Cuba, NYC and Colombia. We will have to wait some weeks until they decide on the artists though...

In the same poll, 66 percent of urban respondents said they believed the peace negotiations would produce a bad deal. Finalizing the deal appears to have given him a bump, though — Santos’s approval ratings rose to 30 percent in July.

The latest alleged attack took place in Caqueta, a province in southern Colombia where the FARC’s 3rd Front is active.
