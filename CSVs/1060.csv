Governor DeSantis has expressed support for the bill. I assume the governor will find time to make a decision on SB 646 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Of all the states with proposals, NJ seems to be the closest; however, I'm decreasing my forecast by 3% due to this question most likely hinging on one state pushing the bill through in roughly 6 weeks."

After reviewing the links for the various bills, I concur that the odds are extremely low that any state would be able to pass a law (this excludes the CA bill, which precedes this question's time frame) in the next 46 days. However, another contributor pointed out that there is a very strong incentive for other states to pass something this spring so CA doesn't end up with a significant recruiting advantage (even though their law won't take effect until 1 Jan 2023). It seems clear also that federal legislation will be required, but that will be many months, if not years, from now at best. So, the most likely scenario is that a state passes something simple (or maybe even symbolic) that meets the threshold of this question for the purpose of competing against CA."

Schools will also be considering if only a few states initially pass the law (even if it is after April) it will likely also have a significant impact on transfers.
