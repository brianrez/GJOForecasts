China projects power through its artificial islands that serve as staging bases for aircraft, warships, and maritime vessels. For a country like Malaysia who is conducting resource exploration in disputed waters, China's expansion represents a direct challenge to their territorial claims. Other tensions have manifested with Indonesia deploying fighter jets and naval ships to deter Chinese fishing in its waters and Chinese vessels sake a Vietnamese fishing boat in vicinity of the Paracel Islands. China's strategy is to slowly wear down the opposition to its territorial claims (Wescott & Lendon, 2020). Since the 1970s, Southeast Asian states have squabbled over the territorial claims to land masses and navigation rights in the South China Sea. China leverages its nine-dash line claims to argue its claims to sovereignty, yet other nations such as the US argue, that freedom of navigation is not trumped by claims to economic exchange zones (EEZs). Washington has interests in maintaining freedom of navigation in the area and provides backing to countries such as the Philippines and Taiwan (CFR, 2021). China uses the US commitment to rules of engagement of the law of war to its advantage. Instead of deterring US warships with the military, China hires fishermen and other non-governmental vessels to harass its neighbors in the region. This strategy effectively avoids the prospect of conflict, offers Beijing plausible deniability, and great political risk of a neighboring country's ship fires on one of the vessels as it would appear an attack on innocent civilians (Gady, 2015). China values stability as a top priority. Making war with neighboring states would certainly destabilize the southeast Asian economies. Alternatively, China employs a long game of incremental aggression that rarely crosses the threshold of conflict that would warrant an escalation of force. The risk of lethal conflict as a result of defensive aggression from Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and/or Vietnam is also unlikely. Although some leaders in Vietnam and Indonesia have attempted to confront Beijing on its incursions, these nations value stability as well and thus would prefer a diplomatic solution to armed conflict. China will not hesitate to retaliate against one of these nations if the US ceases to back them. If the US departs, then the chances for conflict increase as China will capitalize on the power vacuum left behind to secure its national interests in the Sea. Council of Foreign Relations.

Brunei's populace has been showing frustration with the Sultan due to the sluggish economy, corruption, and unemployment. With Brunei being a key node in the Belt and Road Initiative, they could be vulnerable in the future for occupation by China to gain more of a foothold in the SCS. However, I think it's highly unlikely that will happen before the end of the month. Indonesia- (3 pts) 2016- holding Chinese fisherman in a dispute with China over the fisherman claiming they were in ""Chinese traditional fishing grounds."" China has discouraged Indonesia from joining countries that challenge China's territorial claims. 2020- Indonesians captured two Chinese vessels after one of them had a dead Indonesian Fisherman on it. Malaysia- (1 pt) Even though Malaysia's territorial claims overlap with China, they don't seem to be concerned with debating the issue. Placid relations with China could change with the election of Muhyiddin Yassin. The Philippines (1 pt)- tensions between China and the Philippines due to Chinese ships surveying the Benham Rise.

Singapore (1 pt)- ""Mr. Lee laid out Singapore’s interest in and stand on the issue, saying that while the country does not have any claims of its own in the South China Sea, and does not take sides on the specific claims of claimants, Singapore still has a lot at stake in three areas: International law, freedom of navigation and unity in ASEAN."" The only reason I would justify giving Singapore a point would be in the event they discover oil in a potentially contested area. Vietnam (11 pts) - If there's any country that will most likely have a conflict with China over the next month, it's Vietnam. The two countries have had multiple standoffs in the last ten years. Numerous instances of Chinese vessels ramming and sinking Vietnamese vessels have been reported. With the inclusion of cyberattacks on Vietnam from China, I would wager that the likelihood of an attack on Vietnam from China is higher than any of the other countries. I'm giving this a 10% chance for the simple fact of the previous issues between the two countries in the contested areas around the Paracel Islands. Also, an additional point just because it's another country on the list that could potentially conflict with China. When it comes to the South China Sea, China is focused on expanding their territory, and they know the real threat to their success is the United States. Since 2015 Xi Xinping has focused heavily on developing China's Navy. Now with the largest navy in the world, China is poised to defend the territory they think belongs to them. The sheer number of their vessels (360) sounds daunting, but the US Navy still has better manpower, more experience, and better training. Additionally, US ships are armed more heavily."

However, China passed a new Coast Guard Law on January 22, 2021, which “empowers the force to ‘take all necessary measures, including the use of weapons, when national sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction are being illegally infringed upon by foreign organizations or individuals at sea’” (Philippines protests new China law as `verbal threat of war’, 2021). Considering the actions that China has already taken in the SCS, and the fact that it claims most of the SCS as being within its territory, this new law creates a much higher likelihood of China sparking conflict in the SCS against rivals including Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and/or Vietnam. I gauge that the overall threat is low but probable within the timeframe of this prediction, however long-term is a whole nother story."

The reason I am giving this 20% is due to the fact that China is currently disputing sea claims with several of these countries (Krishnankutty, 2020) and that China has recently utilized force in their border dispute with India (BBC, 2021)."

Confrontations stemming from these disputes have involved police/military forces of the respective country’s sovereign waters and the fishing vessels of other claimants who entered the waters. The coast guards of various claimants have encountered each other and used intimidation tactics as well . However, there has not been a lethal confrontation between the respective militia/military forces/law enforcement of the claimants yet.

A lethal confrontation or an escalation that would lead to increasing tensions would not be advisable for any of the parties listed above.

Looking at China's long-term goal, it does not intend to pursue control over nations militarily but rather economically. Its one belt-one road initiative is a prime example of how it intends to increase its influence. In addition, the date is a month away, and there tend to be signs alluding to possible lethal confrontations, which have not been seen as of yet."

In September 2020, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Myanmar, Indonesia, Brunei, and the Philippines in an effort to deepen mutual trust and promote cooperation, with Yi emphasizing that China-ASEAN relations is one of his top priorities. China and ASEAN countries have cooperated closely in a joint pandemic response, working together to develop and distribute vaccines, indicating non-hostile relations. However, over the past year, tensions have risen out of China’s aggressive behavior in the South China Sea, with Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines (along with a handful of Western countries) releasing statements calling on states to follow the rule of international law. In 2020, China increased tensions between itself and Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines as the Chinese Coast Guard sank a Vietnamese fishing boat (no one was injured), a Chinese ship entered contested waters off Malaysia, and a Chinese warship aimed its weapons control radar at a Philippine naval vessel; however, no direct military conflict occurred. It is well-known that China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Brunei are locked in an overlapping series of maritime and territorial disputes, and though tensions between China and these countries wax and wane, it seems as if China is currently focused on strengthening diplomatic relations with ASEAN countries and keeping an eye on Western powers, especially the US, who send naval assets through the South China Sea region. Additionally, China has launched a month of military exercises and closed off around 80 square kilometers in Chinese waters for the month of March, so it is likely that military attention (at least the navy) will be diverting its attention to these exercises. There is a very low likelihood of a lethal military confrontation in the next month; however, with tensions being so high, it is possible that a ship or submarine in the wrong area or a trade dispute could escalate into a lethal military conflict, which is why I am giving a 5% likelihood of occurrence."

Since Germany is also planning to send a warship through the area, the Chinese government will likely sense increasing pressure from NATO powers and focus their attention on these issues rather than squabbles with the countries in question. Any lethal engagements with neighboring nations in the South China Sea littoral region would likely only fuel further western pressure against China and not work to the advantage of the Chinese Communist Party, thus I suspect it is almost certain China will limit military action to their usual posturing against western naval vessels in the area. Based on this, I am forecasting a 99% chance there will be no lethal confrontations between China and Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and/or Vietnam prior to the end of their military exercises concluding at the end of this month. If Chinese military activity in the South China Sea does not decrease following the conclusion of this exercise, it may be indicative of intentions to conduct territorial enforcement operations which could lead to lethal confrontations like those seen from Russia in the Eastern European region, however, this is not within the bounds of this question or response and would require further research for a more informed analysis. As a result, I am only assigning a 1% chance to the question posed."

China joined 20 countries in the Pacific region in 2014 to agree upon safety and communication procedures as prescribed in the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES) to regulate encounters between naval ships and aircraft at sea -- but there is still much work to do to clarify rules.

Although there have been several run-ins between Chinese civilians and those of their SCS neighbors, government forces have not engaged. China is currently facing significant domestic issues ranging from being ground zero for CoVID-19 to Uyghur Muslim concentration camps. Now with the new Biden administration recently pledging support to Taiwan, China will not be eager to stir the pot with their neighbors. In the long-term, the SCS will continue to remain a hot spot, especially as it relates to control over fisheries; however, a lethal confrontation before 1 April seems highly unlikely."

The last thing China wants right now is a reason for the West, ASEAN, and others like Australia to become more united in their opposition to China and violence is a quick way to make that happen.

However, the instances of these incidents leading to a killing. It is also interesting that Japan and Taiwan were left off this list, since these nations have multiple disagreements in the East China Sea and frequently interact with one another in the air and on the sea."

These 6 countries are no match militarily against China and will try to avoid serious confrontations. At the same time, China does not need to resort to lethal confrontation to get its way. However this does not preclude fatalities in the civilian population, such as fishermen. Accidents happen. But civilian casualties are not included in the question."

The world is anxious, and each nation outside of the SCS is distracted by its own domestic COVID and economic issues. I believe the UN is in a place where many UN Partners are not interested in dealing with an aggressive China. China is a large and influential trade partner. Many Nations are facing economic issues at home in response to COVID and may be less likely to take action with China that could further hurt their economy. If China shares this perspective, it may allow China to act even more aggressively in the SCS region. On the other side of potential conflict, nations with interests in the SCS may be getting close to the end of their rope. This feeling could push at least one of these nations into a situation where they believe a rational response to further encroachment/aggression from China is the application of lethal force, even if they don't already have broader support aligned ahead of time. In addition, there is an election in the US that may impact China's actions. A well-timed lethal event with China may impact the upcoming election or test the president following the election.

This is a base rate of 0.5 incidents per year. However, since lethal confrontation in the context of this problem needs to involve a fatality for military forces and fishermen are not military forces, we will discount the base rate of 0.5 to 0.1 since civilian violence could be an indicator for future military violence. Furthermore, some analysts believe that the current pandemic will diminish the capacity of states to dedicate themselves to the resolution or prevention of conflicts (https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/03/24/world/coronavirus-conflicts/#.XzFkCC1q2-o), so further adjustments to the base rate will be made to reflect the ongoing pandemic (reduction to 0.08)."

The reason for this being that military escalation on behalf of China would attract American attention, and likely even intervention, thus deterring China from pursuing an agenda of aggression. Moreover, historically, this is not an area that is prone to military conflict. In the last 45 years, there have only been 2 military conflicts in the area between China and Vietnam. On June 15, however, China pursued a military conflict with India in regards to a border dispute, resulting in a few dozen deaths. This was done as a demonstration of strength on China’s part after both its reputation and economy suffered as a result of COVID-19. Despite this, it is unlikely that an escalation to this scale would occur within the South China Sea, as the repercussion would be far greater. The skirmish that took place with India was so minuscule in comparison that China even announced that it would not impact trade relations between the 2 countries."

Of course, with the coronavirus still rampant, it seems like military confrontation is still at least several months away (if at all -- much like US-Iran conflict to start out the year).

Nothing has happened lethally between these countries, and honestly the state of the pandemic makes lethal confrontation slightly less likely anyways. Until then, my rates will not really change, and no geopolitical evidence of conflict has emerged since I made my last forecast"
92795,2020-07-27T23:25:57Z,3,[20.0],[10.0],"While I believe the current probability is fairly low (~10%), the potential swings much higher when considering the potential political turmoil that the US faces in the coming months. Biden's ""tough on China"" stance potentially increases global tensions with China, which would greatly increase the possibility of a lethal confrontation before April 2021. While this is much harder to quantify, any fatal confrontation is more likely to be some sort of global political statement from China rather than an accident or in self-defense. The upcoming uncertainty is what causes me to double my previous fair value."

The US has said it will support countries that are bullied by China through legal means. However, the US has done a military exercise with India, which shows that they are willing to do military demonstrations with countries in the region. I see the increase in military exercises combined with the fact that another country local to the region hasen involved as increasingthe chances by roughly 5%. I did not increase this by more because I'm still taking into account the fact that the countries militaries are not as advanced as US/China's militaries \, so may not be able to participate in a military exercise that could lead to lethal confrontation."

This signals increased tension between the two countries, and often consulates are closed before major conflicts. Although the US is not one of the listed countries in the posed question, increased tensions with the US make Chinese conflict with one of the listed nations, such as the Philippines or Singapore, more probable. 2) China has had increased military demonstrations in the sea recently.

Since my initial forecast, the US has formally rejected China's maritime claims in the SCS, increasing their commitment to the issue.

With such a large concentration of powerful countries that could potentially get involved in these affairs, one would believe it is in China's best interest not to engage in lethal confrontation. https://www.cfr.org/interactives/chinas-maritime-disputes?cid=otr-marketing_use-china_sea_InfoGuide#!/chinas-maritime-disputes?cid=otr-marketing_use-china_sea_InfoGuide"

There's been a lot of scuffles around the border, and as recently as mid-June there was a lethal altercation between India and China and 20 troops were killed. However, I've realized that this question is not focused on border disputes, but rather the south china sea dispute. I think it is highly unlikely to see a real lethal confrontation in the South China Sea because the US has gotten heavily involved in this region, and I do not believe that China would be willing to draw the ire of the US. On the other hand, we have seen escalation under the pandemic, and there is evidence of military drills being performed in the South China sea. Lastly, the base rate is very low--the last lethal confrontation was in 2004 (as mentioned in the slides) so we can be fairly certain that there won't be a lethal confrontation, and any escalation in presence will be matched by the US on behalf of the countries listed."
92791,2020-07-06T15:53:45Z,1,[7.0],[7.0],"As others have established fairly extensively, the base rate is in the neighborhood of 5%. On top of this base rate, I think that there are a couple of important factors to consider. First, China has demonstrated recently that it is quite willing to push on the boundaries of international approval, especially as it comes to its territorial control. There was the lethal clash between Chinese and Indian soldiers, as well as the assertion of Chinese authority over Hong Kong in spite of international agreements and disapproval. Further, tension has been growing in the area of the South China Sea recently, with China increasing its activities there, as well as the United States conducting military exercises. I think that the demonstration of China's willingness to risk international sanction increases the likelihood fo a lethal conflict, as does increasing activity in the South China Sea. However, I think that the strong US military presence in the area works against there being a lethal conflict, as China will be unwilling to risk a direct military conflict with a major trading partner and nuclear power. Because of this, I think that the US military exercises meaningfully reduce the chance of a lethal conflict in the area. All together, I believe that the chance of a lethal conflict is slightly higher than the base rate, though primarily because of the possibility of the US pulling out of the area."

China has had precisely 1 lethal confrontation in the last 5 years lending us a baseline rate of 5% per year for conflict, adjusting for this 9 month span that means we have a baseline rate of 3.75% for conflict. The SCS dispute is increasingly hostile but today's culture of war via cyberattacks and threat of economic recoil is far more likely to occur than lethal confrontation. I still will adjust to lend greater probability on this event because even given today's stress on confronting COVID as a priority rather than the senkaku islands, China has remained vigilant in their patrolling of this area. However, the choice of countries here discounts India, which is the most probable country that would arise in having a lethal confrontation with China and likely remove the presence of other countries on this list from facing lethal confrontation. Thus, I presume that the odds of conflict are not going to increase by more than 50% than the baseline rate so we are expecting conflict with more than 3.7% and less than 6%. I still put higher emphasis on the potential for this to occur and so I'll say it's 5%."

From there, the tension in these countries over the South China Sea has been increasing and the recent military actions, giving reason to increase the estimate about 11% chance per year . However, the world is currently very occupied by covid and a military action would be politically incorrect and more unlikely for atleast the next 4 months. In addition the conflict with India makes this less prevalent than an action against India would be.As for the last 5 months, the event could occur with about 10% chance per year, standardizing this and rounding up for a non-zero value for the first four months gets the value of 5%."

The lack of inclusion of India makes this event far less likely, and India's presence may very well crowd out other conflicts that might skirmish with China in high border dispute regions. This event is only in 10 months as well, and a lot of states are still experiencing coronavirus issues that might reduce odds of military conflict/global issues"

Moves are made in the form of scaring fisherman from certain parts of the sea, or drilling oil rigs in contested spots. Although armed conflict has happened in the past between military forces from China and other countries relating to South China Sea claims, the evidence points towards a passive aggressive territorial dispute with no actual armed conflict between military forces."

Thus, in the remaining time of the forecast, I operate on a prior of 3.75%. However, there have been some trends that suggest that there may be a higher chance of confrontation looming. The China-India border conflict in June demonstrates that China is more than willing to take action in border disputes. Additionally, due to USA warships entering the South China Sea, a statement was issued stating that China is ready to fire anti-cruise missiles to sink these ships, with China wishing to establish control over the sea."

This gives a new base rate of 5% (1 event), which I adjusted to reflect the 8 months remaining to April 1, 2021. The Covid-19 crisis skews this estimate down, as it is unlikely that either countries would begin a conflict during a pandemic. Recent tension in the South China Sea, as well as China's growing aggression following the Hong Kong security law skews this estimate back up. Finally, the US's announcement of its ships in the South China Sea could skew the estimate either way, by deterring such an escalation in conflict with other South East Asian countries, but by also worsening tensions through military presence."

While the possibility of confrontation seems pretty high based on these reports, it is necessary to consider the historical base rate for the particular conditions of the question (lethal confrontation between military of China and various South Asian countries). Many of the news articles have been about the possibility of confrontation between the US and China (although this impression may be biased from searching through US sources), not between China and South Asian countries. Additionally, since Xi Jinping came to power in Nov 2012, there have been a handful (at least 3, based on my searches) notable confrontations between China and South Asian countries (Hai Yang Shi You 981 standoff in 2014 between China and Vietnam left 17 injured and damaged ships, destruction of fishing vessels in May 2015, fishing confrontation between China and Indonesia in March 2016). However, these confrontations have largely been between fishermen, not military, and they were all non-lethal. Thus, my base rate for lethal confrontation in the South China Sea is close to 0%. Given the recent China-India military conflict, my base rate for general lethal confrontation involving Chinese military in the next 9 months is about 10% (1 conflict in past ~90 months of Xi Jinping in power). Finally, given that Biden is leading Trump in election polls, the US and China may have different levels of tensions in the South China Sea by next year. Assuming Biden is more likely to become president and assuming attempts to deescalate tensions between China and other countries (as under Obama), my updated rate is closer to 0% than 10%, yielding 4%."

It is also looking to assert its vaguely drawn 9-dash line territorial claims with that of Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Vietnam. Confrontation would be nearer and not in international waters. American Navy patrols increase its determination to assert any sovereignty and send a message to USA. Confrontation would be due to escalatory threats and hostile intents of the Chinese Navy towards these countries. However the intention is not to provoke a confrontation but to assert dominance which can be taken too far if understood by the other party as of immediately threatening to a nation or ship. Such escalation would be rare and small in nature due to following of procedures and caution of the SEA navvies."

This has caused China to take a more aggressive stance as exhibited by the AIIB/Silk Road Initiative, their response to Hong Kong protests / encroachment on HK liberties, and border disputes with India (which resulted in 20 dead Indian soldiers). Therefore, I believe China will be notably more aggressive over the next 20 years than in the past 20 years. Given this likelihood, I will update my total probability estimate to 7%. I will note that the question asks about from now until April 1, 2021 which is 0.75 years from now. Therefore the prior is technically 3.75%.

China’s communist party is not winning popularity contests with anyone, least of all with their own people. They will continue with Xi’s historic playbook of appealing to the nationalist pride of Chinese citizens in order to turn their attention from his own failures to things they agree with. He will insight anger over Hong Kong and Taiwan as they are viewed as internal conflict by more Chinese than South China Sea conflicts. He will use this to his advantage by creating an incident where it will appear to his people that China has been directly threatened by western powers and he will come to the rescue by making a bold move such as military occupation of PLA and martial law In Hong Kong as well as heightened harassment of Taiwan especially economically. Vietnam, the Philippines, and other South China Sea states are in danger in the long run but outside of the near term concern for China. Once the communist party of China feels more secure in their situation, such as after they recover some of their economy and feel that public opinion in China has settled to at most an enthusiastic continuance if the Mandate of Heaven upon the current regime or more likely a majority apathetic position as people calm down and fall back into their sense of no control and no power to change things for the better. After this calming of the masses, China will turn again with devious means to undermine not only the sovereignty of the states of South Asia but will most definitely seek to exact revenge on those who replaced them as suppliers of goods to the West. They will step up pressure on Vietnam via economic sanctions and pressure on the Philippines by inching closure and closer to Luzon. I put a 20% chance in the question solely because, though the likelihood that China will do these things in the South China Sea within the next year is low, the likelihood that a person will die due to a boat collision in a minor confrontation between China and Vietnam, Taiwan, or the Philippines is high as they try to maintain what they see as the status quo while they clean house in the mainland.
