On top of that, Kenyans newspaper stated, “Blinken affirmed the US will be keeping an eye on the election, recalling a conversation he had with Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary, Ambassador Raychelle Omamo. In addition, the US Secretary called on IEBC and the candidates - Deputy President William Ruto, former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, George Luchiri Wajackoya and David Mwaure to run peaceful campaigns.” This focus of the U.S. gives hope and light to Odinga who is running on a platform of democracy and free elections.

However, 14% of respondents said they are undecided and another 9% refused to disclose their preference according to the organization. Given that there is still a large portion of Kenyans that are still undecided, there is a very real possibility that the election can go either way. Furthermore, Odinga has also selected a Woman from the largest ethnic group in hopes of attracting more votes from the majority as well as encouraging more women to vote. However, given Kenya's patriarchal society structure this choice has the potential to be Odinga's downfall, as gender-based discrimination is still very prominent in the country."
