A logistic curve is generally used to model the spread of a disease (see SIR models), and seems reasonable here since although there is an acceleration of vaccines at the beginning, but will slow down near the end due to less people available to vaccinate, and the accessibility issues."

According to other sources I think they have the supply to keep that trend going or even increase it soon. Currently around 316 million, so the trend would put them hitting 600 million in 2.5 months or so, so end of September or early October. So I'm focusing on the middle bucket with plenty of probability given to the later buckets since 600 million is around 63% of the adult population so vaccine hesitancy may slow the rate."

Total currently at 313.5M, as of July 14. One would hope that vaccination could proceed at at least the current pace, if not faster. At the same average pace as that seen in the last month, 600M would be reached in ((600M-313.5M)/3.60M) days = 79.6 days => October 2.
