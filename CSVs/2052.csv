However it is linked directly with the second one, and the heavy investment of Taiwanese in PRC. Also interesting is, that the democratic development will give more parties a good chance to win seats ( beside the two dominant ones). Therefore a majority for the DPP will be more difficult in this election of 2016. However as i read the comments and analysis, it looks like, that the likelihood for DPP to get a plurality in the LY, is quite good"

Although I had heard of the Sunflower Movement and studied the history of China and Taiwan, I had not at all followed any of the political events in any level of detail. Currently the two leading parties in Taiwan are the KMT and DPP. The major political issues are the relationship with China and the economy (which are obviously two very interlinked issues). The two main and opposing views with respect to both these issues, is whether Mainland China and Taiwan should be unified into one country, or if Taiwan is and forever will be a separate nation. The DPP and its affiliated parties, known as the Pan-Green coalition, assert that Taiwan is a separate country from the PRC. The KMT and its affiliated parties, known as the Pan-Blue coalition, assert the opposite and have as their aim either a closer relationship with China or in some cases even a total unification of the PRC and Taiwan. The KMT have dominated politics since 1947, with the DPP having some control on and off in the last ten years. As of 2009, the KMT led government has been rapidly improving the political and economic relationship with China, and China is now one of the closest trading partners of Taiwan. It should be noted that both the KMT and DPP leadership have in the past been accused of corruption on several different occasions. There are other political parties in Taiwan, however they are minority parties that are already closely aligned with either the DPP or KMT. This alignment is mainly related to the discussion of whether Taiwan should be an independent nation, or whether Taiwan and mainland China should reunite."

Times are different now, with two of the last four elections been pluralities. From a base rate perspective this suggests somewhere between 50-85%, say 65%. The analysis by Jean-Pierre seems to suggest a majority is possible and the DPP are leading in the polls quite well (though there is a reasonably high level of non-respondents), so assuming the non-respondents distribute in line with polling they would get about 40% of the vote, which seems to sit exactly in the middle of the threshold between plurality (<35%) or majority (>45%).

Remains 95 to be divided between plurality or majority. DPP needs 57 seats. I guess based on December polls DPP can expect over 40% of the votes or ~14-15 seats for the proportional representation part of the yuan. Assuming the Aborigine seats are a loss the DPP needs another 42 or 43 seats of the 73 districts with a First past the post method. I can't find any polls per seat. The KMT got 48 district seats with 45% of the votes in 2012. Seems that should be enough to make if the current polls are accurate and nothing changes."

Interestingly, the DPP's results in legislative polls lags behind that of its Presidential candidate. That suggests they will get the most votes. Taiwan's parliament has 113 seats. 73 are elected in geographical districts and 34 based on proportion of the national vote. First, based on national polls, it seems likely the DPP's floor is about 40% (that gets them 14 of 34 proportional seats). To get to a majority, the DPP would need win 43 of the 73 constituencies (almost 60%). Unless undecided voters break dramatically against the DPP, because of the first past the post system Taiwan uses, it seems the most probably outcome would be a DPP majority."

The PR seats will likely translate more directly to seats, so we can take this as roughly 30% of the 34 PR seats (or around 10 seats there). In the single member districts (first-past-the-post system) a polling of around 35% should translate into a more significant share of these seats given that the DPP will likely be the largest party in many of these districts. It is conceivable that this type of polling would result in around 60-70% share in the 73 seats elected with this method (or around 45-50 seats).

The DPP would certainly pick up extra seats among those allocated proportionally, but the majority of seats are winner-take-all.
