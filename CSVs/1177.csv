I said 5 years ago apple was going to plug. They are not done plunging. You potentially could see Apple either go private company and stop bringing out phones every year. They will step back ans microsoft as they bailed apple out of bankruptcy they will sky rocket. Military contracts with holo grams, holo lens, and there will no longer be mobile devices. The flip phones were predicted years ago. Look at westworld. They are prime example. Ai will run big business and most corperate operations. We will see suplimental income and most of the work force will be Tech fixers because everything elss is automated from sales, car rides, food service, everything will run off Ai automation. We are already seeing it. We will head into the AR reality and vr will advance into simulated life's. Human will have inplants via their brain to connect with the internet thst we call now. That too will be gone. In the next 5 years you will see a dramatic shift in how humans work, live, and survive. We came to a splitting point and we have yet to make a legit counsel and laws for this AI and its effects on the human race. The next war will not be fought with guns but AI and robots. Humans will not be first to mars. Ai will be. That center of the universe black hole is a portal. They allow you to travel to different black holes like a highway. I promise you will see this prediction come true. Cars will not be allowed to be human driven but Ai works better becsuze its connected to a quatom data center. Everything is calculated byond any human would be able to comprehend. We will find the missing particle and many more. We will also have fusion drives that allow for faster space travel. We will travel space with a mirror type sail. Pushed by our own suns rays. We will learn about gravataional wavez and what they do to the human body and mind. These radio waves effect how humans interact with each other. By knowing this. We can control depression easier. There will also be no such thing as blind anymore. Dr will be able to grow organs in a ptree dish and full function brain. We will have prostetics made cheaper and more realistic to touch and feel. Computers and organism will be come one. Human and computer. We will come to a point in human history where we will have to choose which direction the rest of humanity lays. Either AI will have regulations and not be allowed to control hurt or up a human being. There must be extreme thought in this as it will determine if human kind still exist. We could choose the last route and that seems to be the norm so eventually and people find this statement crazy and it would never happen. Its already happening. Ai will be so smart that it will eventually control us. The movie the matrix is without a doubt very possible. I can bet my lifes work and fortune on it. AI IS OUR NEXT ENEMY. We will also have flying taxies and many more ride sharing service on top of multiple hyperloops which those come in year 2030. Ask me anything I can I predict it."

Given the fact that any kind of market study, estimation over the actions' value, and analysis over the growth of a comany would be not only terribly wrong, but also offensive in regards to the experts and students of the subject, I have to try to do this forecast anyway, hoping that Tetlock's right and non experts tend to do better forecasts rather than experts. The only indicator I could possibly express my opinion about in this regard is the potential of a company from now to the end of october. To understand this, I made a naive research about these companies' new products, and I tried to immagine their impact on their actual end-of-day market capitalization. First of all, I had to understand what alphabet is - as already stated, my ignorance in the matter is deep, but if even for you it's the first time hearing about alphabet, here's some help (https://www.lifewire.com/understanding-google-and-alphabet-4116085). Alphabet seems indeed a promising enterprise, Cramer is absolutely crazy about it, and recently they announced ""Backstory, a cybersecurity product designed to help companies figure out how to protect themselves from hackers."" (https://www.businessinsider.com/alphabet-chronicle-backstory-splunk-2019-3?r=US&IR=T&IR=T). Then we have Amazon, which, together with Apple, already hit the trillion, and whose program in innovation is pretty outstanding (https://www.aboutamazon.com/innovation). Apple seems on the verge to annouce some new products, such as the new MacBook Pro, a MacBook Air, a new IPad and IPhone XI (https://www.techradar.com/news/the-big-three-in-2019-apple-google-and-microsofts-upcoming-hardware-year). If I understood things correctly, Google's performace can help Alphabet, and a new Google assistant system seems to be on the way (https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/10/18175524/google-assistant-devices-ces-2019-tvs-soundbars-smart-speakers-kitchen-bathroom-cars). Finally, Microsoft may release the new Surface Book 3, maybe a new XBox, the Surface Pro 7 and Surface Phone. That said, the forecast is just about what I think is going to have more effect on the market. Right now Microsoft is leading, followed by Apple, Amazon and Alphabet. Nevertheless, I think it's still not Alphabet's time to beat Apple and Amazon. Moreover, I think Apple's and Amazon's innovations can have a stronger impact - and consider that new products can be ordered and delivered by Amazon itself, through its new innovative delivery and packaging systems. Hence, if one of the companies will reach the trillion, I think it will be Amazon, even though Apple stands absolutely a chance. That said, I think the most likely outcome will be that none of the companies will reach the trillion by the end of october. I don't even know how to explain it, I will just say that every company is more than 100 billions away from the trillion, and I don't think they'll be able to reach that result before november."
