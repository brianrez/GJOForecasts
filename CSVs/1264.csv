"In Gamble v. United States, will the Supreme Court overrule the ""separate sovereign"" exception to the Double Jeopardy Clause?",2018-10-12T17:00:09Z,2019-06-17T17:00:37Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']","['Society', 'US Politics']",296,654,157,237,"Terance Gamble was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm by both the State of Alabama and the federal government (SCOTUSBlog). He appealed his federal conviction, arguing that being prosecuted for the same crime by two courts violates the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment (Constitution Center). The Eleventh Circuit affirmed his conviction, noting that the Supreme Court had ruled “that prosecution in federal and state court for the same conduct does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause because the state and federal governments are 'separate sovereigns' (SCOTUSBlog).” The Supreme Court is expected to hand down its decision in its current term, but if it does not, the question will resolve as no.

Gorsuch got a little closer to Gamble's position with the questions about federalism, so in a best case for Gamble, three...maybe four if J. Kavanaugh goes along. But J.
