Chevron fell by more than 50 per cent in spring 2020 due to the blood bath on the oil market (their business model is long crude oil price by nature and long travel due to downstream products). As stocks in general are currently ""ambitiously priced"" to say the least considering political markets ahead of US presidential elections and economic reality, the S&P500 is likely to fall over the next month. High beta means Chevron is likely to exaggerate the drop and will fall even more. I guess the stock is going to see 65USD before it can turn better. Stabilizing crude oil markets and more demand for gas is likely to compensate for some of the recent troubles, and Chevron announced it is going to pay a dividend anyway (cashflows are likely still positive). But things are never going to be the same, easy cakewalk for Big Oil again, since the political will for a substitution of fossile fuels by sustainable energy production and a de-carbonization of the economies and most societies seems real this time."
