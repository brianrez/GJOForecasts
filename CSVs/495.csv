94606,2021-05-25T17:45:11Z,4,[84.0],[4.0],"This article, https://bit.ly/3vkQVoR, linked by @dn nearly three weeks ago (https://bit.ly/2SlktnP) indicates that Poland has approved the legislation for ORD (and confirmed by @slapthepancake). However, Poland has yet to advise EU according to the EU table, https://bit.ly/3vkQVoR, as of today (with last entry being Finland's notification of 4 days ago). In principle, that leaves Austria, Netherlands, Hungary and Romania to notify. My understanding is that Romania has approved the legislation but is yet to notify the EU. So, Austria, Netherlands and Hungary appear to be the laggards. Netherlands does not have a formal government at the moment. Will the 'caretaker' government have the ability or courage to approve such legislation? Or will Hungary continue to hold out in opposition to the rule of law element in the ORD? As Oban and Kurz are apparently on good terms, (https://bit.ly/3uoYw4y), will they both attempt to use their legislation / notification to leverage their respective objectives? Kurz obviously has his own battle to fight at home regarding the investigation into corruption in his government (https://politi.co/3yFCmyc) which may in turn lead to his demise from office. I've read a few comments suggesting Austria could be heading for elections in the coming weeks or months (https://twitter.com/markus_pausch/status/1396518490526396416?s=20). Will Austria approve and notify before then? As the number of countries to notify dwindles, so, potentially, the 100% for this question should become clearer. However, the laggards potentially present the biggest challenge to the 100% answer, IMHO."

Countries are already incorporating the funds into their budgets for the next year (https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/03/31/europes-radical-economic-response-to-covid-19), so they don’t expect it to fail. The European Commission expects the ratifications to be done by late June, presumably to allow for the inevitable domestic political negotiations to take place, so if there are still problems by that point then I’d start to be worried. The sensible time to negotiation concessions was months ago (and concessions were definitely made), and those were made under threat of a hold-up."

That's not a small increase on a relative basis at all! and this is also after an increase from 1.2% as a result of Brexit. This cap will only expire after all debts and loans are repaid, which is expected to be 2058 at the latest. While there seems to be widespread support, approval has been blocked in some countries and I don't have a good sense of how much of an obstacle these will be, considering the immense pressure to go through with the proposal. It sounds like the plan to borrow money to loan out to member states will not go through unless this repayment plan is approved, unfortunately, though I wonder if/when push comes to shove there will be another solution."
