Looking back at previous Olympic results, the winner of the tournament has dropped at least 1 game in pool play 3 of the last 4 tournaments. Therefore, I am not too concerned about the United States dropping a game to Sweden and still believe they are the strongest team in the tournament. However, the winner of the tournament has also been the winner of their group 3/4 times, which it is not looking like the United States is going to do (therefore the United States will have a tougher first round matchup in knockout rounds). So this has caused me to degrade the United States relative to my previous prediction. Likewise, strong performance from GB, Netherlands, Sweden, and Brazil has caused me to upgrade all of their rankings. Finally, Japan has been very underwhelming and will most likely qualify for the quarterfinals as a 3rd seed. This means they will play one of the top two teams in the tournament, making it very difficult for them to move on. Thus, I've made some adjustments to all of my initial predictions. As more results come out, I will continue to adjust as needed."

The most important adjustment made was on ""momentum"" of current results.

On top of that, they have more depth than other teams as well so while injuries may hurt them.

Winning 3/4 of the previous gold medals suggests a 75% win rate. Likewise, the United States has won the last 2 world cups (and lost in the final 3 world cups ago). Considering that these tournaments function similarly, this gives an estimated win rate of roughly 5/7 or 71% win rate at major tournaments. This pushed me to increase my estimated win rate to 60%. One reason I estimate lower than my base rate is that the women's team has had a longer layoff between major tournaments than normal, and their schedule has been less competitive than normal as of late. Therefore, I think the team could be slightly rusty and susceptible to an upset. After readjusting my USA estimate, I left the proportions of my previous predictions the same."

Further, betting odds have them as the heavy favorites to win at +100 (which suggests they are nearly a 50% favorite to win when taking the vig into account). Knowing less about the other countries' recent performance, I made predictions based on research of previous results and betting odds. Finally, I believe there is a 5% chance that the Olympics are delayed, which is why I've given 'No gold medal' that probability."
