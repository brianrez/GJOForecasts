They had gathered in Brussels on Sunday to discuss the allocation of big jobs like the presidencies of the European Commission (the EU’s executive), the European Council (the collective heads of government), the European Parliament and the European Central Bank. Also in the mix was the role of High Representative for foreign affairs and security policy, a sort of EU foreign minister. Yet they could not reach a deal. A package by which Frans Timmermans, a Dutch social democrat, would become Commission president was backed by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron but opposed by other leaders. Central European governments in particular objected to Mr Timmermans’s robust defence of liberal values. Today EU leaders will try to find a blend of candidates that tick all boxes. Mr Timmermans is not yet out of the running, but leaders are eyeing alternatives.“"

Though inflation has been disappointingly low, little is expected from the central bank’s meeting today, beyond the details of its new lending facility to banks. A bigger decision hangs over the institution this year, one that will be made by politicians not bankers: who will replace Mario Draghi as the ECB’s president? Leading contenders include the heads of the French and German central banks, the current and former governor of the Bank of Finland, and an insider already on the bank’s executive board. Politicians know their choice is an important one, given the ECB’s role in propping up the euro area’s economy. But with the job only one among several vacancies at the top of European institutions this year, there is plenty of scope for horse-trading too. This decision might defy prediction.“"

The other contender from the Bundesbank has insufficient support in Europe. Ireland is a dark horse and could be rewarded with this role as a means of strategically addressing Brexit policy issues.

The 68-year-old stepped down from his post as Finland’s central-bank governor in July, and would bring decades of Brussels experience to the top of the ECB as governments try to solve the single currency’s structural shortcomings. *** 2. Francois Villeroy de Galhau, German-Speaking Banker. France’s central-bank governor is considered a serious contender if governments balk at appointing a German. Since taking over at the Bank of France in 2015, Villeroy has stuck close to Draghi’s line backing continued stimulus. 3. Jens Weidmann. Francophile Hawk. Weidmann became the Bundesbank’s youngest-ever president in 2011 after his predecessor resigned to protest ECB bond purchases. Now 50, he’s taken a hard line against loose monetary policy, earning him respect at home but criticism from Draghi for his perceived “nein zu allem”—no to everything—attitude. *** 4. Olli Rehn, Finnish Eurocrat. Rehn, 56, may be one of the newer faces in European central banking, but he’s been involved in economic affairs for years. As EU commissioner in charge of the euro during the region’s debt crisis, he was a strong advocate of ﬁscal discipline before returning to Finnish politics in 2015 as economy minister and overseeing the country’s emergence from a three-year recession. *** 5. Benoit Coeure, Markets Maestro. Coeure, 49, is already on the ECB's Executive Board with a non-renewable eight-year term that runs until the end of 2019. He's highly respected though, and it's possible a way could be found to shift him to the presidency. He's one of the architects behind quantitative easing and is responsible for markets, so he certainly has the necessary experience. 6. Klaas Knot, Dutch Hope. The 51-year-old head of the Dutch central bank is one of the youngest members on the Governing Council. He’s also typically on the same page as Weidmann on the topic of monetary stimulus, speaking out against keeping asset purchases going for too long. 7. Klaus Regling. The Underwriter. One of the architects of the euro, Regling spent a decade at the German Finance Ministry where he helped prepare for economic and monetary union. In his current position leading the European Stability Mechanism, a backstop for countries in financial crisis, the 68-year-old has had close insight into the euro area’s existential woes. 8. Christine Lagarde. Trailblazing Globetrotter. Lagarde made her name breaking tradition in a world of predominantly male economic policy makers. As French finance minister from 2007-2011, she was the first woman to hold such a post in a Group of 8 country, and since then has been the first female head of the International Monetary Fund. Lagarde would also be the first woman to head the ECB and the first president without an economics degree. ________________________ COMMENTS: I heard that Ireland is out. Jens Weidmann to me seems still a very strong candidate that has been on the waiting list for quite sometimes. Besides Germany may want to have that post finally. C. Lagarde may be on the lookout for another big assignment. But she can even have a third run at the IMF, after all the IMF by reappointing her would avoid the headache of the ""... the head of the IMF must not be from EU ..., etc."" So I would rule her out mostly. Besides there was Trichet before."
