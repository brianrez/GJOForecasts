However it does point to dynamics within the region along with the oversupply of oil in the global economy could potentially derail completion of the JCPOA requirements for declaration of implementation day in the nuclear deal. The deepening of the sectarian divide among Sunnis and Shi'ites and its affect on proxy conflicts within the region could potentially affect the progress of implementation day requirements. Iran has however indicated that does not intend to allow these factors to influence its ability to complete JCPOA requirements prior to the Februaryelection. Reformists and conservatives in the Iranian theocratic political system have much to gain and provide considerable influence on the electoral outcomes.

Now that the IAEA report on past violations at Parchin is done, then it is in Iran's control to make implementation day happen Like Iran has a mimimum $100-billion in immediate relief of frozen assets. Like Iran wants to ship oil asap. no hard currrency until then, and I assume that Irans mullahs will ge the sanctions off to obtain the public acclaim. Plus access to Swift Rumors, I stress rumors state before the end of January.

Below is also a link in to the IAEA report.

It appears there are two items that are still under review: Possible Military Dimensions -PMD is pending but suspect some way will be found to meet that requirement. The other item is compliance with ""additional protocol and ""implementation of modified code 3.1."" This refers to transparency and access to sites for IAEA inspections. On page 5, item 18 on the IAEA document there is a statement that says: ""On 18 October 2015, the Director General received a letter from the Permanent Representative of Iran to the Agency informing the Agency pursuant to paragraph 8 of Annex V of the JCPOA that, effective on JCPOA Implementation Day,29,30 Iran will provisionally apply the Additional Protocol to its Safeguards Agreement, pending its ratification by the Majlis (Parliament), and will fully implement the modified Code 3.1 of the Subsidiary Arrangements to its Safeguards Agreement.31."" Since on implementation day sanctions will be removed, this may result in sanction removal prior to Iranian Parliament approval and therefore implementation of the transparency/ inspection component. Did not increase my forecast above 75% because this could cause a delay.

53,2015-11-19T17:05:41Z,10,[55.0],[25.0],Some aspects of the IAEA report seem positive - IR-1 centrifuges being disassembled and put under IAEA verification more rapidly than expected for instance. The rate of disassembly of IR-2m centrifuges so far has been 6/day on average (much slower than IR-1) - either taking more care or started later - or work stoppage? - but have 848 remaining at Natanz. Sounds like progress might be slower at Fordow?

Khamenei has said little more about the plan and rather is blaming U.S. and west for ISIS creation and seems to be working on new environmental issues so basically onto other, distracting activities for now. If the plan goes forward and implemented as expected, and hardliners continue to arrest significant numbers of journalists and others who support ""moderates,"" the pressure & risk involved in voting for a new slate of moderates during the election could result in fewer than anticipated moderates elected."
