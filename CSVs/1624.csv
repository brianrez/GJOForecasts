But the turn out seems to be surprisingly similar to the 41% turn out in 2014, when the police were not blocking voters. I suppose it would be expected that few people who did not want independence would want to risk voting, but the police seem to have been surprising;y ineffective at blocking voters. So the large number of voters injured seems to not have affected the result at all. If Spain was the US I am pretty sure there would be claims that some people were voting twice."

Instead, there will be informal voting in what may well become a mass protest. Those opposed to independence will stay away, so turnout will be crucial, but hard to calculate. The plan was that, in the all-but-inevitable event of a vote to secede, the Catalan parliament would unilaterally declare independence. That now looks unlikely.

If the public do not know if they are eligible to vote or not, or if those eligible to vote do not know how and where to caste their ballot I would not count it as a public vote. Nor would I count it if polling stations allowed people to vote without carrying out a check to see that they were entitled to vote (that would just be a poorly conducted opinion poll). A public vote therefore would require polling stations that were advertised to the public as such. If the public are informed of where the polling station are and when they are open, then that information would be known to the police. If the police know when and where polling will take place they can prevent access to these places, remove list of eligible voters, arrest those administering the votes and confiscate ballot boxes, The public could demonstrate against this, but I can't see how the results of any vote if the voters have to fight their way past the police could be considered valid, unless there was an incredibly high turnout 80% with more than 50% of the total electorate supporting one side and no chance of vote tampering.

If the Spanish government disrupts the distribution of voting cards and access to polling locations, and only (say) 10% of people get to caste some sort of vote somewhere and the votes get counted by people unknown and no one really trusts the result as reflecting public opinion, can this really be called ""a public vote on independence""? If Russia announced that a similar (illegal) exercise in Eastern Ukraine had shown that the public there wanted to become part of Russia, no one would regard it as a real public vote. So I would suggest that even if some voting takes place in Catalonia, in the present circumstance it would not pass the test of showing what the public really thought. I have asked Spanish friends for their views. It would be expected that supporters of Rajoy and the PP would be against the referendum, so I was more interested what younger people who had more sympathy with Podemos (left wing populist party) and who spoke Catalan (or Valenciano) thought. The view was that the situation is a mess with both sides trying to provoke conflict; that the Catalans and the rest of Spain had agreed to the Spanish Constitution that says the referendum is illegal and the Catalan government should do things the legal way (try and get the Spanish constitution changed first); the Spanish Government is determined to stop the vote and they have replaced the 'Mossos de Esquadra' (the autonomous Catalan police force) by National Police from outside Catalonia (my friends find this very significant) the Guardia Civil (the para-military police who's role is to protect the Spanish State from civil unrest) is also involved. So summing up, they think the Spanish Government has the means to prevent the vote and has the law on its side, and that if the Catalan officials don't back down they will face serious legal consequences. They also think that Catalan independence is a distraction from dealing with the real problems that they perceive; corruption by all political groups (particularly the PP but also other parties including regional governments), very high unemployment for young people in particular. So my ""NO"" mean no meaningful public vote, even if some polling takes place."

I don't expect the national government to send in the army or Guardia Civil to physically stop people voting, but who knows they might. Its just a case of who blinks first, Spain has said it will not allow it, the Catalan Parliament has said will take place. Rajoy (Spanish PM) is in a bind. On the face of it, allowing a legal referendum would seem the most sensible thing for him to do, because the polls show that most people in Catalonia do not want independence. The problem is that if Catalonia is given the option of splitting from Spain then the Basque areas (Pais Vasco) would want one as well, and even towns or cities might demand the same, it could even lead to the Catalan parts of France wanting to re-unite with the Catalan parts of Spain and the Basque parts of France wanting to unite with the Basques on the Spanish side of the Pyrenese. In short a redrawing of the map. For this reason Spain and the EU would not want referendums of this type. As far as similarities with Brexit are concerned I suppose there are some. There are closer similarities to the Scottish independence referendum. As Mrs May has said there are people who strongly feel that they are from somewhere specific and there are people who (as she says) who are from anywhere. It seems that ""somewhere"" people don't trust or much like people who don't identify with the same ""somewhere"". ""Anywhere"" people don't much care where people are from they just identify as having things in common with some people and having less in common with some other people, geography (and race and colour) is not a big issue. According to Boris Johnson and Mrs May its wrong for British Citizens to also feel European or part of western civilization, they should just restrict their loyalties to being British. As many of my friends and family live in other countries and/ or are citizens of other countries this seems odd to me. As Boris (until he got a US tax demand) had duel US/UK citizenship, I find his view odd. In my view all nationalism and ""independence"" ""Brexit"" etc. is more about blaming people who are not like ""us"" than rational reasoning. Today on TV I heard a Brexiteer call for more international cooperation to shut down IS web sites and an acknowledgement that leaving the EU would mean some cost to the economy, which would be worth it because it would mean the UK did not need to accept EU (i.e. international) rules. A naive person might think that a united EU might be better placed to deal with international terrorists than 28 separate countries would be. Another Johnson, Dr Samuel Johnson, famously said ""patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel"", today he might have said ""nationalism is the last refuge of the desperate politician""."

It is unlikely but possible that Madrid will use police/military force to prevent the vote, but they are more likely to act with state force should the yes vote carry the day. The PP has taken steps to increase the likelihood of this vote through its policies of denying regional autonomy through court action and threatening public officials with arrest should they allow their communities to participate in the vote. Their intention is to de-legitimize this referendum by creating a low-voter turnout. They are likely to succeed in suppressing the vote in the areas of Catalonia (the larger cities) where support for independence is below 50% and in effect push the pro-independence vote into the majority. Polling suggests that pro-independent voters represent 43% of the vote while anti-independence voters are around 47%. Economic improvement in the Spanish economy is a likely factor in causing some Catalan voters to choose to oppose independence. Nonetheless, if communities that do not favor independence decide to deny the means of voting no and follow the PP directive, they will tip this election to the pro-independence side."

The polls seem to show that support for independence has declined in the last 3 years and it appears that in a legal referendum ""No"" would win (by a small margin) when adjusted for abstentions and don't knows, but in an illegal referendum presumably few ""No"" voters would bother to vote as they know it does not really count. An interesting issue is how few Catalans who are living abroad have registered to vote (5,000 out of 285,000) - I don't know what happens to Catalans who live in other parts of Spain, but if Catalonia has not got access to the official electoral rolls its difficult to see how they can ensure that all voters are eligible or that all eligible are allowed to vote. It would be odd if Catalans who live permanently in other regions of Spain or abroad were able to vote, and people from other regions who live in Catalonia were also allowed to vote. But it would surely also be odd if Spanish people who are not Catalan but live permanently in Catalonia were not allowed to vote.

The Spanish government (SG) appears to have the power to block the Catalan Government (CG) from holding a referendum legally. It is possible, but unlikely that the Spanish Government (SG) will attempt to negotiate with the CG and the CG will postpone the referendum. It is a risk for the CG that is that it holds an illegal referendum and gets a smaller turn out or smaller majority than it did in the similar exercise 3 years ago where it got 80% of the vote, but on a low turnout. It would appear that the SG would only need to take notice if the CG got the support of 50% of voters. As part of the Catalan case for independence rests on the assumption that an independent state could automatically and seamlessly be part of the EU. The Brexit problems in the UK might suggest to Catalan voters that assumptions are not always to relied on. (Could an independent Catalonia's application to join the EU be blocked by the SG?) Evidence from other countries (Canada, Scotland) is that holding referendums on independence can loose impact if they do not get a result first time, so my view is that the CG has little to gain from holding another illegal referendum. Why would many people bother to turn out to vote in an illegal referendum for independence if they did not want independence? They know that even if the ""yes"" vote won the illegal result would not stand and before it was really decided to give Catalonia independence another legal referendum in which they could vote ""no"" would need to be held. https://elpais.com/elpais/2017/08/13/opinion/1502635109_453757.html"
