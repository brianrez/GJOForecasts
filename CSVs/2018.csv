If we take as a starting point that in the past new media does not totally replace old media (e.g. radio did not completely replace newspapers, TV did not completely replace radio) and that old media after declining when new media is introduced usually drops to a new level and then plateaus rather than disappears. ebooks arrived a few years ago, grabbed market share, but now paper books and ebooks seem to be coexisting https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/mar/31/paper-vs-digital-reading-debate-ebooks-tim-waterstone at some point newspapers and magazines will reach each reach a state of balance between paper and electronic versions. The disruption to the newspaper business has been largely due to the move of classified advertising away from newspapers, and the relatively costly expense of distribution. Weekly magazines suffer from these problems less than daily local papers. I see no reason why weekly magazines sold by the annual subscription model cannot continue after we get most of the 'news"" electronically. The daily news, online or in print is (or was) mainly reporting facts (often incorrect facts) while the news magazine is more about fitting the facts into a bigger picture of what the facts will mean mean to the readers in a longer time frame (e.g. its current affairs). So if I take a guess that the decline in newspapers will bottom out in the next four years or so (say 50 months) and that while lots of local news papers will stop the print edition, it will perhaps result in 25% of weekly news magazines stopping their print editions that would suggest that no more than 0.5% of news magazines will stop their print editions each month. http://newspaperdeathwatch.com/ Its seems that newspapers (not magazines) in the US have been closing print editions at a rate of less than 2.5% a year which would suggest that my guess of 0.5% a month is too high and that 0.2% a month is a closer estimate. If so with only 3 months to go in 2016 the likelihood of any one newspaper closing its print edition is only around 0.6%. If I assume that Time is less likely to close its print edition than average then rounded to the nearest whole number give 0%."

498,2016-08-05T01:21:17Z,36,[65.0],[-2.0],"Time Inc. reported their quarterly results today. I'm not sure when the best time to announce any change in publishing frequency would be, but no such announcement was made today. (-2) Some observations/interpretations: 1) They achieved ""crossover"" on advertising, where increase in digital advertising revenue exceeded decrease in print revenue. Digital advertising revenue increased at an impressive 65%, whereas print revenue decreased by 13%. It is unclear if the crossover in terms of profitability has occurred. 2) ""Excluding Viant acquisition, digital advertising revenue would have increased 10% year over year."" Without knowing how they account for intra-company sales, it is difficult to know exactly how to interpret this statement. On the surface, however, this is a rather shocking statement. By ""on the surface"" I mean that the ad sales from the ""digitalization"" of everything Time had prior to Viant, as well all the other non-Viant digital acquisitions, increased by only 10%. This seems like they are unable to touch new customers with existing products. 3) As I read the financials, they burned through $331 million in cash for the quarter. This is an unsustainable rate (although by definition any negative cashflow is unsustainable). Recent announcements of personnel cuts will reduce editorial costs, but will not likely be enough to cover the negative cashflow by itself. Without knowing what the net estimated savings would be in terms of a TIME frequency change we are very much in the dark, but looking to production costs as the next area to cut would mean that such a change in frequency may very much be on the table. Something needs to give with the cashflow. 4) The share price for Time Inc. declined by 8.43% on heavy volume today. With the announcement of the regular dividend, this stock has a yield of 4.9%. 5) Time Inc. continues to claim that they are in the acquisitive mode, although I do not know where they would find the cash. I would not be surprised if they themselves were acquired by the likes of Verizon (although with the decline in share price today it does not seem that the market anticipates this scenario). 6) I have recently begun hearing media commentators refer to TIME not as a ""news"" magazine, but as a ""political"" magazine. Time Inc. refers to TIME as a ""news weekly."""

The great majority of sales are through subscription, though what (to me) is most interesting is the verified subscription of >120,000. Because of this, Time is able to claim in its Media Kit that total readership exceeds 11 million. Add to this the magazine's status as a legacy brand, its up-market demographic and the limited success of its online presence in a cluttered marketplace, and I think the print edition is safe for this year at least."

It appears that Time, unlike The Independent in the UK that recently stopped publishing a print edition, still has a sizable print circulation and it mainly sells via subscriptions (rather than via news stands which gives a more certain cash flow). The long term outlook is not very certain but the US print edition should last another 7 months. As I assume many subscriptions are annual and that many are bought toward the end of the year (as Xmas presents or renewals of past Xmas presents, I would guess that to stop the print edition without annoying people who have just bought a subscription Time would want to announce any plans well in advance. Newsweek indicated it would be going all digital on 25 July 2012, on 18 October 2012 it announced that the US print edition would cease on 31 Dec 2012. So if Time were going to follow the same pattern they would be making the first announcement in the next 12 weeks. As Time group publishes lots of other print magazines they would be sensible to ensure that stopping a print version of Time did not put customers off buying print subscriptions to their other magazines."

Time-Warner spun-off TIME magazine a couple of years ago as I understand it. It seems that, like newspapers, print magazines are facing severe revenue challenges due to the rise of digital journalism. As the revenue decreases, scope and quality of the publications probably also decreases -- a vicious circle. And, many people just don't seem to want to read the news via hard-copy platforms."

498,2016-01-19T04:13:30Z,12,[63.0],[3.0],"For more anecdotal evidence, I've been paying attention to advertising as it might appear on any webpage associated with either Time Inc. or TIME magazine. My impressions are only based on a dozen or so such visits since the inception of this Question. My observations were limited by the fact that I employ a number of various script and ad-blockers with my browser. First, perhaps because of my blockers, I am not seeing any advertising at all for the bulk of my visits. As a recommendation to TIME, they should deliver some classy, non-obtrusive, minimal, single advertisement to every visitor by default (if blockers prevent generation of a custom ad). Second, for those ads that are delivered (I don't know why sometimes and sometimes not), the advertisers are of the type I identified previously in my anecdotal survey of a printed issue (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/90552 ); namely, very large corporations with massive advertising budgets placing ""image"" (versus product) placements. These advertisements were not just pick-ups of those in the printed issue. So, I'm thinking, and the whole point of this post, is that Time Inc. (or TIME) may be making big progress in improving its online advertising revenue. One could imagine that if a sufficient set of these very large (big ad budget) corporations (e.g., IBM) could be corralled with some type of multi-year special relationship (and price) ""bundle"" arrangement, Time Inc. might very well find the funds necessary to ""cut-the-cord"" (a bit at least) on the print side. This is all a long way of saying they may have gotten some topline breathing room, but rather than coast on it, they move with it. (+3)"

There are some number of ""combined issues."" The number of combined issues appears to be at the publisher's discretion; so Time Inc. may already have plans to add another combined issue or two this year as compared to last. They could achieve some cost savings by reduced paper (and printing) and mailing costs (neither of which would likely exceed those of two stand-alone issues). So, we are not forecasting the ""thing,"" but only the ""name."" (-5) 2) The quality of the paper is dramatically inferior to years past. Whatever tactile appeal magazines may have once had, is lost in TIME. Photo quality suffers as well. 3) The collection of advertisers is kind of funny. It's a slice of corporate America (mostly) that you need to see for yourself to get the feel. Big pharma (many), insurance companies (many), AARP and other senior citizen groups, banks, Volkswagen (curious), US Ad Council, and Mexican vacations. Plus an Amazon and another ad that likely reflects some traded advertising as part of their recent strategic relationships. In general, I saw the advertisers as representing very large firms with massive advertising budgets that are probably not required to justify their advertising spend in terms of effectiveness. It's image (versus product) advertising dollars that are farmed through agencies and the like. It would be just that collection of advertisers if there was some group that wanted to support a mainstream narrative of reality. These are not the kind of advertisers that will likely go away if there is a (further) frequency change; but perhaps more importantly, they are so locked in that they can be milked with the current frequency and rate hikes quite a bit longer."

This volume cannot easily be replaced by electronic means even if other subscriptions may continue to be cancelled by individual subscribers. 3m+ circulation is easily sufficient to make it economically viable and profitable to continue with physical circulation of the magazine. Moreover, recent ciruclation figures have been relatively stable for the past few years, suggesting that the impact of online distribution has already occurred and further erosion will be slow - possibly linked to the mortality rates of the older generation of subscribers. Moreover, Nancy Gibb - the current chief editor - was quoted in saying in 2013 that the magazine ""will always exist in print"". Finally, magazine publication is the core business of Time Inc and Time Magazine is the flagship product: A decision not to publish in print would be a radical departure in business strategy that is unlikely to occur first in its flagship prouct - we will likely see moves in this direction first in other publications, including Sports Illustrated etc. I might increase my probability of this event if those type of moves occur first, but for the moment the probability has to be very low (although with the caveat here that the YES is predicated on an ""announcement"" of the move rather than implementation of such a move, so in theory they could announce that they will stop printing in 2025 or so."
