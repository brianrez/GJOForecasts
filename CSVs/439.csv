The lab will also carry out genotype assay testing, which is more crucial to the outcome of this question, but there is no clear guidance when this will start. From the most recent SAGE report (12th July) Point 10: 'High prevalence also presents a challenge to testing, contact tracing and sequencing. If PCR testing and genomic sequencing capacity are overwhelmed, it may not be possible to rapidly identify a new variant'. So capacity is very much an issue, and near or at the current limit: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sage-93-minutes-coronavirus-covid-19-response-7-july-2021/sage-93-minutes-coronavirus-covid-19-response-7-july-2021 PHE (Public Health England) already provides sequencing expertise and support to other countries (through NVAP) but perhaps more significantly has sequenced samples from at least four other countries, and is expecting demand to increase: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/phe-to-provide-genomic-sequencing-support-to-partners-across-the-world Again this demand will limit available capacity each week and may cap increases (barring any mega-lab factor). So summing up: It's still a tussle between immediate demands and available capacity, and while a partially operational mega-lab would have the throughput to quickly increase capacity I suspect they are still weeks from operating efficiently. I'm hedging towards 40K results this week and 40-50K next week."

It gives a rough estimate of 14% increase every week. With this crude rate, Delta cases would exceed 350,000 by 4 August. However, there are many people infected with COVID or fully vaccinated in UK already, and reinfection is rare according to https://www.healthline.com/health-news/can-you-get-delta-variant-if-you-already-had-covid-19#Reinfection-remains-rare.

This means 33,630 new Delta cases this week. It gives a rough estimate of 80% increase every week. With this crude rate, Delta cases would exceed 350,000 in the week of 2 August. However, there are many people infected with COVID or fully vaccinated in UK already, and reinfection is rare according to https://www.healthline.com/health-news/can-you-get-delta-variant-if-you-already-had-covid-19#Reinfection-remains-rare. Therefore, the rate would well be smaller than the crude estimate, and it would be harder to spread when more people are infected, since the uninfected ones would be the once-infected or vaccinated individuals. Using a decreasing rate of 1.8, 1.6, 1.4, 1.2, the cases would surpass 350,000 by the week of 9 August. Therefore, I would say the last two cases are equally likely."

This is completely detached from the reality of case numbers & represents a significant reduction in previous sequencing totals over the last few weeks. There could be several reasons for that reduction, but since the govt is seeking to suppress infection data by ending the distribution of lateral flow tests & mitigations, it makes sense to imagine there may be some political or ideological root cause, whether the mechanical expression of that is a decrease in technician numbers due to funding or infection, a decrease in lab supplies or some other glitch that could have been avoided with different long-term directives from the top.

Recent data suggests that the UK is entering another COVID peak, so it is likely that cases will be able to sustain this exponential growth for the near future. The delta variant has taken hold in the UK over the past few weeks despite robust vaccination efforts, so even as inoculation rates rise, the virus is unlikely to be slowed dramatically.

It was 50% more transmissible than the original, and accounted for 90% of the UK cases at one point. Delta variant statistics: It is 50% more contagious than Alpha, and has rapidly overcome Alpha and now accounts for 90% of the UK cases. Compared to the original, Delta spreads approximately 2.25 faster, and 1.5 faster than Alpha. My estimate for the amount of time is therefore approximately 2.2 months as of June 9, which makes it around August 18. Note that Alpha never exceeded 350K, primarily because it was overtaken by another variant. So, there is also a chance that a new variant arrives that makes the Delta variant never exceed 350K. The variants of concern (Alpha Beta Gamma and Delta), all emerged late 2020. There is a rising variant of interest (Lambda) that may have increased transmissibility, but as potential resistance to the vaccine. For me, this means the probability for a new variant is quite low, and more probable that Lambda will overtake Delta, which is still a low probability (~2%) before August 11."

This exponential model is a common model for infections. Using https://www.bbc.com/news/health-57489740 we know up to June 16 there were almost 76,000 COVID cases caused by the Delta variant in the UK, and that the number of new COVID cases caused by the Delta variant is between around 90% and 100% of new COVID cases from around June 13 assuming trends continue (see graph in link). This is a reasonable assumption as the Delta variant continues to threaten the UK and be a major threat, and is corroborated as per this article which says the Delta variant accounts for 99% of COVID tests in the UK: https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-06-18/delta-variant-makes-up-nearly-all-new-uk-coronavirus-cases. The number of new COVID cases on June 16 was 8808 and the number of new COVID cases on July 5 is 27100. Assuming Delta variant accounts for the lower bound of 90% of COVID cases for both values we can solve to get c=7927.2, r=1.0609. Assuming Delta variant accounts for the upper bound of 100% of COVID cases for both values we can solve to get c=8808, r=1.0609 (note r is the same; this makes sense based on how one solves the equation). We want to find T so that the integral from 0 to T of cr^t dt is at least 350,000-76,000 = 274,000. We can evaluate this integral to be c/ln r (r^T-1). If we take c=7927.2 we get T >= 18.83 and if we take C=8808 we get T >= 17.65. These dates correspond to July 6th and July 4th respectively, that is today. This may see like a harsh prediction but it makes sense considering the 7 day average of COVID cases in the UK since July 5th is around 25k and the 7 day average of COVID cases from the week before is around 16k. Assuming approximately 90% of COVID cases in the UK have been caused by Delta since this comes out to 41k*7*.9 which is around 258k COVID cases since June 21 caused by Delta, matching the earlier predictions. So I will in fact given the probability of this occurring before or on July 14 which is in over 1 week an 85% chance and the following event a 15% chance, giving a 0% chance for the last two events."

So it seems likeliest that the final rate will be determined by throughput capacity. COG-UK have received plaudits for being at the forefront in both quantity and quality of results, but the process does involve a labour-intensive component across multiple labs, specialist kit and trained staff, so they are likely to be working near capacity. Testing numbers seem very unlikely to go down intentionally in the short term, using the same logic as above, and given that multiple labs are handling the process there seems minimal risk of large scale spoilt tests (although I'd need more evidence on this).

It's worth noting this is the slowest of slowest cases (reported linearly throughout) and is quite close to the August 12 cutoff for the last option. Hence, if August 12 comes and the UK hasn't reported more than 350,000 cases, the UK would've likely had serious slowdowns in the their testing protocols.

Due to testing limitations, and weekly trends, the earliest, I think the UK could reasonably hit this total by is July 25th (using the most recent weekly increase), but it is more likely to hit this total around August 3rd (averaging some of the weekly increases). That being said, current research is showing that a new, likely more transmissible strain (Delta plus) will be hitting the UK soon. Since a person cannot be affected by multiple viruses at once, the more transmissible strain can compete with the Delta strain and slow its growth. Factoring in vaccinations as well, it's likely that rates are slowed to under 31,000 cases/week (after August 11)."

If this continues there is a good chance they will double again by July 14. Also, July 14th is 12 days away, which means the UK needs to average just under 16k cases a day for the next two weeks to reach it. This seems highly likely considering the recent surge in cases, as the last reported daily number was 27k. Even if it rises for a few more days before the UK can calm it down, it will very likely happen before July 14th, and if not, almost certainly by months end.

Public Health England says that the number of confirmed cases of the delta variant doubles every 4.5 to 11.5 days. While this is a wide range, we can look at the previous few weeks to get a sense of how fast the number of cases is growing. The last report from June 23 stated that there were over 111,000 cases. Over the past three weeks, the number of delta variants has grown by 46%, 81%, and 223%. The interesting thing to note here is that the percent increase of cases of the delta variant has been decreasing over this time range. This seems to imply that as the delta variant gets more prevalent, the United Kingdom may be taking more actions to prevent the spread of the virus."

If the rate changes it is more likely to increase; more delta cases = more significance, concern and therefore sequencing; I can’t see any reason to reduce the rate at this point, unless they feel they don’t need to sample big numbers for monitoring purposes, and capacity is stretched.

In the week ending June 16, in the ballpark of 47k Delta cases were confirmed, yet only 33.6k (~71%) were added to the figure being forecasted.
