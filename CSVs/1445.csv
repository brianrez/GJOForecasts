Alabama scored 24 points and gave up 6 points in regulation time to Clemson which was averaging 31.2 points per game. Alabama has a superior defense and comparable offense to Georgia. Furthermore, a number of Alabama players have already played in 1 or 2 national championship games and nerves and mistakes will be more likely to impact Georgia. College football is usually a game determined by mistakes and I believe Alabama will commit fewer mistakes. My prediction on the final score is Alabama 28 Georgia 17. Play ball!"

However, a lot of the initial betting odds have OU as the favorite for the spot (or at least have them level to Georgia). I have the two closer to one another than FiveThirtyEight, but I still have Georgia as the slight favorite for the #3 spot due to their higher FPI rating and recent dominant performance in the SEC title game.
