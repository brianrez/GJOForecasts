"Between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018, will an armed group from the Democratic Republic of Congo engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in the Democratic Republic of Congo?",2017-03-31T17:00:53Z,2017-07-01T06:59:53Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],203,654,74,237,"The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (Early Warning Project). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 30 June 2017 and will be resolved in April 2018 after EWP assesses the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from April 2017 to March 2018. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilians fatalities occur in one or more campaigns. See (Early Warning Project) for examples. See (GJ Open) for GJ’s FAQ on forecasting questions like this. Confused?

The most violent and unstable areas in Africa are just to the East of both nations, and the DRC is a popular destination for war refugees. The median age of men and women is about 18 years old and life expectancy is around 55 years of age for both sexes. As we know from insurance rates, males age 18-24 are very likely to engage in high risk behavior. Tribalism is the governing force of the nation and dehumanization and genocide have happened in the DRC in the recent past. In my opinion, most precursors for genocide exist in the DRC. I predict an armed group from within the DRC will systematically kill 1,000 or more civilians within the DRC before April 1, 2018."
