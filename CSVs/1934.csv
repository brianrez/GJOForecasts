Considering the time of year we are in I suspected local/state governments would splurge on a Mirai or some other equipment that is not needed. I found a nice little blog below talking about special deals for California. Bottom line is this. Government money is now spent. The rest of Mirai sales will require people on a budget. Considering historical trends and we are heading into a recession I find it hard to believe the Mirai will make it to 750 unless they cut the prices in half. In which case I'll buy one and forgo my brier score. But I will bring my forecast up to 10% just in case. I will evaluate again once 3Q report comes out.

Depending on your source (http://www.marketplace.org/2016/04/11/world/toyota-makes-case-hydrogen-power or http://cafcp.org/) there are around 13-16 fuelling cells in operation in California at this time, with 6 more due to be operational by July, and 40 by year end. Toyota’s initial estimate of sales in 2016 was 1000 units, but they also expected 48 fuelling stations to be operating by end of 2015, and more to be built in 2016 So for California, taking 13 as a baseline supporting 97 sales, and Toyota deliberately trying to slow down sales at that number, and pre-orders willing to be patient in waiting for delivery (sorry can’t find the link for that but it was from an interview with a Toyota executive), it is not clear why it would make strategic sense now to accelerate the roll out in q2, or why customers would push for faster delivery, so if we assume a small increase on March run-rate, and take another 150 sold by July, this would then imply Toyota would have to stick to their run-rate plans of 1000 units per year ie 500 per half (assuming a straight line delivery which admittedly is a stretch) to achieve the goal of 750, but on a lot fewer stations.
