We've nearly passed 76,000 global cases so I'm shifting my forecast to highest likelihood for # of cases to be in the second range. Most news report indicate that the number of new cases are drooping. However, this Nature article from 10/12 says that the future of Monkeypox is uncertain (potential spread in college campus, people that should be getting tested aren't, vaccines are not readily available everywhere, etc).

I assume that this Response Plan will gradually prove effective in lowering transmission rates further. As such, the most likely option from the current baseline of ~68k infections is that infections will surpass 76k but remain below 88k, with a chance of number of infections going up to 100k people.

By November 21, if the growth rate remains the same, we should still be in the bandwidth between 76,000 and 88,000.

It took around 3 weeks for the number of cases to increase of 6,000 (09/24 to 10/12). And the question closes in around 5 weeks, which is twice the time that it took to increase cases by 6,000.
