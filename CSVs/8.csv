My own intuition is that this sort of battlefield advance is too much to expect from the current pace of UA advance, especially accounting for how slow urban warfare is against an interested defender. That said, often in this war and others one major city falling in a region leads to rapid collapse in that region. So i think this is mostly a case of lots of scenarios where 0 of these cities falls and then a handful of scenarios where more than two fall in a concentrated UA attack/deliberate Russian withdrawal. I haven't looked at the details of these cities on a map yet. Will do that and think about whether i see other scenarios like the Zaphorizhia-oblast general offensive that Texas imagines."

Donetsk is closest to the front line (I think more checking needed) but is a big town that had been under Russian occupation since 2014 and is also the capital of the region annexed by Russia. They will sacrifice a lot to keep it. Some of the others are a long way from the front line and will need some major action get these.
