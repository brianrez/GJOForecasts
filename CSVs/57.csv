There's no reason to believe Kwarteng will go quietly (https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/1580878071506227200), no one in their right mind will want to take over as chancellor, guaranteeing another mess is in the pipeline, and everyone in cabinet is now clear that the PM may fire them for doing what she wanted in the first place, let alone if they don't do what she wants, so the knives will be out ath this point and there isn't even a need to wait for a mistake to be made as that's already been done.Moreover, I don't think Truss has demonstrated the survival instinct that Boris clearly had and won't have anything to fall back on (e.g., ""getting brexit done"" and vaccines).
