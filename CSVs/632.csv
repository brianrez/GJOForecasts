With arguably the best QB in the league and other veteran stalwarts, they hold over a 22 yard per game average on the Cardinals at this point.

Likewise, the Chiefs torched the decent Raiders defense, putting the teams at 414.3 and 414.1 yards per game respectively. The Chargers and Seahawks are still at 400 yards per game and as the season winds down and more games are played, there would need to be bigger shifts in the yardage accumulation to adjust those averages due to denominator increases.

This is significantly above the second place team (Kansas City) who averages 409.0 yards per game. In fact, over the last three games, the Cardinals have averaged over 470 yards per game, which is 60 higher than the next best team over that span (LA Rams). (Source: https://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/stat/yards-per-game) The Cardinals play three more times at home, but also play three games on the road in what could be prohibitive conditions for offenses (Seattle, New England, New York). The Cardinals offense would have to get completely shut down on multiple occasions while another offense would have to light it up for the averages to swing in the favor of another team. The LA Chargers (averaging 20 yards less per game than the Cardinals) are fourth in the league, but run a pass heavy offense which racks of yards due to a) playing from behind and b) garbage time. Their schedule on the way home is a mix of good conditions, poor defenses, and with nothing to play for regarding playoffs and a coach perhaps coaching for his job, they can play loose, despite a rookie quarterback (who is playing much better than expected). KC is in the playoff hunt, but have a challenging schedule coming home and a location where unpredictable weather mean that conduciveness to yardage gains becomes a factor. Seattle has a favorable schedule on the homestretch, but also a challenging location in the Pacific northwest. However, the difference between KC and Seattle is that Seattle's defense is one of the worst in the league and, in order to remain competitive, they must put points on the board and fire on all cylinders offensively to win games. The ""Another Team"" category is led by the Falcons and Packers, but they would need significant offensive performances over the last 6 games to close the gap and it is not looking as likely as the teams mentioned above. However, the gap between the Cardinals and the other NFL teams is rather large for a team to catch them. A major injury could change the assessment, but at this point in the season, the Cardinals are well on their way to claiming this crown."
