So far, the highest number 0f new confirmed cases after 13 February 2021 was 11,809 cases/23 Feb 2021. It seems the bulk of test results of the second half of February 2021 has not yet been fed into reports. I'm thrilled whether there will be a one-off effect of delayed reports, specifically from Houston and Dallas metro area, that could send the TX figures over the threshold of roughly 22,000 new cases on 01 March 2021. https://covidtracking.com/data/state/texas"
