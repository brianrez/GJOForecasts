The Chiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes is suffering from a high sprain ankle injury that clearly affected him during the conference championship game against the Bengals. As well as standout tight end Travis Kelce suffering from a low back injury. I believe that the Eagles defense is going to cause a lot of issue for the offensive of the Chiefs, not allowing Patrick Mahomes the time needed to make the play he normally can make. The Eagles also have the best defensive line and secondary in the league. Which will make it extremely difficult on the Chiefs to keep up with the high scoring, high pace offense of the Eagles."
