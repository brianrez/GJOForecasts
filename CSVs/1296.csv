Giving the example of Venezuela is helpful because Venezuela is from the same region with similar problems to Nicaragua- state run corruption, low economy,issues with law enforcement and daily disrespect of human rights, etc. Despite having different reasons which made both presidents to be seen by (part of) their citizens as illegitimate rulers, it is giving a significant analytical contrast for measuring how possible it is realistically currently Daniel Ortega to cease to be a president of Nicaragua before/after or in similar time with Venezualian President Nicolas Maduro. Moreover, as per today (17th May) Nicaragua seems to be a left out blind spot for the attention of politicians and all international attention of powers such as the US, UK, China, and even EU is consumed by other issues (Brexit, Venezuela, European elections, China, Boeing vs Airbus, etc, etc,) leaving Nicaragua to manage on itself without external pressures. The external pressures are important in measuring to what extent it is possible Ortega to leave his office at any point, not just in July. But with the interest being low in terms of Nicaragua and practically no external pressure except from NGOs, Ortega is in a more or less safe position to not be removed from power before July 2019. Some questions I think someone more proficient in Latin American politics can answer are: 1. Why is Nicaragua less important than Venezuela? 2. Is there any regional framework for cooperation that might influence such decisions and if not- why?"

This reform was put in place as a result of the Sandinista's decade long misuse of funds which left the government insolvent. In addition, President Ortega has take steps over the years to slowly dismantle the country's democracy by stealing elections, reforming the constitution to his benefit, and bribing major media outlets. His actions have left citizens protesting for his removal, and the international community has done the same with the US placing sanctions on the country. Although there have been mass protests by citizens and condemnation by other countries, is is very unlikely that Ortega will cease to be president as he has remained in power unchallenged with the support of the Nicaraguan police and a gang known as the Sandinista Youth."

In doing so, he has managed to keep a hold on his position of power and rule with what many peg as an ""iron fist"". In wake of dialogues from the multiple protests spewing from over the years from human rights violations and economic struggle, President Ortega has agreed to release demonstration protesters who were arrested. As the government creates stricter limitations for opposition, talks have ensued about electoral reform. However, it is likely that President Ortega will remain in his position until after July 2019--potentially until the next election in 2021as he rejected efforts to move it up."

Since July, President Ortega has repeatedly rejected calls for him to step down or to hold early elections. He has instead targeted the anti-government protesters, calling them terrorists. In the past few months, the government has increasingly cracked down on protesters. The movement appears to be dying down as a result of the government's aggressive actions. Furthermore, protesters do not have enough leverage against the President, who over the years has consolidated political power. His wife is the vice president, and they currently have control over the judiciary, parliament, armed forces, and police.

Press accounts list the death toll at over 300 protestors. The attention of the Organization of American States (OAS), of which the U.S. is a permanent member state, has shifted towards Ortega's Nicaragua as international accounts paint a dire picture of a despotic regime. Allegations of human rights violations have drawn the condemnation of the OAS Secretary General. The situation seems to be escalating. Amnesty International now believes it has evidence of extrajudicial killings. Ortega, who assumed power in the 70s after leading a revolution, refuses to transition power after four terms in office. Considering the U.S. history of intervention in Nicaragua in the form of the Contras during the 1980s, and the nations history of violence, there certainly is a quiet potential for internal or external action that could lead to ousting Ortega from office."

The next elections are not due until 2020, so unless there is a threat of violence that would force Ortega out of office, he would likely not be taken out of power until 2020, and that is only if the elections are not rigged in his favor. So there are basically two likely outcomes for the transition of power: either Ortega is forcefully/violently removed from office, like Allende was in Chile through a violent military coup with outside (US) support, which is unlikely since the international community will likely not get involved militarily or through the use of violence; alternatively, if there is enough international pressure, it is possible that Ortega would leave office relatively voluntarily after the 2020 election, as Pinochet did in Chile at the end of the 1980s based on domestic and international concern and protests. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nicaragua-protests-usa/nicaraguas-ortega-rejects-early-elections-u-s-rebukes-crackdown-idUSKBN1KK1OWhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-nicaragua-protests-usa/nicaraguas-ortega-rejects-early-elections-u-s-rebukes-crackdown-idUSKBN1KK1OW https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-08-21/venezuelan-oil-fueled-rise-and-fall-nicaraguas-ortega-regime"

2965,2018-10-04T20:21:37Z,11,[9.0],[5.0],"WASHINGTON—The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued an advisory today to alert U.S. financial institutions of the increasing risk that proceeds of political corruption from Nicaragua may enter or traverse the U.S. financial system. FinCEN expects that senior foreign political figures connected to the regime of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega could react to the perceived threat of further unrest, potential sanctions, or other factors by moving assets out of their accounts in Nicaragua or elsewhere. These assets could be the proceeds of corruption, and they may be directed into U.S. accounts, or laundered through the U.S. financial system. FinCEN requests that financial institutions file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), consistent with their existing Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) obligations, when they identify potential misuse of Nicaraguan public funds or potential proceeds of political corruption associated with senior foreign political figures connected to the Ortega regime. See the press release at https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-advisory-warns-risks-linked-corruption-nicaragua when Maduro falls 25% today in next 12 months then 50% likely thats 12.5% adjusted down 3,5% based on local knowledge 2010-2011 Sandinsitas have experienced helo pilots trained by RU RU copters and neighborhood watch cells that terrorizes middle class lower class since end of Chamorros La Prensa well that is why is is -.3.5"

60541,2018-10-02T21:12:19Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"Based on the history of conflict due to President Ortega, it seems likely that this violence will escalate. President Ortega made changes to the constitution in 2006 in order to stay in office, and despite negative backlash from the public, he continues to fight for power. Since April of 2018, many protesters have died in uprisings calling for Ortega to leave office, and those protests have been met with military force. The protests are composed of people who are multi-ethnic, come from separate political factions as well as economic backgrounds, and the international community has condemned the actions of the government of Nicaragua. Despite condemnation and backlash from thousands of people from the country, Ortega continues to use military and political power to hold his seat. He used his immunity to prevent trial for allegations of child abuse from his step-daughter, and has also shown many other instances of high-level corruption. Because Ortega is willing to go to extremes to remain president and to have this position of power, it is unlikely that he will leave office within one year. Due to the unstable nature and violence insinuated by the protests, it is unlikely that the movement will make an effect until there is a uniting force, which is unlikely before July of 2019. It is unlikely because although businesses have began to feel the effects of the corruption from the presidency, they do not have that much of a voice in Nicaragua because it's one of the poorest countries in Nicaragua. The widespread poverty does not allow for a strong business influence in stopping Ortega, so although they are against Ortega, external influence needs to be implemented. Based off history of international institutions and intervention, in order for them to act, the crisis needs to be more widespread, or national interests of powerful states must be aligned with the politics of Nicaragua. Since the end of the Cold War, the U.S. has not had interests in Nicaragua because the military is no longer aimed at combating communists, but instead terrorists. Other powerful world actors have not indicated interests in Nicaragua either, so it is unlikely there will be an intervention besides sanctions before escalation, which is unlikely to happen until protests become more organized and widespread, which will not happen before July of 2019 due to the chaos in the organization of protests and violence happening currently."
