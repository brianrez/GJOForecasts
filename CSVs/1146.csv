Still, i died on this one too, @Anneinak, and agree with your analysis. There's a down-side to using an error-squared approach to calculating results: the occasional question where the forecaster and/or the crowd/median get it wrong dominates the scoreboard. Being 10% or 30% off the mark when the crowd is 20% off makes next to no difference, but being 90% or 70% off when the crowd is 80% sure does! I haven't done the math but imagine that forecasting conservatively (closer to 50% than the true probability) would pay off greatly in the long run because it's the questions with the low-probability outcome - like this one - which dominate. I've not encountered error-squared evaluation before. Root-mean-square and mean-average-error are often used for evaluating forecasts for weather, e.g., tornados or solar power; perhaps they would give less punishing/lucky results for this game."

Assuming that it is, I think I will have done better than I should have done if I had estimated base rate probabilities correctly. My statistical model uses base rates (in the form of historical daily movements) to build distributions for the eventual price level. However, this model assumes that volatility remains constant at its historical average. In reality, volatility varies. In particular, high volatility tends to follow high volatility. In other words, volatility is clustered. That is why economists use GARCH modeling which varies the volatility accordingly. In the case of the FTSE, the level dropped and stayed below the 4 April level, which led my model to assign a relatively high probability of 'no'. However, ideally my model would have used GARCH volatility to account for the fact that the FTSE could have easily bounced back up above the 4 April level."
