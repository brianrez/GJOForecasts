Rothenberg and Gonzales think 219 seats are safe for Republicans, essentially giving the Democrats close to a 0% chance of taking the House.

In the current environment Dem motivation is lower than 2008 or 2012, based on primary attendance, and does not appear to shift in the face of a likely Clinton nomination. The one X-factor is the nomination of a Trump candidate with an equally polarizing VP pick. A moderate (i.e. Kaisch-like pick) is likely to blunt any spike in Dem motivation in the 2016 election, which results in Repubs retaining control of the House."

Today, rates of split-ticket voting are at all-time lows and House candidates are defined by their party and the top of the ticket more than ever. ... Right now, we rate only 31 Republican seats as at risk, meaning Democrats would need to win an impossibly high 97 percent of them - and hold all their own seats - to take back control. But filing deadlines still haven't passed in a majority of districts, and it's worth watching how many more Democratic recruits Trump and Cruz will entice in the coming months."""

Trump is bringing out the crowd which includes a lot of people not normally engaged in politics and Hillary is the opposite. She cannot get her supporters to do anything more than clap lamely while listening to her canned speeches. This will translate down-ballot very heavily. The only thing that will hold back the Republicans will be their efforts to distance themselves from Trump up until the end when they see the polls in their direction.

You have to line up on one end of the political spectrum, or the other. You need to have high ratings from the watchdog groups that focus on issues that are important in your district. State Legislatures have supported this game by gerrymandering most of the districts in the country. This makes things convenient for fund raising and vote getting. Senators run state-wide, but House members run district-by-district, Sure, trouble in the Presidential race can have an impact down ballot. But if you vote in a typical House district, it would be very difficult for you to give up on every special interest issue that has been near and dear to your heart. Chances are, your representative has earned top roll call scores from all of your favorite special interest groups. He or she has been proven to vote the way you think. You're not going to vote for someone else. This is what makes it so difficult to shift a majority in the House."
