The plebiscite did not approve the peace agreement ( CNN, BBC, The City Paper, Wall Street Journal). In late August, Colombia and the FARC signed a deal to end the FARC's decades-long armed rebellion (Reuters, BBC).

Winning approval requires that a simple majority vote ""yes"" on the plebiscite question (Reuters) and that the majority represent at least 13% of registered voters (Wall Street Journal, Colombia Calls). President Juan Manuel Santos supports the agreement while his chief rival, former President Alvaro Uribe, is campaigning for its rejection (Washington Post).

This is obviously anecdotal and a bit of a generalization, but from my time and experience in Colombia, people are ready to put the 80's and 90's to sleep for good. Unless some sort of public attack or significant kidnapping by ELN or some fringe narco- elements of FARC positioning for post-plebiscite control of former FARC revenue streams occurs, I don't see this being voted down. And after just glancing at the graph/ stats on this forecast I see I'm probably not telling other forecasters anything they don't already believe http://www.economist.com/news/21707728-scenes-colombian-guerrillas-last-conference-armed-group-farc-agree-hand http://en.mercopress.com/2016/09/26/land-distribution-remains-challenge-for-the-post-peace-accord-in-colombia https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-08-26/waging-peace-in-colombia http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0489xkc"
