But also the Democrats have to persuade all 50 members to vote for her. Something they’ve been struggling with. Also 1 May is only 6 weeks away now so time is starting to run out for the question.

Problems within the democratic party over this candidate look unlikely given the upcoming midterm elections, the stakes might be too high for dissent, even with Manchin. Republicans might not see it as worthwile to make take their issues with the process or the candidate herself to the centre stage, since there are more easily digestable narratives to attack their political opponents with. In this time during Joe Biden's presidency it is also unlikely that calls for a delay to a next term would emerge."

The time from start of judiciary committee hearings to confirmation by the Senate for the past 7 justices have all been <41 days. The longest was Kagan at 38. From a scheduling perspective 41 days is plenty of time, and Dick Durbin who chairs the Judiciary Committee has said there's ""no reason to wait or delay"" (https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-set-judge-jacksons-confirmation-hearings-march-21/story?id=83207791). The average time from nomination to start of hearings since Roberts is 41 days, and Jackson's wait was only 21, so he seems to be making good on that promise. Barring Durbin scheduling the Judiciary Committee vote super late for some reason, there shouldn't be an issue with timing."
