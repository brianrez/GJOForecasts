Overlaying this with the various events shaping French politics internally and abroad (again, loosely) during these periods we can see Le Pen's appeal to appear in the final (i.e. 2nd) round (not necessarily winning) being more possible than not (but not by much) once more (and likely only once more if defeated again)."
