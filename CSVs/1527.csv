Found out that the latest figure is 116 in week 42 (2017) but there is no clear trend curve in any direction. Then I downloaded previous year's charts and in 2016 in week 46 the number has been 139 and 2015 it was 576 and 2014 it has been 33. So I came up with a resolution that the scope of epidemic is extremely hard to forecast, but I will base my estimation on the fact that 2014 was a massive outbreak. the trend should be decreasing, if there are any lessons learned. In addition Qatar is vaccinating people long before the outbreak."

I then took the lower probability values and prorated them to the other bins. I will update later based on further evidence and analysis.

There are some clues - Australia and New Zealand have had a bad year, due to a strain not covered by the annual vaccination, so the Northern Hemisphere is bracing for the worst (even though the vaccination has been reformulated). Although Qatar does not have a cold ""winter"" as such, the change in weather starting from November does lead to increased respiratory problems, so there could be a seasonal increase in cases. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/12/nhs-fears-worst-flu-season-history/ https://www.statnews.com/2017/10/16/flu-virus-severity/"
