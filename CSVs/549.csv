Given that he was the vice president in Obama’s administration and that 95% of Biden’s Cabinet picks have prior government experience, compared to 32% of Trump’s team having no such experience, the inference being that Biden would unravel much of Trump’s tumultuous trade actions of withdrawing from the TPP and/or engaging with the CPTPP. Biden’s administration has however, maintained Trump’s trade policies, perhaps due to counter China’s actions in Hong Kong, Taiwan and to a lesser extent on the border with India. Biden’s cabinet would appear to prefer bilateral trade deals with Japan and Taiwan to counter the Chinese interest in the CPTPP."

The reduction in tariffs would help domestic businesses. I could see a situation where the the COVID stimulus package fails and many turn to a free trade agreement to stimulate the economy. Also, an escalation of the China-USA tension may cause the US to seek the tactical benefits of closer relationships with China’s neighbours.

Additionally, President Biden has made supporting the American middle class a central feature of his foreign policy.[1] Most credible, independent analysis of the CPTPP find it would lead to U.S. job losses in manufacturing while modestly increasing GDP and overall employment through increases in the agriculture and services sector. Manufacturing jobs in export-oriented companies are the holy grail of middle class prosperity, since they pay well above average for low-skilled workers, something that the new administration is not likely to treat lightly."
