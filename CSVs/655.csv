De acuerdo al simulador de Reuters, recién para Octubre de 2021 toda la población estadounidense habría recibido la 2da dosis. Esto deja un margen muy cerrado para que la economía alcance a recuperarse durante este año. Por otro lado, tenemos la relación de EEUU con China. Ya que, por un lado, el gigánte asiático, que pareciera haber controlado completamente la pandemia, es un gran consumidor de Iphones, lo que podría considerarse una buena noticia para Apple.

I have not been able to unpack whether the models released in those years corresponded to models with significant feature upgrades. I am going to make an educated guess and say that is probably true - happy to be corrected :-). That would point to the first 5G IPhone causing a similar spike. The complicating factor of course is COVID. However even with the COVID hit in FY 2020 there was only a 3% hit to sales - it wasn't catastrophic. If we had a similar hit next year, but the ~say 10% boost from the new model (it was 18% in FY 2018), we would still be ~4% above FY2019. I see that as a decent margin of error. Regarding the probability estimate I would say I am confident it is greater than 60-40, but not as high as 90-10. Something around 70-30, and 80-20 seems right. Because of the small risk of supply disruption I will go for the lower value"

Apple is seeing an increase in tablet and laptop sales due to the pandemic. THe 2019 levels were among its lowest since 2014, so the bar is not as high as it has previously been but all signs point to a disappointing sales number."

The 2020 report says ""iPhone net sales decreased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to the absence of new iPhone models in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the introduction of iPhone SE in the third quarter of 2020."""

Most phones are sold in China and I believe the trade wars between the US and China will affect sales. FOXCONN, the largest manufacturer of Iphones has begun to diversify its portfolio because they are expecting sales of the iPhone to slow."

More models will allow apple to reach more consumers (but possibly hurt margins). 2) FY 2021 will hopefully see fewer lockdowns than 2020. Also, I expect FY2020 caused a lot of people to defer upgrading or purchasing a new iPhone. This might push people to upgrade in FY2021. 3) Exchange rates and sales in developing countries will be something to monitor into the future. IMO, this is not an important factor impacting sales in FY2021."
