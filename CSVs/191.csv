But since it appears the ""United States has seemingly added Ukraine’s sustainment to its other entitlement programs"", Ukraine won't run out of materiel resources either. So how will the war end?

And, in my estimate, the conditions far actually starting negotiations haven't fundamentally changed in regard of both conflict parties being so far of accepting the conditions of the other set for even starting any talks. Seems like the Ukrainians are getting slowly the initative in the conflict, so their likely less willing to join the table with the Russians, and for the Russian Government, well ... I think they are sectretly regreting the whole invasion and would like to get over it. The problem here is, as I see it, they have to sell an agreement to the Russian people and that it was worth it. I can't see any common ground where might be able to meet and finally agree on anything in a face saving manner for both sides. And in the description above it is mentioned, that it has to be the EU recognized government of Ukraine, so even in the more and more unlikely case the Russians manage it somehow to install their puppets in Kyiv, that would not count. And in my estimate, at the moment at least, it is even less likely that Putin would agree into any agreement, which he hasn't written by himself. So that would leave only the option that somebody else would have to take the power in Russia, which I estimate also really low in propability, and then the new leader of Russia must be complete ignorant of History how WW1 ended for Russia in 1917 and it's aftermath. And that all assuming that a power transfer in Russia from Putin to whomever goes quick and smooth without any infighting and struggles between various potential successors and their factions. And all this still within this calender year? As more I think about all this, as more and more unreasonably generous this even remote 1% possibility appears to me."

Most probable outcome in the near term is stalemate as Ukrainian forces generally lack the sorts of brekatrhough weapons including air power that would be required to take back substantive territory as has recently been shown in Kherson front. Stalemate outcomes are historically very difficult to resolve through negotiation when they involve territory - this has been true between Israel and Syria (no final status agreement) India and Pakistan and Ukraine and Russia since 2014.

Collapse in Russian economy or military supply chains? Massive losses by Russia during a future incompetent assault? China withdrawing support for Putin after some new atrocity comes to light? A much more lethal version of COVID? Mutiny in senior Russian leadership? If “it” happens, it’s probably not going to be on the list of scenarios above, but just because I can’t foresee it doesn’t mean it’s not possible in a situation as complex and as “lose-lose” as this. It’s literally in everyone’s interest (except Putin’s) to stop this insane war."

In the last 50 years, 4/24 *completed* conflicts terminated in under 7 months (the time from the moment of my forecast to the final timeline of the question). Of the last 10 conflicts, only 2 completed within that timeline. This leads me to believe that the war is likely to drag on past 1 Dec 2022. If I include *ongoing* conflicts (excluding Russia-Ukraine), just 4/39 have completed within that timeline in the last 50 years, and only 1/10 of the last 10 conflicts have completed within that timeline."

New generals won't have the time to be efficient in battle, especially with new inexperienced young draftees. Plus, such a situation at the Kremlin will lead to making even more mistakes. The war is very costly, Russia won't be able to afford it for much longer. On the Ukrainian side, Zelensky's leadership and communication skills will gain even more support from the West/EU/NATO."

I am giving a 20% that October particularly will be a bad month for Russia. Putin has run his kleptocracy through corruption and violence.
