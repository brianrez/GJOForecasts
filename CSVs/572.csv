Past disappearances from public life by prominent figures usually end up the same way: a reappearance in public after many weeks or months with abject confessions and apologies by the prominent person, followed by enormous fines or a jail sentence or both. Jack Ma's attempts to move into financial services with his already gigantic market dominance with Alipay and his outspoken criticism of the CCP have likely cost him the ability to make Ant Group anything other than a payment processing firm due to the antitrust investigation launched as Ma disappeared from public.[1] His criticism of the CCP's monopoly on political power will likely be even more catastrophic for Ma personally in terms of his wallet and personal freedom."
