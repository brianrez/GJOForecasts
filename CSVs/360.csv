Supply chain issues with goods and materials originating in China persist, but catastrophic problems due to the energy situation in China (e.g., with magnesium) have been avoided. I see that at least some solar panel suppliers in Dubai have plentiful supplies of solar panels, but prices have been going up worldwide, and as with everything, there is a demand curve that is surely not completely price inelastic. https://qz.com/2081333/supply-chain-chaos-threatens-the-growth-of-solar-energy/ I'm hedging slightly higher primarily because of uncertainty, but staying low because of increasing costs and supply chain issues. If it weren't for the Pandemic, I think it's very likely that growth in MW under the Shams Dubai program would have been larger than it has been so far this year, and I think it's extremely likely they would make it to 400MW by the end of the year. With all the economic dislocations of the pandemic, I think it will be very close (maybe even 395 to 399MW!), but I suspect that they won't quite reach 400MW, with the the slowdown in growth (relative to what it would have been like without the pandemic) likely increasing through Q4, commensurate with increasing global solar panel costs, materials costs, and shipping costs."
