Will legislation removing the individual mandate to purchase health insurance be signed before 30 April 2017?,2016-12-27T18:00:04Z,2017-04-29T17:00:14Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']","['Business', 'Health', 'US Politics']",2503,654,1052,237,"The individual mandate is a part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA, or Obamacare) that requires most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty. Republicans have tried to repeal the ACA many times since it was passed in 2010, but with control of Congress and the presidency they now have the opportunity to act on President-elect Trump's promise to repeal the individual mandate or ACA in its entirety (NPR, CNBC, CNN, The Bureau of National Affairs). The passage of legislation which prohibits the use of federal funds to enforce the provisions of the individual mandate would resolve the question as ""yes"" (Legal Information Institute). Confused?

I have to remind myself we are talking about the mandate for this question not ACA in general, but the mandate is a pivot point to the legislation and is what keeps insurers even interested in offering coverage.

In addition, he also now seems to be intimating that while the repeal may be in one fell swoop, the replacement components may be crafted in some sort of piecemeal fashion thereafter. This interpretation is a major change in my thinking in that it removes the problematic necessity of having a complete set of alternatives available at the time of repeal. This also seems to be a change in direction from the path that I had previously interpreted Paul Ryan to be on (repeal and replacement simultaneously). This is at least how I interpret the comments from Spicer in his 22 February press conference. So, will the first of two budget reconciliation packages occur before 30 April, and, if so, will it contain a repeal of the relevant Obamacare provision? My current thinking is 30% on the first question and 50% on the second, thus increasing my current forecast +5 (from 10 to 15)."

1333,2017-01-23T21:15:53Z,6,[99.0],[0.0],"Affordable Care Act Friday’s third executive order, which concerned the Affordable Care Act, gave broad authority to the head of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as the heads of other executive offices and governmental departments, “to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.” The order’s immediate effects are difficult to assess, but it does appear that the individual mandate at the core of the law is the target. No specific action was directed as a result of the order."

4645,2017-01-23T18:22:23Z,6,[51.0],[-41.0],"Contra many of the comments on this question so far, the ball isn't really in Pres. Trump's court. So any bets about whether or not legislation will be signed (Pres. Trump is almost certain to sign such a bill) are actually bets about whether Congress will pass such legislation prior to the end of the hundred days. However, it seems as though Congressional Republicans are only just now engaging with the questions of how this will affect the country, and how to mitigate damage with a more conservative approach. That increases my degree of uncertainty about their ability to pass such legislation. There aren't any meaningful, hard time constraints. Presently, I feel very confidently that they'll repeal the individual mandate within Pres. Trump's first term, but much less so that they'll accomplish it within the first hundred days without an actual institutional constraint. To formalize this, I'll assign a .99 probability to a legislative dismantling of the ACA within Trump's first term. If we break that term into three-month blocks (resembling the roughly three months between now and the end of the hundred days), Congress has 16 discrete time steps in which to pass a repeal. If we treat repeal as an independent event occurring in one of the blocks, each one has a roughly 25% of seeing the repeal. Moreover, Congress' incentive to pass a repeal will follow a U-shaped curve over time: as we move away from the inauguration, doing it soon will seem less important. However, as we approach the 2020 election, it will become considerably more urgent. If it appears that congressional Republicans begin coalescing around a single plan, either to replace or simply to repeal and then figure out what to build in its place (or do nothing), I will scrap this model in favor of one which more closely matches my internal assessment of their determination to actually repeal the law."

Trump being the ""so called"" businessman he is already has mandated payers into the system. If he is looking at this as a business why would any business strip this mandate (law) to change the act? You would lose payers (client's) and the core way to monetize his new health care act. I can see him repealing and replacing other parts but there is now way he is going to harm the current individual mandated (law) marketplace. It would just undermine his brand and who he has been throughout his professional life!"

Before ACA women paid more (up to 50% more). 3) ACA added coverage for: treatment for addiction (to 30% of uninsured policies), and mental health (added to 20% of non covered policies). 4) Before ACA 50% of employer health plans capped annual and lifetime payments, many between 1 and 2 million. Mini med plans were often capped at a few thousand dollars per year.

32439,2017-01-11T18:28:52Z,1,[60.0],[60.0],Because it should be each americans responsability to chose if they want health care or not and therefore purchase it if they desire
32427,2017-01-11T17:51:56Z,1,[60.0],[60.0],I feel that Trump will remove health care. He was extremely against Obama care because people were using it for the wrong reasons. Trump will not deal with lazy people. Everyone should get a job and have health insurance.
32437,2017-01-11T17:18:04Z,1,[55.0],[55.0],It's tough to say. If the system is totally torn apart it could make a very big problem. So maybe later then the first 100 days something will be worked out but most likely not within the first 100.
32434,2017-01-11T17:06:18Z,1,[13.0],[13.0],I do not think this is likely because it is challenging to get such a large bill passed within 100 days.

32432,2017-01-11T16:23:54Z,1,[15.0],[15.0],I don't think that this will be signed this early because it is too big and too in-depth to argue over in a period of 100 days. It going to eventually be taken car of.
32429,2017-01-11T16:22:42Z,1,[60.0],[60.0],I think they will remove because most Republicans don't agree with any part of it. But Trump is not totally against Obamacare he has said he would maybe just change it to his and the Republicans.

32413,2017-01-11T14:28:03Z,1,[30.0],[30.0],This is unlikely to happen because Obama care is a huge thing around the world. There is too many people on it and they won't just take it away. If he took it away so many people would get screwed over.
32418,2017-01-11T14:27:30Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],"This is highly unlikely. There are way too many people relying on the ACA at the moment. Changing these regulations could, and most likely will, make it difficult for a lot of people to get the medical help they need."

This would make the entire ACA untenable, and while this is the goal of the Republicans, the shock would be too immense and immediately drop coverage from millions."
32383,2017-01-11T13:59:50Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],I think that Obama Care will be done with by sometime at the end of this year. It will be interesting to see how this effects our economy.

32391,2017-01-11T04:07:39Z,1,[79.0],[79.0],I do believe that legislation will begin signing the removal of Obamacare but not be completed before April 30th. Although in the future they will for sure. This is because ACA is a terrible thing. It forces everyone to buy health insurance or pay a penalty. This brings huge dollars to those running the insurance and sucks the money out of the hard working Americans. This can not happen anymore and Trump will fix that.
32283,2017-01-11T04:04:38Z,1,[91.0],[91.0],"Obama care must go, i believe Trump will work hard on a new plan health service."
32379,2017-01-11T03:53:21Z,1,[85.0],[85.0],Yes. There will be legislation removing the individual mandate to purchase health insurance before 30 April 2017. This issue has been a central speaking point of President elect Trump's campaign. Prior to the election Republicans in the House and Senate were opposed to Obamacare. Now that the Republicans control both the House and the Senate this will be one of the first items that is brought before President Trump.
32366,2017-01-11T03:50:33Z,1,[88.0],[88.0],Trump has been talking about how much he hates obama care and its very likely its gonna be one of the first things he does.

32390,2017-01-11T03:34:43Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],"Yes, I believe legislation will remove the health care mandate before April 30th because of Donald's basic disgust towards the act & the fact that republicans (who also disagree with the mandate) are the majority right now."
32386,2017-01-11T03:31:32Z,1,[90.0],[90.0],I feel very strongly that this will happen as Trump is not in favor of Obama Care and will want to get rid of this right away. This will most likely be one of his first acts as President.
32389,2017-01-11T03:24:39Z,1,[60.0],[60.0],This has a high likelihood of being removed because Trump is very against Obamacare and such things. He's very against paying extra for your own health insurance just so someone else can have it. Trump takes a strong dislike for this as a businessman.
32388,2017-01-11T03:15:08Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],I think that removing Obamacare is going to be one of the very first things that Trump tries to get done.
32385,2017-01-11T03:11:17Z,1,[90.0],[90.0],"I think one of the first actions Trump will take will be to repeal all aspects of ObamaCare. It is against the republican platform to force a plan onto the public. Also, Trump has made his feelings on the ACA very clear as a waste of money and time to enforce. Trump will repeal and replace it as would any republican candidate."
32387,2017-01-11T03:11:07Z,1,[63.0],[63.0],"I believe that legislation removing the mandate to purchase health insurance will be signed before April 30, 2017 because many citizens now are frustrated with their health insurance and they are not receiving the befits they would like. Many are paying very high deductibles and feel that it would better suite them to not have insurance at all and just pay up front because they are very healthy and don't go to the doctors a lot."
32381,2017-01-11T02:57:30Z,1,[25.0],[25.0],I think chances are slim because there is a lot of work to be done to replace Obamacare before it is close to being repealed.
32384,2017-01-11T02:56:34Z,1,[50.0],[50.0],The government shouldn't force people to have health insurance but there is a chance that they will continue to. I'm unsure.
32382,2017-01-11T02:54:49Z,1,[30.0],[30.0],they have been trying to repeal the act since 2010 so i dont think it will happenw ithin the first 100 days
32380,2017-01-11T02:53:54Z,1,[65.0],[65.0],"Yes, because republicans like Trump want to get rid of ObamaCare."
32353,2017-01-11T02:50:29Z,1,[69.0],[69.0],"Yes, mainly because it does not work very well and not many people use it the way it was intended to be used."
32378,2017-01-11T02:50:23Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],"Trump wanted to get rid of this and republicans did not care for it, and he expressed his opinion on ObamaCare,"
32373,2017-01-11T02:40:15Z,1,[79.0],[79.0],"Trump and many other republicans have expressed extreme dislike for this plan, and I'm sure with the President Elect's new power, the removal of ""obama-care"" will certainly be one of Trump's first moves. The mindset of this being that ""why should I pay extra for my health care, just to pay for a stranger's health care which they can't afford."""
32376,2017-01-11T02:30:09Z,1,[60.0],[60.0],I am making this forecast because i believe that they can do this because it's there first objective in the white house is to get rid of obamacare and they can make it happen.
32372,2017-01-11T02:25:57Z,1,[85.0],[85.0],Yes because this was a very big reason why he wanted to become the president and to help the people of the US.
32374,2017-01-11T02:24:47Z,1,[65.0],[65.0],"I said yes at 65% because it only says if it will be signed by April 30, it never says take action. I believe the signing of it will occur before April 30, but a new plan of health insurance will not. Also, a lot of the legislative branch agrees with Trump on this issue."
32284,2017-01-11T02:14:35Z,1,[95.0],[95.0],"Yes because Trump views this law as unconstitutional, as this was the main reasons he was voted into office."
32369,2017-01-11T02:11:23Z,1,[10.0],[10.0],He will try to reduce it I feel like but then not want to use the money because it's to much.
32370,2017-01-11T02:06:39Z,1,[76.0],[76.0],I think this because it was not made correctly in the first place. Trump has also stated how he feels about it and how he wants to get rid of it. When he will do this and where it is on his agenda is unknown making my percent lower.
32364,2017-01-11T01:52:02Z,1,[95.0],[95.0],The senate has been wanting to get rid of it because it was never properly developed
32175,2017-01-11T01:46:25Z,1,[50.0],[50.0],"Trump has publically stated his opinion of ObamaCare and how he will repeal it. But, he is not changing/getting rid of it altogether, so he might not follow through with what he said."
32367,2017-01-11T01:45:13Z,1,[65.0],[65.0],No. It will take longer that time period to fix Obama care or replace it.
32251,2017-01-11T01:36:35Z,1,[50.0],[50.0],I think it could be possible that legislation removing the individual mandate to purchase health insurance be signed before April 30th. The reason is because Donald Trump wants to remove it and about half of the legislative branch agrees with his decision.
32365,2017-01-11T01:35:49Z,1,[85.0],[85.0],Donald Trump will repeal The Affordable Care Act

However, I do not believe this is of high priority compared to other important things such as national security, allies, and trading deals."
32349,2017-01-11T01:15:41Z,3,[75.0],[0.0],yes because trump will have the power to repeal this
32357,2017-01-11T01:12:10Z,1,[80.0],[80.0],It is one of the top few things that president-elect Trump wanted to replace. With the support of congress and the people it will be replaced to a hopefully better healthcare system.
32306,2017-01-11T01:11:04Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],"There are more republicans in the Senate to push them through. There are Democrats that are fighting to keep the ACA in place or at least a replacement prior to repealing, therefore I think that he will follow through with this."
32361,2017-01-11T01:10:01Z,1,[70.0],[70.0],Yes I think that this will happen because the republicans are pushing for it but I do not believe that it will happen within the first 100 days

32360,2017-01-11T00:57:47Z,1,[89.0],[89.0],Yes legislation will remove this the republicans support the removal whereas the democrats don't causing a big rift between the two. As well as the fact that people are abusing the system and therefore it will be removed to prevent further abuse.
32349,2017-01-11T00:38:07Z,2,[75.0],[0.0],it has been not able to be repealed until recently because of the President elect. They will use trumps power to repeal it

32331,2017-01-10T23:56:42Z,1,[85.0],[85.0],"Repealing ""Obamacare"" is one of the top priorities of a Republican controlled congress as well as the new President's priority. This priority will be met with fierce opposition from Democrats. Republicans will have to be able to work with Democrats to come up with a different healthcare plan that is more appealing then Obama care. Therefore it will be more difficult to come up with a better plan immediately."
32354,2017-01-10T23:49:47Z,1,[25.0],[25.0],I know Trump felt very strongly on this but I feel if he does do this it won't be finished within the first 100 days

32350,2017-01-10T23:23:11Z,1,[65.0],[65.0],I believe that Trump wishes to remove the individual mandate to purchase health insurance because ever since Obamacare was enacted many people have been taking advantage of it and it has simply been costing too much money that people are not working hard to earn.
32347,2017-01-10T23:04:18Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],Yes i think that it this is one of the really strong arguments that Trump made so he will feel obligated to follow through.
32346,2017-01-10T22:42:03Z,1,[50.0],[50.0],"Yes I do believe that they will remove Obamacare because there are people that take advantage of it and use it in the wrong way, but there are also people that actually need it.

Ironically, many individuals who rely on Affordable HealthCare from the lower-income, high unemployment areas that ended up voting for Trump and other GOP candidates elected the officials who wish to repeal it.

(B) purchase private coverage, (C) have coverage provided by an employer. (D) eligibility for coverage under Medicaid. By not having any of the (4) options for coverage a tax penalty is applied to the non-insured tax payer. Legislation before April 30 is not necessary because, (A) the elimination of the tax penalty will not apply until April 15, 2018. (B) until a viable replacement of the Individual Mandate to pay cost to support ACA, it's highly unlikely Congress will provide a replacement by April 30, 2017. Congress has no detailed plans, or has been working on any detailed plans that are publicly known that will replace the Individual Mandate. Additionally, the Individual Shared Responsibility (Payment) Tax, is a tax, it does not require a full overhaul to remove by Congress, however, for this reason, it is less likely that Congress will attempt to remove the tax by April 30, 2017. Members of Congress will want to highlight the fact that the Tax Penalty is removed via members of Congress, in both houses, supported and voted for this removal of the tax penalty. In this, they will want to receive credit during re-election efforts. For this, it is not likely Congress will remove the tax penalty before April 30, 2017. Member of Congress that supported this bill, if passed, and signed by the president, will want voters to remember this Congressional action. Doing this, so early, will be forgotten by primaries in 2018 and general elections November 2018. Also, if legislation is to occur via Congress, it doesn't need to occur in the first 100 days, due to compromise on other Congressional legislation. It is key to note, that President Trump first 100 days, does not mean any legislation must be passed by Congress. Legislation is not fast food, it takes awhile to prepare."

Sponsors of the repeal legislation used a provision of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 called reconciliation that allows for expedited consideration of such legislation. Speaker Ryan has suggested use of the process again to minimize Democratic resistance to the passage of the legislation. All twenty four times a reconciliation bill has been attempted it has been successful, though in 4 cases the President vetoed the Bill. The time for a reconciliation bill to wind its way through Congress ranges from 27 days to 384 days, with an average of 155 days. The 2015 Bill took 248 days.

No change inforecast. 3 Jan: Some discussion about impact of repeal without replacement in place. Appears to be some concern among Republicans. However, the feeling still seems to be that certain key parts will be repealed immediately as symbolic gesture if nothing else, and the individual mandate likely falls in this category.

In addition, since there will be limited direct consequences until the next signup period, this step will be relatively costless for the new administration and thus more likely to be taken.
