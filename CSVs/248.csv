My math before expected a peak of 23k, but the average might end up. being a bit lower based on averaging the days around it, and my model's curve didn't have a slowed growth at the end as I was just looking for the peak at the current rate. I'm adjusting my prediction down a bit to put 10-20k as the most likely. I think the chances that we cross 10k are still really good (>68%) but we'll find out in the next few days based on how the growth rate slows . The growth rate has also slowed down from 25% to ~20%, which might suggest we're closer to the peak than I had thought. I'd expect the peak of this wave to hit sometime between Feb 28 and March 5.

Estimating the current outbreak on what happened with previous outbreaks will not be a good comparison as the previous ones were stopped or slowed with severe restrictions of movement as the country was shut down. NZs restrictions for this outbreak have been reduced to occupancy limits, vaccination requirements, contact tracing, mask use, etc. I would comment that these restrictions are only loosely followed apart from the cancellation of major events that could have been superspreader events. https://covid19.govt.nz/traffic-lights/life-at-red/ The other big advantage is that NZ is currently in summer and the population is all outdoors."

In the UK, the highest rate reached was ~2700 cases/million per day. For New Zealand's population of ~5 million, that translates to around 13,500 cases. However, Sweden and Denmark have both registered even higher case numbers on a per million basis, which would translate to 20,000 and 35,000 NZ cases respectively."

Cases are currently rising (c250 a day now) even before international travel rules are relaxed. New Zealand has a high vaccination rate and mask adoption but this does not seem to stop Omicron spreading (but does reduce hospitalisation). To exceed bin one, a 7x rise in cases is needed. Other countries saw a 5x (UK, Sweden) to 10x (France, South Africa) rise due to Omicron in a month or less. On this basis it certainly seems possible that cases could rise above bin 1 if behaviour is unchecked.
