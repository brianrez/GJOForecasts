The question isn't whether things are better or worse on March 31 vs. today. It's whether they are better or worse than March 30. With this in mind, there is incredible uncertainty here.

The more people get vaccinated and the more these deviate from the regular recommendations of hygiene and safety measures (mask-wearing in particular), the more avoidable transmission from vaccinated individuals to others will be observed as long as not more than, say, 40% of the total population has received at least one shot (and natural immunization by an overcome infection is included), which could spark a fourth surge of the virus across the U.S. in late February 2021 and bring up the r(t) figures up in several states again which see a currently low r(t) figure due to a recent massive drop in infections."
