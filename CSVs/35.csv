With the most major vote that close, I think a deal will likely be reached. The Biden administration is not yet intervening. My understanding from the article below is that the unions and railroads are going to meet first; perhaps if those talks fail, then the Secretary of Labor will get involved. I think Congress would get involved only as a last resort. I think things won't come to the point of a strike, because labor currently has the upper hand; I think the unions will get a few more concessions, and a deal will be struck. So I don't think it's likely that things will even reach a point where Congress will intervene."

Additionally, with Mid-terms and a looming 2024 presidential race, the Democrats seems to be in a “whatever it takes” mode to keep things moving, with inflation at cycle high’s and with it being the top issued that Americans are concerned about, Democrats cannot afford any more political losses in the economy. From the more inside view, there were already talks and a deal has been agreed to in theory, highly increases the chance that a strike does not occur. Even if a strike does occur because the deal doesn’t go through, there are likely weeks and months of threats and re-negotiations that will occur before a strike begins."

Until I see clearer ways out, I'm going to favor a YES for strike in 2022. Would be higher if not for the historical data pointing to no and the crowd consensus being low."
