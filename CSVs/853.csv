Turnout of 2,504 is the highest on record so far and might contain some of the positive tests which have, for technical reasons, not been reported on 07 June 2020 through 09 June 2020. After reconciliation of daily test attribution, there's a more consistent picture: 19,233 of the tests as of 09 June 2020 have been re-attributed to 08 June. The most striking point: Daily positivity rate hit 18.2% as of 10 June 2020 (2,504 positives out of 13,732 new tests), as tests/testing kits have obviously been very scarce in TX lately and too many infections have remained undetected for too long; this opens up likely paths for possible new gloomy scenarios on the high end. Each of today's confirmed case will have worked, traveled and gathered for two to three days and set free a tiny avalanche of new infections in a chain reaction. Therefore, re-re-adjusting to 100%."

We then have a slowly declining plateau, as testing numbers continue to climb rapidly, but new cases (either new infections, or stragglers from the initial outbreak) get harder and harder to find. The plateau oscillates quite a bit, which I think is a combination of 1) day to day randomness in testing and infections, and 2) the fact that each large outbreak is an ensemble of smaller city- and town-level outbreaks, each of which probably look more like your classic logistic/epidemic curve."
