Will the United States experience two consecutive quarters of a negative real GDP growth rate in 2019?,2019-01-04T22:00:21Z,2019-12-20T17:00:26Z,No,"['Yes', 'No']",['Economic Indicators'],3077,654,2034,237,"The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis releases three estimates for each quarter: advance, second, and third, and the release dates for 2019 can be found here: The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. This question will be resolved based on the third estimates for Q1, Q2, and Q3, typically released 3 months after the end of each quarter, and the advance estimate for Q4, expected in mid-January 2020. The third estimate for Q3 2018 indicated that real GDP increased at an annual rate of 3.4 percent: The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Inside view: most economists predict continued slow growth: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/second-quarter-us-gdp-left-at-2-downshifting-economy-unlikely-to-rev-up-soon-2019-09-26 Outside view: charts available at https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/united-states/real-gdp-growth show there is a long term decline in growth (it hasn't gone past 5% since 2000). But the chart never goes from over 2% in one quarter to less than 0 in the next - it would be more of a gradual dip that continues below zero. So I put chance of negative growth in Q3 at 5%. From the historical data since 1948, a first quarter of negative growth is followed by a second quarter of negative growth 37.5% of the time. So the combined probability of Q3 and Q4 being negative would be 5% * 37.5%, or 1.875%."

There are serious headwinds which may cause a slowdown or even a recession, such as the hit to business confidence and problems in the manufacturing and farming sectors, but this is more likely to occur in 2020, since the economy may slow to a halt rather than stop suddenly as firms try to hold out as long as possible. Therefore I do not see a technical recession for 2019 but the risk for 2020 is greater, particularly since the trade war shows no genuine signs of abating and the US government lacks the competency to formulate an effective fiscal response. In addition, despite the Fed having some remaining ammunition, a primary driver of the recent slump in business confidence is uncertainty over trade policy. In these circumstances, monetary policy may not be as effective because even with lower interest rates, firms may not want to invest if they think they are going to lose access to their markets over night. However, I have put a 2% probability because 'never say never'. There may be more unseen shocks in the pipeline which could exacerbate the current circumstances."

The GDP trend is downward but as of now still mostly pointing to positive current conditions. However, we're just seeing data from mid Q2 at this point. 3.2% GDP growth in Q1; ~1-1.5% in Q2. <0% in Q3 is not out of the question. Bottom line: the trend is close enough that I need to consider whether some external factor (like tariffs on Mexican goods, major natural disaster big enough to move GDP, some new geopolitical instability, etc) push the trend lower sharply in time to cause Q2 to be negative. So let's think about that: It would need to be before the 1st half of September (for a really huge event): 1) 5%: I think the tariffs are the biggest threat that could cause Q3 to be negative: => i think this is mostly already appearing in the numbers, but we need to factor in the effect of the threat of Mexican tariffs. Even if they don't go into effect, there is the Exports + imports = ~27% of GDP. Let's assume they slowed down aggregate import/export volume by the equivalent of 1 day (longer delays at border, economic costs). ~1.1% impact on GDP. That's enough to push us into recession in Q3 (and what we're observing now). SO the question is whether the administration will continue on this course in the face of evidence that it is putting the economy at risk. I don't think they would do this intentionally, but I could see miscalculations leading to this outcome especially associated with some unexpected external trigger. =>30% 2) 1%: A related factor is slowing immigration into the US. probably not sudden or significant enough to move the trend much between now and Q3. Offset by increasing government deficit spending. 3) 2%: major natural disaster. Hurricane season is expected to be near average. Big Earthquakes are on the order of 1% / year. Major forest fire: hard to envision that hitting GDP because they don't occur in big cities. Floods: same thing. 4) 1% Major external issue, like bombing or other factor."

However, the odds that 2019 will become a recession year are clearly higher as the recovery is already mature (the upswing started in Q3 2009), many indicators are already heading south and the trade war is a burden fore GDP growth, too. However, there is little evidence that a recession will start already in Q1. The odds are higher for a start in Q2, but still not really high and again somewhat higher for Q3. This means, that the odds for two consecutive negative quarters in 2019 decrease: If the recession just starts in Q4, it ois obvious that two negative quarters in 2019 are impossible. But even if it starts in Q2 or Q3: In two out of the nine periods the 4th and 5th recession quarter were the two first with two consequtive quarters of negrtive real GDP growth and only in seven of this cases that happend right from the start or in the second and third quarter of the recession.

Anyway, there go some thoughts: My starting point is 6% based on historical data. GDP growth has been strong in the last quarters, and it is expected to be 2.8% in Q4 (https://www.frbatlanta.org/cqer/research/gdpnow.aspx). However, when comparing to previous recession, this is similar to Q2 2008 (first negative variance in GDP in Q4, 2008). So, it is possible to ""meet the question's target"" with these levels of GDP. 50/50. Private spending is a key factor in GDP growth. I use some indicators: - Unemployment level (at same levels as 2006/2007, it started to grow a year earlier than Q4, 2008, so adding to ""No"" (https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/unemployment-rate) - Consumer sentiment, still very high compared to 2007 when started to decline, another one for ""No"" (https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-confidence) - Household debt to GDP, also very low (76%) compared to previous years, ""No"" (https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/households-debt-to-gdp) - Business optimism index, stable for the last couple of years, ""No"" (https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/nfib-business-optimism-index) Government deficit in absolute and % of GDP terms, and Fed debt, both extremely high as result of tax cuts. This could be damaging GDP if the Federal Reserve continues with the monetary policy of rate increase, but this is not likely with inflation under control and if the US economy enters into a slowdown (https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/12/15/the-fed-needs-a-new-strategy-for-2019). It would be harder for the US to recover from a recession, but that is not the question here. With the Fed support, ""Yes"" goes down in 5 points. Productivity has decreased, but that is a long term effect, probably longer than the one-year frame for the question. Indicator: short-term vs 10-year bond yield spread is close to zero (apparently, negative difference indicates a recession). One for ""Yes"" +10 points Trigger event: I'm looking for an issue that could turn all indicators into negative, mainly through consumer confidence. I can think about a few: - Trade war with China, increased with challenges in China's growth. The only one I see that could have a short term impact. +4 points - Sillicon Valley vs EU war. - Trump's political difficulties. - KSA - Oil relationships. Finally, it seems to be an increase in mentions to ""Recession"" in media, which can change sentiment, but at medium term only +2 points Total 17%. We need to focus on the rest of indicators."
