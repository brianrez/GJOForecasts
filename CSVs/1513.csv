He believes homosexuality should be illegal, Muslims should be barred from serving in Congress and the constitution exists to foster Christianity. Several women have accused him of offences, which he denies, ranging from sexual harassment to assault; most were teenagers at the time of the alleged incidents. Doug Jones, the Democrat, is a genial former federal prosecutor whose scrappy campaign caught fire. Mr Moore retains strong support among white evangelicals, around half of Alabama’s electorate.

To think these accusations, by themselves, would be considered disqualifying by religious people in Alabama is to completely misunderstand Christian theology as it is preached among evangelicals and fundamentalists.
