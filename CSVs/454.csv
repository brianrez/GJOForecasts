I stated that there is an 80% chance that the gross income for the movie No Time to Die will exceed Skyfall, then a 20% chance that it will be as much or less, then a 5% chance that the movie will gross less than Spectre. Skyfall made $88,364,714 in the first weekend of the showing. The reason that I believed that No Time to Die would exceed this is based on the UK’s first weekend showing gross income. The UK made about 28,891,250 in the first three days of releasing the movie No Time to Die. The reason that this is so big is because of the fact that the UK’s market size is extremely smaller than the USA. This is huge because of the fact that it leaves more of a prediction that the box office income will be extremely high coming into the first weekend of this movie. Another reason that I chose that the movie would exceed Skyfall is due to the fact that it is Daniel Craig’s last time acting as the character James Bond in the movies. People are most likely going to be more inclined to attend the first weekend's showings of the movie due to the fact that is the last time to see him premier in a James Bond movie. Due to these different facts, I believe that at the end of the first weekend, No Time to Die will outsell sky fall."

Whereas Spectre’s opening weekend grossed at £19.8 million in the UK and Skyfall’s grossed at £20.2m, No Time To Die dwarfed both with an impressive £25.9m in its opening weekend (https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-58788368). This shows that audiences are more than ready to head back to the theaters, as fear of COVID has greatly diminished in both the US and the UK since the COVID vaccine has become widely available to the public. In addition, some experts are projecting that No Time To Die could even surpass $100m in its opening weekend (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/04/no-time-to-die-eyes-100-million-domestic-box-office-opening.html). This is due to the huge opening weekend that Venom: Let There Be Carnage had, which grossed just over $90m in its opening weekend. This number is even more impressive due to the fact that the original Venom movie grossed just $80m in its opening weekend (https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/venom-2-box-office-no-time-to-day-1235026486/). Venom: Let There Be Carnage beat its predecessor by over $10m despite competition from other openings The Addams Family 2 and The Many Saints of Newark. No Time To Die, in contrast, has much less box office competition. In addition, No Time To Die scored 84% with critics and 87% with audiences on Rotten Tomatoes thus far, compared to Spectre’s 63% with critics and 61% with audiences as well as Skyfall’s 92% with critics and 86% with audiences (https://www.rottentomatoes.com/franchise/james_bond_007). Clearly, audiences and critics view Skyfall and No Time To Die on similar levels- and both films seem to be significantly more well-received than Spectre. Since this is Daniel Craig’s fifth and final film in the Bond franchise and it is the first Bond film in six years, it is clear to see why audiences would be eager to get out of the house and into the theater to see this critically acclaimed spectacle- helping it to surpass the mark of $88m set by Skyfall (https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/movies/daniel-craig-s-era-james-bond-comes-end-no-time-n1280723)."

Noting that the UK is about a fourth of the population of the US and that films typically perform proportionally domestically would lead one to believe that the domestic box office gross will be around or exceeding $100 million. Along with this, No Time to Die is Daniel Craig's last film, concluding a 5 film series. This suggests that there may be increased draw to theatres for Bond franchise fans, also being the first Bond movie in 6 years. No Time to Die as received high critic reviews, totaling 83% on Rotten Tomatoes which compares to 92% and 63% for Skyfall and Spectre respectively. It is also important to note that the audience score, 87%, is higher than the scores for both of the other films. With the supposed increased threat of covid variants, some may claim that covid may dampen turnout to theatres, however other films have done well in theatres recently despite the state of covid restrictions. For example, Venom: Let There Be Carnage made over 90 million in its domestic opening weekend, suggesting that covid hasnt had much grasp on the market recently. It is possible that No Time to Die performs worse than anticipated in the domestic market as UK indicators may not be wholly accurate; however, I believe it is fair to assume that the newest Bond film will gross higher than both Spectre and Skyfall in its domestic opening weekend."

A quiet place in 2018 took in $50M where as the sequel A quiet place part II has just taken in $48.4M. October is still 4 months away and numbers could still go back up. or are we all just enjoying Netflixs too much??? my initial thoughts are: it looks like things are coming back to normal, and it is the last Daniel Craig so good potential for it to do well. Skyfall was released in 2012 which is quite a long time ago now and it looks like there has been a general trend upward in box office takings. I guess watch the releases of things like black widow and see how that compares to other marvel films to gauge whether people are coming back to the movies. note to self, set a reminder :)"

With this logic, perhaps Skyfall was the ceiling, and No Time to Die will fall short but perhaps above average. However, this is reportedly Craig's last Bond film, with many stars in the cast and much hype during and after production. This will push ticket sales up.
