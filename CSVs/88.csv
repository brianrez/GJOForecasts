That's a bin 3 resolution. However, if I compute my own average based on the individual polls without relying on the auto-generated line, ignoring the high-bias outliers, I project closer to 30 to 31, and that is if things linearly get worse. So all in all it's predominantly a bin 3 resolution in terms of plurality in probabilities. But to me it's still only slightly the most probable (52%)."

However, I don't think he will be able to secure more than 36 seats, and it is entirely possible that Naftali Bennett is able to sway the Israeli populous towards his right-wing party. Nevertheless, we have seen Netanyahu make more than one come-back and it is very likely that the Likud will win relatively big in the next election."

In 2021 polling was ~30% and they ended up with 30 seats, this time round ~35% so there's is a chance they might get slightly more seats but there's still some time left until the election and the electoral system might not confer an exact increase from polls to seats, so I've hedged between the middle two options. Last time anyone got more than 36 seats was in 2003 with Likud under Sharon, so it seems unlikely but can't rule out a rush to the most popular party just to end the gridlock of the past few years so given it a small probability."
