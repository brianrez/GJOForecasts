The official told Axios that Priebus is ""with the program"" of a more cooperative and inclusive approach for the White House. But the report said chief White House strategist Stephen Bannon is increasingly isolated and will be forced out if he is unable to adopt a cooperative approach. Several outlets have reported that Bannon is frequently clashing with Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as the president's daughter Ivanka Trump. Both Ivanka Trump and Kushner reportedly want a more moderate and results-oriented approach for the White House, while Bannon refuses to find common ground."" Comments: I have to agree with this."
