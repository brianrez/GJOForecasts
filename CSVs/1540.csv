1775,2017-11-01T21:07:39Z,1,[40.0],[40.0],"Appreciate NickHare’s establishment of a historical baseline, which I think comes from this story . That link isn’t working for me at the moment, but I can see the following information from the page: “More than 330 WWII monuments to Red Army vanished in Poland in last 20 years, envoy says...Twenty years ago, more than 560 World War II monuments to the Red Army were located on Poland's territory outside burial...” Assuming that number is accurate, that’s 1.37 monuments removed per month. I can’t find good background information regarding the timing of those removals, but I think it’s as safe to assume that they came down in batches as it is to assume that they came down at a steady rate. Still, in lieu of better information, this is the best baseline we seem to have. In terms of more recent (and documented) cases: At least one “Soviet monument was removed from the town of Pieniezno” in 2015 and a mausoleum in Trzcianka was knocked down in September 2017 , despite the protests of the Russian MFA. In the case of Pieniezno, Russia threatened Poland with “most serious consequences.” The city went ahead with the removal anyway. So we know that removals have happened recently and that they’ve happened over the strenuous objection of the Russians. Cities and provinces weren’t waiting for federal legislation to pull down monuments. But was that the low-hanging fruit, perhaps? Are many of the remaining monuments in more pro-Russia areas? It doesn’t seem that we have the data to really make that determination, unfortunately. There are around 500 standing and about half that number have been targeted for removal by this order . Per the RFE story footnoted below, “A 2007 poll…showed around 57 percent of respondents were against the removal of Soviet monuments. But Polish attitudes toward Moscow have hardened significantly since Russia's 2014 annexation of…the Crimean Peninsula.” This information is only slightly useful. Ideally, we’d have more recent results, with some sense of the geographic distribution of anti-Soviet monument sentiment. The articles footnoted below say “it is up to city councils whether they want them (the monuments) cleared, but an official in Warsaw’s city council said that while they had no plans to remove their (in Warsaw) Soviet monuments, the provincial authorities, which are more closely aligned to Poland’s governing party, can overrule their decision.” Multiple layers of red tape make it tougher to know what to make of strong sentiments from any one policymaker. It’s worth noting that at least one demolition took eight months from decision to removal, so while it’s not clear that we’d have any warning that a municipality had made a decision to remove, it seems to me that the Russians would be crowing about it well in advance. Perhaps this long lead time is a one off, I can’t be sure without a better archive. In summary: There are a lot of question marks here. I can only find recent news coverage of about one removal per year, but that’s well off the historic average. I think it’s safe to assume for these purposes that the law was passed with the intention of spurring more removals, though it could have been a primarily symbolic gesture. Given the lack of clarity around the issue, I’m starting in the 40-60 range and adjusting down incrementally until the end of the prediction period. Given there are no current (English-language) stories about impending removals, and that previous removals have taken quite some time to come to completion, I’ll start at 40% and adjust downward. There are 57 days to resolution, so I’ll take a percentage point off every day between now and then and keep an eye on the headlines, adjusting upwards if there are rumblings of a specific removal."

History (mostly negative) and current political/military situation say so and it just takes one, sanctioned or not..... Observer, October 20, 'Poland Pushes Back Against Putin’s Special War': http://observer.com/2017/10/poland-pushes-back-against-putins-special-war/ Clips from Observer article: ""It’s no accident that NATO’s new Centre of Excellence for counterintelligence just opened shop in Poland. The Atlantic Alliance runs several Centres of Excellence, specializing in a wide array of military and security subjects, and the creation of a CoE for counterintelligence could not be better timed. The new Cracow-based CoE will provide counterintelligence expertise and training to NATO students, with an emphasis on rising espionage threats. Antoni Macierewicz, Poland’s defense minister, explained forthrightly that the Cracow center is “fundamentally important, especially in the face of threats from Russia.”"
