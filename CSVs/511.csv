However, this bill would still reach the following obstacles: - Lack of progressive support. Most Blue states, and progressive districts, already have minimum wages above that proposed by Republicans. Additionally, Chuck Schumer is the Majority Leader and he has been working very hard to keep progressives on-board so I doubt he is going to look for a middling minimum wage compromise. For perspective, the Romney-Cotton bill was not well received by the left and any add ons to a minimum wage will further kill momentum. - A difficult bi-partisan environment.

I would say the chance of Congress raising the minimum wage by some amount is still close to 0 given (1) the greater focus on voting rights and the infrastructure bill and (2) likely resistance from many Democrats to raising it to less than $15.
