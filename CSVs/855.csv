The revised methodology ensures data is fully deduplicated and that only tests that passed through the data submission quality checks are counted in Total Tests. Test submissions that error out of the system due to data quality issues will not be counted until they are successfully resubmitted and pass validation requirements.

However, MS will be really interesting (could stay lower), MP had their fifth case before mid-September so they're hanging on the cliff to nine or ten!

Thus we have at least 34 states that we deem as ""safe"" estimates (i.e. Sept. case counts will likely be higher than June). It is very unlikely that we will see less than 27 states and more than 44 states based on the number of edge cases (e.g. the number of states whose September numbers are less than June numbers by a max of 500 is zero).

In the last 14 days, there has been a rise in cases in 9 states, a decrease in 17, and stagnation in 24. However, when considering the inefficiencies in testing, resulting in under testing and backlogs, the gradual reopening of states, despite a lack of decrease in case numbers, and the commencement of in person instruction that will begin at the end of August and beginning of September, I predict that cases will rise again in states where they are stagnant and/ or decreasing."

While it seems to be that 5 states (California, Florida, Texas, New York, and Georgia) account for approximately 40% of all coronavirus vases in the United States to date, New York seems to be much better than it was back in March/April. Per NYT coronavirus data, about 10 states in the western US (Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas) are experiencing very few cases - and have not changed significantly since the onset of the virus in the US, thus making the 44< and 36-44 cases relatively unlikely. However, the resurgence of the virus in the southern states (specifically southeastern states) and a predicted upcoming outbreak in the midwest makes me believe that there is a high likelihood for at least half of the states to have more cases in September than in June (with a relatively small probability that fewer than 11 states have more cases in September)"

However, I think a re-evaluation is in order given how brutal July was for COVID resurgence - it really makes June look like it wasn't that bad in hindsight, and so I had to heavily modify my answer. Macro factors in favor of more cases - crisis fatigue, outright rebellion for second lockdown. Better testing capabilities. Schools opening up across the country (Specifically in NYC, could be a disaster). Unequal circumstances make it so that NY could return to normal while other states are still clamped down – this would breed resentment, anger, and make people not care enough to enforce protocol – diversity of outcomes in this country makes difficult to have coherent national message. Factors against: June had protests, lockdown protests, prime summer months. September is cold enough in some states to deter activitiy. Testing apparatus could remain stunted, intentionally dampened.

Thus in order for september to be lower, it would require a decrease in cases from now till september. A couple of factors make this less likely - this many months of isolation have led to lockdowns being completely scorned and ineffective. Reduction would require changes in infection rates and transmission rates. I don't see transmission rates reducing because of the widespread community spread. I think infection rates can be reduced with wider mask acceptance (which we see on both sides of the aisle), but I don't envision this reduction being negative enough to offset the violent July increase.

I'm mainly considering two things where I'm making this forecast: the timeline for new cases to drop (we have been in the increasing cases stage in most states) and the general attitude of states' constituents towards wearing masks and following government guidelines. Most states we see cases pick up in June, and given we estimate it will be about 2-3 months before new cases per day decline. We should see new cases per day start to decline by August/September. Would have said September only, but given some states are not as dense as New York's corona hotpots, will allow for slightly less time. This leaves my fair at roughly half the states since September and June are both relatively the same distance from our estimated peak (1.5 months in). To account for the fact that most states that are witnessing surges in cases have constituents that refuse to wear masks/strongly do not want to follow government precautions, we can see how it could possible take longer than the 3 months it took NY to see daily new cases fall.

That being said, Trump recently began wearing face masks consistently, causing a rise in approval rating for wearing masks and likely leading to greater adoption, while news on vaccines remains steady with a release still expected late this year. The greatest risk still remains either an extremely early vaccine/therapy or a horrendous outbreak across the country.

For the remaining ~35 states and the 5 territories listed above, we can probably say 50% of them experience some kind of school restart, and with how packed schools are inevitably and kids (even college students) probably not being able to pull of the best practices for social distancing and care, they will also experience some kind of restart.

However June was the beginning of the current set of infections and if infection rates are to settle to a level it may not be any lower than the rates seen in many states in June.

Based on the NYTimes state-level maps, 43 states are currently seeing daily new cases on the rise. For almost all of these states, daily new cases are above levels seen in June because the end of May was the trough of the 'first wave' before reopening in most of those states. Next, we should check what the lifecycle of a case resurgence looks like. Based on the initial wave of cases in the states with the most serious outbreaks (NY, CT, NJ, DC etc.) a cycle takes above 2-3 months to run its course with a reasonable amount of variance. Thus, we can expect states that started to resurge in mid-June as reopening commenced to be at the tail end of their cycles. This would cause us to move our estimate downwards from the baseline of low-40's. But two important context specific factors bake me keep my distribution centered fairly high in the upper 30's. First, though some states like California have been willing to reinstitute lockdown policies due to the second wave, most other state governors have not been willing to do so. Still, even if lockdown-esque policies are put in place, rates of testing are much higher so even if test-positivity rates are lower, the raw number of cases will be higher than before simply because we are catching more cases. The policy variable does add the most uncertainty to my estimate though which is why I put decent probability on all outcomes from 12-35 states below my max of 36-43. State governors are increasingly encouraging the use of masks and mask usage in the US is on the rise. It is possible that as masks become more widespread, we reach a point at which we see substantial reductions in new cases without states having to go into full lockdowns. This variable is uncertain both from a policy perspective, a cultural perspective, and a public health efficacy perspective."

Around the end of June 2020 we observed a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases and it continuously break daily new cases record. Yesterday, July 11th, we have seen over 70k new COVID cases across United States. It is still unknown to us how the second wave will play out and how long the new cases increase will last. However, even if the upward trend for new cases is quickly controlled, it doesn’t mean new cases will disappear overnight. Based on the first wave reaction in United States, we observe that the new cases capped around April 1st and hovered at essentially the same level for about 2 months and a half. Right now, state governments are essentially doing similar things to manage the spread of second wave COVID, as they do to manage the first wave. Therefore, it is highly probable that we will observe the new cases curve plateaued (higher daily number than June 2020) rather than sharply dropped to zero and I assign such probability 70%. In this case, if we assume all states are independent, then the base mean for the number of states to have higher number of cases in September than June is 38.5.

A couple pieces of information inform this prediction. First, the recent wave in several US states has persisted without as much aggressive state action compared to what I expected - thus I believe more states will weigh opening their economies over reducing cases. Secondly, the death rate in several of these states HAS NOT spiked in conjunction with cases due in part to the age distribution of cases shifting to younger people. This trend along with improving healthcare means the cost of new cases in terms of human lives is lower than before so states will tolerate more new cases in September than they did in June."

National and state-wide lockdown policies are increasingly less likely to occur due to the fact that there are going to be >20 legislative battleground chambers and the presidential election. Instituting lockdown policies in a timely matter before Septemberwould be a divisive course of action that would likely hurt these politicians chances of re-election as many regions of the US have seemingly decided that the costs of lockdown on their mental, financial, and emotional health outweigh the threat of covid.

Thus, a fair number of these states may have more cases in September than now. Furthermore, cooling temperatures alongside the reopening of schools will not help. The fat tail reflects the chance that we see this phenomenon become widespread as even states that were successful in suppressing the first wave experience a letup.

Without dependence, the extreme cases will be extremely unlikely which is unreasonable given that there is a lot of variability in the possible scenarios that can occur in the next 2 months (although they still should be considered improbable). Also, the eventual increase in the test numbers should increase the number of positives which would otherwise be undetected because of the lack of symptoms. Many states with a low or moderate number of test cases might focus more on opening the economy which will result in the increase of cases (even if it will be tiny, it will still count towards the forecasted value) - this suggests that the mean of the distribution should be rather high (around 20).

In addition to that, tests are more easy to access and probably will continue to be so, but funding will decrease. so we can assume these cancel out.

This is to say, that simply reducing restrictions within countries has led to, albeit smaller, second waves. The question of a second or third wave, is not a question of “if,” but one of “when.” The answer? The regular cold and flu season, which, year after year, is in the fall and winter months, when our immune systems are more susceptible to influenzae and coronaviruses. This virus will be no different, and a vaccine is still a long way out, regardless of what our governments and media portray. A vaccine developed, and tested, and successful, completed within one year, would be unprecedented, as it has never been done. Ever. Therefore, the vast majority of states, and countries worldwide, are highly likely to see cases explode in the next cold and flu season, unless further restrictions for social distancing are put in place long beforehand."

The question is how local governments and individuals will respond to these increases. I believe “pandemic fatigue” will be a significant factor in the decisions for both, particularly as we become more accustomed to (and comfortable with) routine reports of deaths in the thousands. The course of the pandemic so far suggests that undetected (untested and never reported) community spread can require a significant time period (months) before resulting in the kind of widespread transmission that can’t be overlooked. Testing and and contract tracing are the key tools to avoid this trap, but there isn’t nearly enough of it occurring, and that seems likely to persist, given the lack of support and coordination being offered by our federal government. More cases in September than June is a pretty low bar to clear, so I am fairly confident that it will be the case in most places. The bigger unknown is how testing will unfold. It’s unfortunate, but in some states, political beliefs could have a significant impact on whether sufferers choose to be tested and counted, as is already the case with the use of face masks. Testing in general may fall out of favor in some states, with availability poor and political incentives to keep it that way. The other uncertainty for me involves timing. Numbers may or may not dip in the summer, with people often outdoors. And random chance will also play its part, given the proportion of COVID-19 transmission that can be attributed to individual superspreader events. September may be too specific a time frame for the overall trends I expect to see."

Another consideration is that even low density, rural states could have higher cases, because it doesn't take much to move small numbers higher.

Following too many questions to do that super work so just read your comments instead. As things open in June cases will go up so baseline will be higher. In September, however, kids go back to school and unknowingly spread things. Next: what about all those college campuses? If summer goes ok will we let down our guard?
