The NUG has announced a ‘peoples defensive war against the junta and so abandoning the non-violent tactics of Suu Kyi as adopted during her house arrest.

He was appointed permanent representative to the UN in 2018 but has been with the Permanent Mission of Myanmar to the UN since 2012. This means he has momentum and reputation. He is currently serving in the New York office of the UN.

If they are kept in limbo then Russia and China stay happy and appeased. If the UN recognizes the NUG then it also acknowledges a new conflict. (Afghan, Syria, Sudan, Palestine). Russia and China are hoping EU and US are just tired of managing small conflicts - playing wack o mole with democracy, during COVID.

Great article here: https://www.justsecurity.org/76641/beyond-the-coup-can-the-united-nations-escape-its-history-in-myanmar/ (nice link @keith-huggins ) In the past with member delegates 'possesion is 9/10ths of the law...', NUG holds current position and they are trying to maintain it. But in the long run the UN goes with the 'government on the ground' which would be the Junta. It is rare that the UN goes with their conscience except in the case of apartheid South Africa. Recent situations where there have been delegates from both groups have led to no delegates being admitted for Myanmar but the Sep meeting should force a decision."
