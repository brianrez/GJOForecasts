The presidential decree was published in the National Journal and became instant law. But since the state of the brand of the current regime does not inspire or attract foreign capital, the government revoked the presidential decree less than 16 hours later, not done by the Captain himself, but in a special edition of the National Journal, as if his communications team thought that that would shield the president (who is not a member of a political party) from any political blowback. Inflation is now around 3 percent (some say 2.2 percent) with food prices (including shortages of rice and soy) shooting up. This all sugests that Guedes may exit state right, particularly if Biden wins the US presidency.

The disagreement between Bolosonaro and Guedes on economy is more subtle. - If Mr Bolsonaro fires Mr Guedes, it will impact massively the stock market as international investors trust Mr Guedes - Mr Guedes is an educated economic liberal with no future political ambition.

So here for me the question is more on the date: December 1st. I do think the probability that Paulo Guedes resigns is high, estimated at 0.8. Now, the question is to estimate the probability that he will resign / be fired before Dec 1st. - he resigned before Dec 1st Comparison with the 2 other cases: : Moro was the star of the Brazilian government because of the Car Wash investigation. He enjoys the support of the majority of Brazilians, more than Bolsonaro, whose popularity is in decline. Contrarily to Moro, Mr Guedes is an educated economic liberal with no future political ambition. He does not need to disaffiliate himself from Bolsonaro's balance sheet in order to protect his future. Regarding the health ministry, again the comparison does not make that much sense as Brazil was one of the countries was one of the countries worst affected by covid-19. It has had 4m confirmed cases largely on the president’s fault. Given this disastrous health results, it is unsurprising to see such unstability at health ministy. On the other hand, Salim Mattar, Brazil’s privatization secretary, and Paulo Uebel, the debureaucratisation secretary, walked out on August 11 after complaining about the lack of progress in the government’s economic agenda. At the time of the news Mr Guedes understood the sign of dissatisfaction as the trademark reforms had stumbled during the coronavirus crisis, but placing the blame on the “political establishment”. but it was already almost a month ago ans he is still here -> proba 15% [1] - he is fired by Bolsonaro: low probable 2% as it will impact massively the stock market as international investors trust Mr Guedes, no real rationale for this [1] https://www.ft.com/content/c63d45a1-8e79-42df-84a8-00f7b089ca88"

Yes, Guedes could simply resign and that appears the most likely reason he would leave given his division with the PM but there could be other factors for his departure as well (e.g. Bolsanaro just replaces him). Since Minister of the Economy Pedro Malan (I use him as a starting point since Minister of Economies before him served very short terms and would seem not to generate a reasonable base rate), only 1/6 Ministers of the Economy have resigned. Thus, we put the probability that Guedes leaves his position at slightly higher to adjust for other reasons for his ""departure"" -> 22%. Now determining his departure before 1 December 2020 is harder. At best I put this at 33% based on the news sentiment. Thus the probability that he leaves his position before 1 December 2020 becomes 7.26%."

At most, it seemed like maybe a 1/3 chance of him resigning at the time. As mentioned in the articles, there is ongoing tension about the administration's economic policies. The president has extended significant social benefit programs in response to the coronavirus, but Guedes is a staunch UChicago school economist. He opposes any renewal of Brazil's previous proclivity for excessive spending. - He recently lost another battle to Bolsonaro on a matter relatively unrelated to the government's coronavirus response. At Guedes' request, the government freezed hiring for new positions (previously existing positions could still be filled). This was just lifted so Brazil's FBI and FDA could hire more investigators, among other new employees. This seems like the administration is kind of spitting in the fact of Guedes', as this policy change delivers him another defeat on a relatively unimportant issue. - Guedes' is the subject of an investigation into his dealings with pension funds. However, the investigation was opened in 2018 and there have been few, if any, developments since then. Also, Brazil's justice system moves relatively slowly. He would only be forced to leave if massive revelations came to light and the public demanded his ouster. Bolsonaro is also no friend of the justice system, and he is more likely than not to oppose any attempts by the justice department to intervene in his administration. - previous ministers of the economy have stayed in office for about 1 year on average. Guedes' is on the longer end of the typical range. That being said, it seems like ministers who are the first to fill their position in that administration stay longer than replacements."

Too much unemployment and a population undergoing perrengue will make him arrive in 2022 well dehydrated. Bolsonaro's issue is the spending limit. I don't know if Paulo Guedes will stay until the end of the year”. Bolsanaro does not want the fiscal restraints and the 2021 budget is to be sent to their Congress soon.

The extended social benefits paid by federal government during Guedes' watch, to poor individuals and families who are hard hit by COVID-19 pandemia aren't much. But they are helping stabilize- and in some cases- increase the Captain's popularity in the impoverished Northeastern states which pretty much went against him full tilt in the 2016 elections. The political consequences of these benefits, (these benefits are quite small considering the the amounts of money the political class misappropriate) however, will lead to consequeces down the road, after December because of the way the federal government pays, and collects and ""defers"" taxes for plutocratic interests. Guedes has been quoted in Brazil media as being always ready to resign if he feels it is necessary, may have to wait until economic data after all the ignominous ""black fridays"" and a possible pickup of the economy after Christmas sales are measured, which is after the closing date of this problem."

From a Brazilian Article: “As economic activity collapses amid the pandemic of the covid-19, and lawsuits in the Judiciary are advancing on the surroundings of the Plateau, President Jair Bolsonaro increased the charges to the Minister of Economy, Paulo Guedes. In search of a lifeline for good news, the president wants more tangible results in the economic area. Unable to deliver what he promised since the pension reform was approved, Guedes is running out of arguments to maintain the optimistic speech of a robust resumption of the economy after the crisis. The forecast for the fall of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for this year is constantly being revised downwards. “Certainly, Guedes will be charged for results and to provide more incentives, especially for spending on infrastructure. The Centrão will demand more presence in the government in exchange for supporting Bolsonaro's political survival. I cannot see in the same equation Guedes, Centrão and Planalto military. Someone is left over and, in this case, it is the Minister of Economy ”, evaluated Sergio Vale, chief economist at MB Associados.“ Going to up chances he will be out."

Members of the Republicans say the government has offered the party to head the Special Secretariat for Productivity, Employment and Competitiveness, now headed by Carlos da Costa. * The information is from Crusoé magazine"

""ask Guedes"" is the generic reply from the presidency, that one finds in online media and on social media. One could view that as ""throwing someone under the bus."" An image of Guedes wearing a mask at a photo-op where the president and some others serving in his cabinet were not wearing mask went viral. This could be interpreted by some among the presidency as Guedes, wittingly showing disrespect for the ""chain of command."" Then too, the president and those close to him wear masks on occasion to palliate critics. It all might turn on what happens during the US presidential election campaign, who wins, and whether Brazil will need to start printing money and fund up social programs, which are an anethema to the ""Chicago school"" (and closet Hayekistas) that Guedes was chosen by the president's ""transition team"" to represent.
