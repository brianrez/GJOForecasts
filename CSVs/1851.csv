From here http://cdn.bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/2012%20Voter%20Turnout%20Full%20Report.pdf you can see 153 million registered in 2012, so maybe 160 million registered voters in 2016 as a base number."

Estimate the % of population that is of voting age by regression over elections since 2000. This has been creeping up in a fairly linear fashion, so estimating 77.35% of the population will be of voting age. Of these people, the number eligible to vote is about 92.3%, which has been pretty steady, so this is just an average since 2000. Of eligible voters, we're seeing 55% to 61% turnout. Average of the past 4 presidential elections gives about 58%. Multiply it all together and you have about 135.3 million, so just slightly over the top threshold. I guess you can factor in whether you think this will be higher than average or lower than average, but that's a toss up for me. Sorry the table is hard to read, they don't do a good job with formatting on this site."

A charismatic young senator with a media-magnet wife, appealing children and a hopeful, optimistic and progressive vision burst upon the scene in both 1960 and 2008, energizing first-time voters. 1968 and 2004 were war referendums, the first driven by the Baby Boomers growing rejection of Vietnam policy, the second by their objection to the war in Iraq (an echo-Boom, of sorts), which pulled the now-overlooked Gen X into the fray. In 1964, civil rights took center stage, and motivated young people both to protest and to vote. That energy is present again, but has no Lyndon Johnson around which to focus. Sec. Clinton and Mr. Trump may collectively appall the reliable (e.g. older) portion of the electorate into the booth, but neither will entice voters young enough to correctly conclude that the system is ""rigged"" against them."
