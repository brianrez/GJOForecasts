King Mohammed VI, who is the highest authority in Morocco in both State and religious aspects, congratulated the new Prime Minister of Israel, Naftali Bennett on his election. Morocco’s main policy goal is to gain international recognition for its sovereignty over Western Sahara that was gained from Trump’s government as a prerequisite for normalising relations with Israel. The Israeli carrier Israir is commencing flights between Tel Aviv and Marrakesh in July 2021. Therefore, contrary to my previous argument, I will suggest (and concede) that Morocco is the sixth country to recognise Israel albeit sans consular facilities and given the overriding authority of the King."

The sixth state expected to add to these was Oman. However, Oman prefers to remain a relationship with Iran that a recognition of Israel would harm. The recent conflict in Gaza and the condemnation from the Arab League of Israel concerning the plight of the Palestinians has halted any further recognition in the immediate future. Saudi foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan stated that ‘the kingdom “categorically rejects the Israeli violations against Palestinians”, while calling for an immediate ceasefire’. The remote chance of Saudi Arabia recognising Israel as a bulwark to Iran is now more remote. A recent meeting of Muslim Nations concerning the Gaza conflict, criticized not only Israel but those Arab League countries who now recognised it."

There are reports of a recent meeting between Israel and SA (https://www.businessinsider.com/us-arranged-israel-saudi-meeting-as-reward-for-assassination-sources-2020-11), but that meeting was publicly denied by SA and no formal recognition resulted for now. Pundits believe that SA recognition is not possible under King Salman, but may be under his successor, MBS. The Trump administration made Arab recognition of Israel a key part of its foreign policy, but his failed reelection bid leaves the future of the recent momentum up in the air. I suspect many Arab states will wait to see how a new Biden administration approaches the subject.

It's also possible that within the long time frame other countries come around to normalizing ties with Israel without a Palestine deal.

Pragmatism has become a common thread that join certain Arab League Nations in their concern (fear) over the intentions and actions of Iran together with friendly relations with the U.S. together with Israel’s technological edge in fields when compared with the Arab League. Therefore, the number of member states most likely to recognise Israel by 28 August 2021 would be probably 4."
