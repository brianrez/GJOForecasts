Now that most of Hong Kong's competitors, like Singapore, no longer have quarantine requirements for vaccinated travellers, it is difficult for Hong Kong to attract conferences and events. That explains why CEO John Lee announced that Hong Kong is planning to change the requirements."

107215,2022-09-20T09:01:15Z,2,[73.0],[20.0],An increasing number of sources I am finding online suggest an end to hotel quarantine by the end of this month (possibly even an announcement this week) and a move to a system of 7 days self-supervision. I do imagine that as we head into winter this could be undone but I am pretty sure they will at least trial it.

It's complex for me. I could see that my updates are large and chunky, therefore I would tend to lower my forecast toward uncertainty. Sometimes I see a forecaster such as yourself with decent info but not updating higher to my forecast, then I adjust back down. Sometimes I read something or see something on the news. I adjust. Maybe on a second look on the same day, I come up with another estimate. Sometimes I take the average or adjust accordingly to whichever estimate I judge more appropriate."

107215,2022-09-17T18:07:43Z,1,[53.0],[53.0],"Hotel quarantine has recently been reduced to 3 days (admittedly with a further 4 days of self-supervision). Also, as of today the City's health chief Lo Chung-mau has said that the government has ""a positive attitude"" toward shortening hotel quarantine. This pushes it towards being more likely than not. However, given Lo's close ties with Beijing and the unlikelihood of the CCP moving away from their zero-covid policy, any uptick in covid cases from reducing restrictions (and thereby encouraging inbound travel) is likely to push the date further back. With winter coming and the reduced effectiveness of vaccination with time this increases the chances further."
