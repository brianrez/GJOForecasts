They already have cars -and built some of their own- on the road running autonomously, but the point is not to built the car is to build the technology and collect patents for sale! In the know-how is where the big bucks are for google, not metal boxes. Once the present technology is reduced to operate and look in a manner that make the car looks (no what people think is normal looking vehicle, not a mini humpback whale) like any other car, then we will see another set of vehicles to test google software and hardware capabilities. The present awkwardness of the technology is something they know people are still looking at what they are doing as science fiction, thus those google built mini boxes, they realized that problem of perception.

It also looks like google within the last 3 days placed 40 positions (for hire) for the AV project. Considering Google is a publicly traded company it would make sense to get more bang for the buck. That means I suspect an ""announcement"" would come just before or during quarterly earnings. The next earnings for Google is within the next couple weeks (27 Sept 2016 estimated). Also considering Google (GOOG) stock price near all time highs, uncertainty of the FED and GOOG monthly chart indicating distribution I suspect an announcement could come in the next couple weeks. A breakout of google above all time highs could pay for the entire AV public testing. Starting out at 70%."
