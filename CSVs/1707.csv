"Between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018, will an armed group from the Philippines engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in the Philippines?",2017-03-31T17:00:53Z,2017-07-01T06:59:53Z,Yes,"['Yes', 'No']",['Security and Conflict'],360,654,120,237,"The EWP is asking forecasters to help provide early risk assessments to policy makers, NGOs, and other international actors about the systematic killing of civilians resulting in mass fatalities (Early Warning Project). This question is part of a series of quarterly questions (Good Judgment Inc). It will be suspended on 30 June 2017 and will be resolved in April 2018 after EWP assesses the situation in the Phillipines from April 2017 to March 2018. Armed groups include but are not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias. Campaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation). In general, unrelated executions of individuals or the accidental killing of civilians in war will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians. If an armed group is engaged in multiple campaigns that systematically kill civilians (e.g., in different geographic areas, or targeted against separate civilian groups) those fatalities will be counted separately and the question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilians fatalities occur in one or more campaigns. See (Early Warning Project) for examples. See (GJ Open) for GJâ€™s FAQ on forecasting questions like this. Confused?

How this is resolved will depend on whether the scorers believe the authorities and on what gets counted as a single campaign, and maybe on what counts as a geographic area. Is the ostensible war on drugs in which civilians have been and will be killed by police a different campaign on Luzon than on Mindanao, for example; or because it has been moderated a bit, will it count as a different one when Duterte ratchets it up again? Similarly, Duterte's folks will be gunning down civilians they claim are in cahoots with the terrorists. Not sure whether they can rack up a big enough score, but is this a campaign directed at civilians?"

Strong Catholic faith in the Philippines is another plus in the prevention of genocide because the Catholics are likely to meet violence with violence against Islamic terrorists. They have a world wide star in Manny Pacquiao who could bring further attention to the nation if violence escalates. The Philippines is too important to the US and the world to leave pockets of the country vulnerable to mass killings. I imagine the US and other western nations have eyes and ears on the ground throughout every region. The Philippines has been accessible to the west for a very long time. I predict no armed group from the Philippines will engage in a campaign that kills 1,000 or more civilians in the Philippines."

While civilians also fall victim to such attacks (IEDs, UXO, etc.), there is usually no systematic approach to it. Inter-clan or inter-religious violence is usually on a small scale. State security forces are unlikely to specifically target civilians, in part due to a fragile yet promising peace process with the major Muslim rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). In areas where communist rebels are present, the civilian population is rarely a deliberate target. One reason might be that both the state security forces and civilians in such areas are predominately Christian and share language and culture - at least to a larger degree than in Muslim areas. DISCLAIMER: The way the question is asked leaves it open if the ""War on Drugs"" should be included in the answer or not. When considering the probability of systematic mass killing, I did NOT include the deaths of civilians in the ""War on Drugs"". However, I can see why one would, so I suggest to rephrase the question or to split it into two separate questions. If you consider the ""War on Drugs"" to be a campaign that systematically kills civilians in the Philippines, the probability for the killing of 1,000 or more civilians within one year would be closer to 99%."
