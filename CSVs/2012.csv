Congress is not in session again before 2017, so the US is extremely unlikely to pass sanctions in the window suggested by the question. The United States has been the primary target of Russian cyber operations, though this is likely to shift as Russian aggression against the Balkan states grows next year. Until then, however, no other Western nation possesses sufficient motive to press for retaliatory sanctions against the Federation. In short, it's very, very unlikely."

At that point, cyber was not in any specific countries sanctions list, though was a coverall E.O. Sony hack was known and HR757 was in play against NK. My view was that if 757 became law, if it included a prohibited activity referencing cyber this would count as a sanction. Well 757 became law, EO 13722 (https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/nk_eo_20160316.pdf) was published March 15, 2016 and this now specifically prohibited transaction with NK due to it having engaged in significant activities undermining cybersecurity. Fairly summarised here https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr757/summary, ""“It imposes mandatory sanctions on individuals who contribute to North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile program, its malicious cyber-attacks, """". OFAC agrees (https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/nkorea.pdf) that under ""E.O. 13722 blocks the property and interests in property of the Government of North Korea and the Workers’ Party of Korea... for ... engaged in significant activities undermining cybersecurity"", but prohibited activities it turns out are not sanctions (for this q) and so this didnt count (section V of OFAC seemingly takes a different view, which was my view, but did not to resolve this q). It seems to be have been successfully argued this is a framework and not an actual sanction, whereby to trigger a yes an individual or organisation in addition to the Government of NK needed to be blocked and added to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List) to count. Darn. So then I patiently waited the 6 months for Obama to report on as per 757, turns out he didnt want to add anyone to the list, probably thinking NK Govt and Workers Party of Korea was enough. Darn x 2. Then feint hope that the sanctions brought in response to the SWIFT attacks (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/02/world/asia/treasury-imposes-sanctions-on-north-korea.html?_r=0) and (from 38North: Sergei Shevchenko and Adrian Nish, “Cyber heist attribution,” BAE Systems Threat Research Blog, May 13, 2016, http://baesystemsai.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/cyber-heist-attribution.html. See also: “SWIFT attacker’s malware linked to more financial attacks”; Symantec Official Blog, May 26, 2016, https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/swift-attackers-malware-linked-more-financial-attack), but these were deemed sanctions already in prep not in response to, nor the final straw. Darn x 3. Overall, went too heavy too quickly and misunderstood it - going to hurt me along with other cyber miss."

And then?': http://www.wsj.com/articles/obamas-russia-epiphany-1475881969 Clips from WSJ article: ""The meddling in U.S. elections is another matter. In an unusual joint statement Friday, the Department of Homeland Security and Director of National Intelligence said that “the U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.” The U.S. spooks added that “the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia,” and that given the “scope and sensitivity” of these efforts “only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.” Senior-most is a euphemism for Mr. Putin. One question is why the Obama Administration has gone public with this hacking news now. One reason might be to warn Russia against dumping more of the U.S. documents it almost certainly has before Election Day. But then Russia’s hacking habits are hardly new, and Mr. Putin is still harboring the national-security thief Edward Snowden. The timing suggests the White House may also be trying to help Hillary Clinton given her campaign’s portrayal of Donald Trump as a Putin apologist. Sure enough, her campaign issued a statement linking Mr. Trump to the news almost on cue Friday. A public declaration alone won’t stop the Russians. Mr. Putin has little incentive to cease because he and Russia have never paid a price for their cyber thievery. Now that he’s had an epiphany about the Kremlin, will Mr. Obama continue to let Mr. Putin get away with it?"""

It “seems to be a global campaign,” the aide said. As a result, the issue has “moved up as a priority” for the intelligence agencies, which include the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security as well as the CIA and the National Security Agency. Some congressional leaders briefed recently by the intelligence agencies on Russian influence operations in Europe, and how they may serve as a template for activities in the United States, were disturbed by what they heard. After Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) ended a secure 30-minute phone briefing given by a top intelligence official recently, he was “deeply shaken,” according to an aide who was with Reid when he left the secure room at the FBI’s Las Vegas office."""

The training involves 25,000 American troops and 50,000 South Korean soldiers, according to the U.S. and South Korean militaries. South Korea’s President Park Geun-hye said on Monday that there were signs of “serious cracks” in the North’s ruling elite class after defections of key figures she didn’t identity. Ms. Park told a security meeting that Pyongyang could carry out cyber attacks or other provocations on South Korea to divert public attention away from such domestic problems.""

For example, prior to elections, the Ukraine election system was attacked with a virus intended to delete the election results. The Miami-Dade Elections Department in Florida similarly experienced increased malicious activity, but instead was the target of ‘phantom absentee ballot’ requests. The targets do extend beyond organizations associated with the election. The hack on the Philippines Commission on Elections exposed the personally identifiable information of 55 million citizens. In Africa, countries as diverse as Ghana, Ethiopia, and Republic of Congo have started censoring social media during the election season, but in many cases it expanded to also blocking mobile money transfer sites, thus having both an impact on freedom of speech as well as economic well-being."" The conundrum is that making cyber manipulation public can backfire, sanctions is a form of messaging and publicizing that would not work well in these cases"

SentinelOne’s researchers believe the malware was created by a team of hackers working for a government, likely from eastern Europe, according to a report published on Tuesday. Hacking forums, of course, are home to a lot of malicious data and software. But they are usually not places where sophisticated government-made hacking tools get exchanged. Shamir said that the malware, dubbed Furtim, was “clearly not” made by cybercriminals to make some money but for a government spying operations. Furtim is a “dropper tool,” a platform that infects a machine and then serves as a first step to launch further attacks. It was designed to target specifically European energy companies using Windows, was released in May, and is still active, according to SentinelOne. It’s unclear who’s behind this cyberespionage operation, but Shamir said it’s likely a government from Eastern Europe, with a lot of resources and skills. The malware’s developers were very familiar with Windows; they knew it “to the bone,” according to him. “This was not the work of a kid,” he said. “It was cyberespionage at its best.”"

The agenda mixes arcane tech-talk with muscular power-politics: who sets the rules in cyberspace, and how are they enforced? But chatter in the corridors will be about events in neighbouring Finland. Hackers made a sophisticated attempt to steal credentials of staff at the country’s largest media company, Sanoma. And in April a crude swamping attack (DDoS in geek-speak) hit the defence ministry’s website. Both, unsurprisingly, are blamed on Russia, which is irked by Finland’s strengthening security ties with America. Estonians—famously hawkish about their eastern neighbour—will be dispensing advice on that, and on the country’s pioneering use of the blockchain (encrypted, decentralised data storage) for personal data and transactions.

A country would either have to openly admit to committing cyber attacks and those attacks would need to be sufficient to justify sanctions before sanctions would be imposed. I don't think it is very likely to occur. Any country implicated in some cyber attack would only need to show a reasonable doubt that they ordered the attacks to fend off sanctions.

The president initially made the declaration on April 1, 2015, as part of an executive order that empowered the Treasury Department to levy sanctions on individuals or entities behind cyberattacks and cyber espionage. The move was an attempt to impose costs on foreign hackers who have peppered the U.S. with cyberattacks for years with few repercussions. The sanctions would effectively freeze targets's assets when they pass through the U.S. financial system and prohibit them from transacting with American companies. Obama said Treasury would retain these powers for at least another year, given the pervasive cyber threat that remains."""

2965,2016-03-30T20:54:57Z,33,[100.0],[0.0],Actually this question is quite instructive as to how sanctions work. Imposing more sanctions on Iran or DPRK is pounding rubble. No additional sanctions can add to whatever deterrent effects of the current sanctions.For the forseeable future no compliance officer at an American financial institution will do business even though complex intermediaries with any entity private or public. Rather than quibble about sanctions being applied for cyber by US it is forseeable that EU actors would impose such sanctions as attacks are ongoing. It may well be that the crowd equates cyber with nuclear threats. Deterrence of cyber attacks by sanctions and public disclosuse of a cyber attack are seen by the crowd as unlikely. The sanctions issue is more likely to arise than a disclosed attack on a nuclear facility. The correct answer should be 0 because it amounts to a nuclear attack which is unthinkable. I would reduce my forecast to 10 where solid expert opinion is if the unthinkable did not occur multiple times in Pakistan India Ukraine Instead I am reducing to 75 percent on time alone. Sanctions for cyber attacks are almost certain to occur if a NATO or EU country wishes to name and shame for ongoing attacks on non nuclear facilities.

The odds of an unprompted major cyber attack are relatively low by themselves. However, based on China's actions against GitHub last year, as well as the attack on Ukraine's power plant, there is still a significant chance of it happening.

While initial observations would indicate payoff as the goal of such attacks, it appears to me that these attacks have targeted organizations with resources sufficient to defend themselves but without resources sufficient to go after the perpetrators. From a programming development standpoint it appears these attacks are more of a test of skill than an actual desire for the payout. This would indicate a large, probably state-sponsored, organization that is testing out new intrusion methodologies. As such, the prospect of state-sponsored attacks increases the likelihood of charges related to such attacks. Mitigating factors include the political fallout associated with such a charge, as well as the difficulty of a government convincing its citizenry that such an attack occurred and was committed by a particular state actor."

On the flip side, the IC will be able to use the IoT for ""identification, surveillance, monitoring, location tracking, and targeting for recruitment."" An increasing reliance on ""Narrow AI"" systems, that perform specialized tasks, can both increase efficiency but leave systems open to disruption. Overreliance on these systems, or a lack of securing them properly, could lead to ""disruptive or deceptive tactics."" As an example, stock market fluctuations have happened due to automated trading systems taking in false data, Clapper notes. Hackers and foreign military cyber actors will seek to exploit the integrity of networked and online information. This runs the gamut from modifying and transmitting false data to public utilities and market firms, to implanting false information on online media. Foreign nations are increasingly buying and exploiting aggregated online personal data tp ""inform a variety of counterintelligence operations."" There is still little impetus for countries to restrain themselves in cyber operations. ""Many actors remain undeterred from conducting reconnaissance, espionage, and even attacks in cyberspace because of the relatively low costs of entry, the perceived payoff, and the lack of significant consequences.""

There will most likely be cyber attacks and cyber espionage, there may even be threats of sanctions in response. The problem is that it is fiendishly fraught to assign blame to a state for one of these attacks. The nature of cyber attacks means that the responsible party is obscured. So the first thing we would need to see this year is a significant cyber attack that warrants state-level sanctions. As soon as it happens (I'd give it 30% chance in the next 12 months), the clock is then ticking for the investigation to start and conclude within the calendar year. Most likely this investigation would take several months, and I'm willing to predict that it would take more than 6 months, and 80% chance a year or longer. Then there would be a lot of political bluster and posturing before imposition of sanctions; might take a week to two months maybe? So with an attack needing to occur in the first half of the year for a low chance for a conclusion and imposition of sanctions within 2016, I give the overall chance of this a low score."

1639,2015-12-29T16:28:42Z,2,[45.0],[-9.0],"I think the term “Cyber Attack” s a bit too vague. There are different types of cyber-ofenses: Cyber-attack is any type of offensive maneuver employed by individuals or whole organizations that targets computer information systems, infrastructures, computer networks, and/or personal computer devices by various means of malicious acts usually originating from an anonymous source that either steals, alters, or destroys a specified target by hacking into a susceptible system. This type of attack can be perpetrate by a group of teens with too much free time; by professional hackers working on their own or for a country; or by legitimate countries. Cyber spying, or cyber espionage, is the act or practice of obtaining secrets without the permission of the holder of the information (personal, sensitive, proprietary or of classified nature), from individuals, competitors, rivals, groups, governments and enemies for personal, economic, political or military advantage. CE, well almost every country does it, In fact in September 2015, the United States and China agreed not to allow parties in their nations to cyberspy on each other for commercial gain, but did not prohibit government spying. Cyber-terrorism is “the use of computer network tools to shut down critical national infrastructures (such as energy, transportation, government operations) or to coerce or intimidate a government or civilian population. CT is the most dangerous one. We could split hairs even more than that, but it should suffice for now."

One possibility might be that it would be a ban of an entire set or class of individual or corporate types originating from within a particular country based on product or service. For example, as with the Russian reverse-sanction-sanction of banning importation of food categories from selected countries. Would a ban in the United States on the importation of any rug made in Iran be a sanction on Iran or the carpet-makers? Provided the ban is universal (""all carpets from X"") I think we could say it was a sanction against X, not just the carpet-makers. So, what universal-type bans would be an appropriate response for a cyber-attack? There's also a difference between export and import bans. They may have comparable symbolism, but export bans are more difficult to enforce. Further, there is also consideration of the specific nature of the economic trade existing between the two relevant nations. Sanctions on the importation of product A from country X might be quite strong, if the export of product A by country X is meaningful. So, in particular circumstances, tying matchsticks or coconuts to cyber-attacks might not be far-fetched at all. Bans on imports also usually incur some cost to the importer. So sanctions, via bans, are a rich area with a lot of flexibility ranging over symbolism to economic effects. If cyber warfare continues as it has, no doubt such cyber-sanctions are to follow. Perhaps there is a joint NSA, Treasury, State department working group within the U.S. actively developing a framework for these now. At this point, however, I haven't caught wind of any such framework. There is also the complication that cyber-warfare is handled within the military command structure, so an integrated economic response might be out of the realm of their expertise, and not even a part of their solution domain."

In April, Obama signed an executive order calling for impose economic sanctions on individuals and entities that take part in or benefit from illicit cyber-activities such as commercial espionage. “If the indictments had the effect of getting the PLA to scale down, then sanctions likely will have a wider effect on other Chinese state-sponsored groups,” says another expert. http://www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com/dr20151214-following-indictments-china-s-military-reduces-its-commercial-cybeespionage-against-american-companies"

I think China will use a similar strategy to its use of fishermen on the front lines in S China Sea, using commercial entities to conduct commercial cyber espionage so that any sanctions would fall on that corporation or private entity instead of the state.
