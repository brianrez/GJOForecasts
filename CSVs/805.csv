True to a certain degree. Merkel and others wanted Laschet or Spahn, not him.

Merz is more likely than Lanchet to offer himself as number two in a ticket with Soder. Lanchet has lost popularity with the voters due his performance during the Covid-19 lockdown. The Novichok/Navalny has raised the profile of Rottgen with conservatives by hardening Germany’s approach to Russia and could provide a good number two to Soder’s softer approach as a potential ticket. It would appear that the CDU is looking to elect the best running mate for Soder as opposed to a Leader/Chancellor.

He also stated once more, how important that congress will be for the party and its compliance with German party law, and that all options, including virtualization, are considered and precautions are being taken to make it happen. Negotiations for necessary changes in German party law (that currently prevent virtual congresses from being recognized as such) have started, so I exclude the option of another postponement or cancellation from now on. Armin Laschet (CDU, Northrhine-Westphalia MP) was recently visited by Angela Merkel in his state, which was reminiscent of Merkel's visit to Markus Söder and his state government in mid-July. He showed her the remains of the industrial heritage of the Ruhrgebiet (e.g. Zeche Zollverein in the city of Essen) instead of baroque gilden castles, which may point to his intention to be more eligible to work class and middle class-people. First and foremost, it appears to show Merkel's support and approval for Laschet, however not exclusively for Laschet. I still favor Röttgen for his deep knowledge and understanding of foreign policy, which seems crucial in this age of virulent, interwoven and complex conflicts, he'd also stand for continuity in one of Merkel's leitmotifs, ""Ausgleich"" (balance). However, there's a fine line to inactivity and hesitation he'd have to overcome. I still can't imagine Friedrich Merz's successful comeback into politics - no way. I can't imagine Merkel showing her approval of his ahead of the Parteitag either, so there will be no visit to Friedrich Merz whatsoever - where should Merkel travel, to his private yacht in the Mediterranean? Where would they meet, in ""Haus Sauvigny"" in Brilon, where his old money family has been seated? https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haus_Sauvigny In times like these, having no responsibility and thus no opportunity to prove one's capacity is a big handicap. The only way out for Merz is his close ties to all sorts of industrial lobby groups, which start to play and polarize between unions and employers, whine for subsidies, warn of bankruptcies, layoffs and a futures lack of vocational education spots or simply demand more taxpayers' money or outright tax cuts. They've done so at all times, in good and bad times, in boom and bust, so it wouldn't mean a thing - except more pressure on ""green"" regulation and other rational policies, all of which Friedrich Merz would happily deliver."

Soeder seemed to be saying, from the articles I read, ""no"" out of one side of his mouth, and ""yes"" out of the other for moving to national politics and out of Bavaria. Is that common behavior for Germany politicians? Or is Soeder particularly odd for keeping his options open?"""

However there are two questions following from his/her list of weaknesses of the candidates (and I agree at least Merz and Laschet would lead to significant losses for the CDU, if not immediately then through their sheer incompetence): - Who will be elected by the party officials (which most likely don't agree with our analysis)? - If none of the current candidates are deemed competent enough: Who else will seek and take the leadership role?"
