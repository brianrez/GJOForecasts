So desperate to defend the indefensible, FBI sources are disclosing wire-tap on HRC staff member and these anonymous source did commit a federal felony. Better stay anonymous. Disclosing the existence of a wire tap as well as info from is a serious federal felony These constant unauthorized leaks are a violation of FBI RULES, DOJ Rules and US statute and US Supreme Court rulings for a political purpose. That is how desparate FBI key personel have become. This info like FBI 302s is confidential and highly unreliable. It took decades to dislodge Hoover and mak the FBI accountable to Rule of law and non-poltical. Clearly Comey has to go and now his agency has reverted back to a Poltical police force and this potentially will subvert our justice system. I expect the leakers to suffer the same charges and penalties that they allege HRC should have. Plus obstrucion of justice. With these leaks, it will be impossible to convict anyone subject to this Keystone Cop-GRU investigation. HRC polls are showing Trump crossing trend line in Iowa and Florida, and VA and NC d Iowa those states appear gone. But Nevada is a toss up-likely Clinton as with VA and NC and New Hampshire SO just as in Brexit we have trendlines crossing in 5 key battleground states. But I give DT AZ, GA, FLA,Ohio, This race will be determined not in FLA or Ohio but in NC, Nevada, PA, and VA, and NH DT needs to win PA, he is far short. Clinton can win so many ways. But HRC still has 6 paths to 272. Trump must still run table. He needs PA, cannot get. HRC needs PA and Virginia and Colorado which are makeable. DT needs NC , VA and FLA and NH to win and Ohio No way, assuming Dems equal turnout from Obama. Early voting means nothing in those states, unless you assume the voters are highly partisan and voted early out of intense opposition. Please be clear, there is still a 1 in 20 chance to 5 in 20 chance DT will win. So a forecaster could be between 75-95 for HRC BASED ON TURNOUT ASSUMPTIONs HRC wins as DT had no ground qame, will be outspent 3/1 in more battleground states. HRC ground qame will win VA, NV, NC, PA,"

Important in that not only were partisan supporters watching, assumes a high percentage of independents and undecideds as well. Hillary’s good, 1st-round showing captures more of these votes. - Trump was significantly damaged on two key demographics: African-Americans and women. His response on the Birther question killed him on the first. His overbearing attitude toward Clinton and response to her baiting on his past remarks about women on the second. On visuals, how about this scenario: Fade in. Mr. and Mrs. America are watching the debate. Trump waving his hands and interrupting. Clinton: ”I have a feeling that by the end of the evening, I will be blamed for everything that's ever happened."" Trump (snarky): ""Why not?"" Clinton: ”Why not, yeah, why not? Mr. America: “Haha….. go get ’er, Donald!” Mrs. America (rolling her eyes and thinking): Gosh, Almighty. Trump acts like my Cletus after I burn the meatloaf, put too much starch in his BVDs or put Twinkies into his lunchbox instead of the Ho-Hos.” Fade out. - On Tuesday’s close, major US stock indices (Dow, Nasdaq, SP500) up higher on perceived Clinton performance. - Noticed a change in the Clinton ads for Seattle. Running the ‘ordinary Americans’ ads with veterans and women (the ‘us’ versus ‘him’). Good switchover by Team Clinton. First Trump ad airing now (pretty darn late….. what’s up with the RNC?)."

Once the moderator asked a question which had implications which might impugn his personality, however, and further lured from that point forward by Clinton with personal jabs, Trump reverted to his same old name-calling and buffoonery. He is, after all, or so he at least claims, a counter-puncher. His counter-punching did not serve him well. He had the initiative and he lost it. • Trump hammered on specific job and economic examples (e.g. an unfair tax differential between Mexico and the U.S., which actually impedes fair trade, to the detriment of the United States), Clinton responded with generalities and platitudes, and invoked the old ""independent experts"" mantra. I was so waiting for the famous Michael Gove comeback (""I think people in this country have had enough of experts""), but it was not to be. Trump missed his chance to obtain an early knockout blow on economic policy. Clinton was on the ropes, she was going to stand behind NAFTA, and he let her off the hook. NAFTA supporters consider free trade a system to be maximized. If you're a proper leader, you'd think of NAFTA as a mechanism by which the system of free trade could be optimized for the benefit of your country. In the latter case, NAFTA has failed miserably. • Trump, when pressed by Clinton on his business management practices, more-or-less 'fessed up to screwing over the suppliers, vendors, and contractors that he uses. Trump implied it was all OK, because he only ""took advantage of the laws of the nation."" The ""rule of law"" is not justice, and screwing over contractors is inflicting harm. Laborers and sole proprietor contractors don't have the wherewithal to challenge the likes of Trump in court for a ten thousand dollar contract dispute. So Trump screws over a hundred contractors for ten thousand dollars each, and it adds up. When injustice is done, and the system allows those who have perpetrated the injustice to get away with it (impunity), resentment against not only the wrongdoer, but the society at large ensues. We all pay the price for such improper behavior. First, we finance the legal system that enables such practices; and secondly, such practices sap the spirit of goodwill, efficiency, and fair dealing that are necessary for a coherent society, thus feeding the false narrative of zero-sum transactional economics. It's a crappy business practice (it's plain theft buttressed with intimidation under color of law); but hey, that's Trump. • In response to a question on race relations and ""bridging the racial divide"" (which, of course, presupposes that such a divide in fact exists), neither candidate addressed the question, and both quickly answered with criminal justice and enforcement plans (""law and order""). My goodness. Doesn't that just speak tons about how those candidates truly feel about race relations! The fact is, race relations are generally good, the minority communities are suffering the effect of the economic depression more so than the population as a whole, and the issue is therefore an economic issue. Crime is a separate issue. • Both candidates plan to spit on the Second Amendment by disallowing citizens that are on the so-called ""terrorist watchlist"" from obtaining weapons. This, of course, is hogwash, for not only does it fly in the face of the language of the Second Amendment itself (""the right ... shall not be infringed""), but the very purpose of the Second Amendment was to protect the citizenry from a government that runs amok. You can't very well then give to the government the right to create a secret watchlist (or any list for that matter) that prevents that right from being exercised! But this whole debate was a tour de force in muddled thinking. • Trump is all good with the idea that the priority mission of NATO should be re-purposed so as to combat terrorism. In fact, Trump would like to claim this new direction for NATO to be a result of his idea and prompting. This is not good news for those that believe the entire terrorist phenomenon is an intentionally constructed narrative to distract and deceive. Once Trump connects his self-esteem with an issue, rationality goes out the window. • Trump continued to seek to differentiate himself as not being a ""professional politician,"" and repeatedly associated Clinton with a class of ""political hacks"" that have made poor economic and foreign policy decisions. Clinton invoked her panic button-like catch all ""fact checker"" squad. When confronted with the notion that her ""experience,"" claimed to be related to poor policy decisions, was not something to be touted, Clinton sheepishly chose not to argue the case. It was a perfect opportunity for her to dive in to her accomplishments, but her silence surrendered the point. • I imagine each candidate gets to select some number of audience attendees. Trump keeps rolling out Don King, the boxing promoter. Professional boxing in the United States, since at least the 1920s, has been routinely fixed. I think the selection of King by Trump speaks volumes as to what Trump values. • Perhaps it was the stress of Clinton trying to land a last minute blow when the clock was ticking down, but the accusation that Trump believes ""women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as a man"" somehow left me with, ""Well, yeah. So?"" I guess the accusation might be that Trump thinks that it is conceivable that women in general are not capable of performing as well as men, but this is not what he said; and the real principle must be that the pay is based on the job, whatever that is, irrespective of the sex (or whatever other characteristic) of the worker. So I think Trump was trying to articulate the principle, and the over-reaching by Clinton came across as reaching for straws. • Trump cited a Clinton reference as springing from ""the mainstream media."" Just as Trump has done with free trade, for a major party presidential candidate to even utter those words in a nationally televised debate, in the totally controlled propaganda environment that is the United States, opens up the minds of millions of citizens, and gives them permission to even contemplate the notion of a national media dominated by ""political hacks."" • The prognostication by Trump during the primaries that he would ""crush"" Clinton in a one-on-one debate proved false. In fact, in terms of debate finesse, Clinton clearly had the better of Trump by luring him away from policy issues into personal areas where he felt challenged and responded immaturely. • In his closing remarks, Trump made a vague reference to some potential new accusation of Clinton scandal that, apparently, is so bad that even he, Donald Trump, felt it was in better taste to avoid mentioning. Then, of course, why did he mention it? It was a panic move, but maybe it appeals to soap opera fans. I don't know. Is this campaign a soap opera or a cartoon? • All in all it was a disappointing exhibition, with no knockout blow from either candidate, The good news is that neither candidate broke out of the cartoon character stereotype, so there's still a chance for a third party miracle!"

What strikes me most forcefully is the number of views of this one day old video: ~570,000. That seems like a lot. Maybe it's a fake number. Then I notice that the DAY OLD video already has 3,500+ comments. So, I'm thinking, OK, this is real. Now while half a million views of a day old video may not seem like much by itself, I've also noticed that Mr. Seaman is just one of many, many young (~30 ish) people that are expressing a rather sophisticated (e.g., ""gaslighting,"" ""propaganda,"" ""deception,"" etc.) anti-globalist message. I must ask myself: Is there possibly a real ""wave"" of sentiment in that agegroup that has not broken through the mainstream unpopulist media narrative? I don't know. I wonder what sources there might be that would track the viewership of such ""new political celebrities"" across the entire internet. So half a million views may not compare to the XXX million of MSNBC viewers head-to-head, but how many Mr. Seamans are there out there? I had never heard of him before today. How many others are out there that I have never heard of, perhaps each with similar followings? Is there *really* such a discrepancy between the ""popular mindset"" and the ""propagandist narrative"" as he (and his number of followers) suggests?

Many community leaders are stepping back from full-throated endorsements of Clinton (""make up your own mind""), while others are even going so far as to support the ABC movement (""make up your own mind, so long as it's Anybody But Clinton""). The only voice I have seen that is solidly and consistently behind Clinton is Black Lives Matter, and this group I would classify as an extreme radical (on the verge of violence) far-left element.* All other voices, including both mainstream and strongly activist (albeit non-violent) voices in this community seem to be genuinely undecided (or perhaps better stated, not so strongly committed). In this respect the black community mirrors the nation as a whole. Trump just needs to do *something* for these disaffected black (historically-)Democratic voters for them to break ranks en masse with the local Democratic party machines and vote for him come November. He has not found the ""magic symbol"" for this yet. (-1 Dem / +1 Other) http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/05/us/politics/young-blacks-voice-skepticism-on-hillary-clinton-worrying-democrats.html"

Out of 200 simulations with state results independent, all 200 went to Clinton.

Trump has surprised as a billionaire anti-establishment candidate, and could win if fear wild cards appear and they fall his way but he now looks less attractive as the reality of approaches of a president ""outside normal parameters"" even for P.J. O'Rourke confronts voters. Importantly- while most Australian's and our media may think Trump is a figure of fun - we don't vote and don't count.

Democrats need only win the same states that they picked up in the last 4 elections (solid blue) plus Florida. Failing to pick up Florida can be solved by picking up Ohio + Pennsylvania.

The base rate problem: of the 34 historical elections between R and D, R's have won 18 to D's 16 - this is the most favorable base rate to D - since it includes the FDR years, etc., but it is unrealistic, as the current balance (southern states being almost exclusively red) happened with Kennedy and beyond.

Trump announced at a rally of his he likes clean coal and promises to bring back the coal industry. HRC on the other hand opposes the coal industry and is promising to end the coal industry in the US. See the youtube videos of both candidates describing their positions on coal. I figured I'd watch KOL the symbol for the exchange traded fund for coal as well as these coal mining stocks SXC, CLD, CNX, ARLP and CNXC. Below I have have a link for my stockcharts.com monthly KOL chart. You will notice approximately the same time Trump stated his position on coal the industry stock prices have rallied significantly. Maybe this is just a coincidence? But if there is a correlation and Trump wins the smart money will invest heavily in the coal industry and we will see it in KOL and others. I will go a step further and say I expect KOL to pull back over the next few months then rally to new highs up to $15 area. If this happens I suspect Trump will be the next POTUS."

Starting with Ike, there have been a total of six presidential elections in which the same party held the white house for the previous two terms, and of those six, only one, Bush 1, managed to win a third term for his party. So 5/6=83% in favor of a republican. Since Bush v Gore was so close, I nudged it to 4.75/6=79% as my baseline. I'll admit starting with Ike is a bit arbitrary, but FDR's long run by no means happened in ordinary circumstances, and the further back we go, the more different the political landscape was."

Then I read it. Many commenters make great points about the targeting of supporters and I agree that there are some inconvenient truths. First failure of most NATO allies to burden share at 2% GDP.Two that recent interventions Libya and Iraq 2 were disasters above and apart from the tragic loss of Chris Stevens and other State personnel at Benghazi. 3.) It is an attempt to restate a ""realist foreign policy"" Need to examine more but initially after hearing confirmed by reading; the speech is not only inconsistent but incoherent as a whole. 1.) It conveniently ignores the immense contribution of our allies to NATO's worldwide interests and its, necessity as common defense against Russia and numerous transnational threats such as terrorism, cyber-security, and immigration. For example France under both Sarkoky and his socialist sucessor Hollande, aided by a brilliant Fabius, in Chad, Burkina Faso, Cote D'Ivoire etc. This is but one example of where our allies have boots on the ground in support of core American interests. 2.) Clinton is a hawk. Trump's speech may sound like a return to ""realism"" and a multi-polar world but why have such a large military if no interventions are forseeable. Kissinger would not recognize it as realism and it has resulted in revulsion by a bi-partisan or non-partisan elite that actually runs our national security establishment. 3.) It may be tailored to motivate Trump supporters in his base, but its just one more reason that the thought of Trump with his finger on the trigger will be resoundingly repudiated for demographic reasons and turnout alone."

Trump channels the frustration that the American public feels, into a rally cry for change. Lower median wages, automatization of labor, the sharing economy, outsourcing to China, corporate excesses have made people feel powerless. Hillary represents the establishment, and voting on her does not help alleviate the feeling of frustration. Voting for Trump might. Hillary is not a likable person, although her last name might have positive associations in some voters' minds. Trump is also entertaining, interesting and provides hope for change. I believe that his support for protectionism and building walls against Mexico resonates with voters - it provides a feeling of being cared for and supported. Voters who on an intellectual level realize the dangers of such policies are very few and are unlikely to impact the election to any major extent. There has been a recent trend of populist candidates winning elections, from Austria to Sweden to the Philippines (most likely). Google Trend search query numbers indicate significantly higher interest in Trump than Hillary. Nate Silver was originally negative on Trump's chances of winning the election, potentially causing other forecasters on this website to become skeptical about his chances. However Nate recently conceded that Trump against all expectations have beaten his polling averages in the last six states. Just like Duterte seems likely to win the Philippines elections, I believe that Trump will beat the low expectations with progressively higher polls and ultimately win the election in November"

A stronger (more ""moderate"", better-connected) candidate like Bloomberg would draw off more Clinton votes. A weaker independent candidate (like any of the now side-lined Republicans) would affect Clinton less.

I'm increasing the odds of a 3rd party victory based on the electoral college rules and the GOP's ever-increasing frustration with Trump. If an establishment Republican were to run independently or if a majority of the GOP threw their endorsements behind someone like Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, it could make the race much more uncertain. Trump may get some of the Bernie Sanders anti-establishment supporters who don't like Clinton. Trump and Clinton both have poor favorability ratings. A popular third party or independent candidate might be able to pick up enough support to win some states and prevent Trump or Clinton from reaching the necessary 270 electoral votes. The vote would then go to the Republican-controlled House, who could vote against the Republican for the other conservative candidate. Is this GOP establishment pipe dream likely? Not at all. Neither is Trump winning, but this has been an unprecedented election year thus far. Who knows..."

Based on what I hear from Sanders voters and see at Sanders events, Clinton will struggle to get the voters of a significant minority of Sanders supporters. It's hard to imagine the people who are actively booing her at his events accepting her as the candidate, no matter how much Sanders campaigns for Clinton. She's deeply unpopular and has alienated significant sections of the Democratic coalition. Low voter turnout (among Democrats) is Trump's key to victory. A Clinton candidacy in the general election may mean low voter turnout. That said, I'm still favoring a Democratic victory in November by a healthy margin. Trump will struggle in debates with someone who isn't bound by his party's policy idiocy. Will it matter to American voters?"

This should give him a huge advantage when it comes to the presidential election, but that may not be the case. In most of the polls that I have seen, 30% of Republicans would select Clinton OVER Trump in a presidential election. However, an average of 1.5 times MORE people are voting at Republican Primaries and caucuses, while about 1.3 times LESS people are voting at Democratic events. If this trend continues for the Presidential election, there will be 20% more Republicans than Democrats this election than last election. In a recent poll 30% of Republicans would vote for Hillary OVER Trump, but also, 20% of Democrats would vote for Trump OVER Hillary. Take Donald's 20% increase minus Hillary's 30% increase plus Trump's 20% increase, and you come up with 10% more people voting for Trump than Clinton."

It will be more challenging now that there is open rebellion in the Republican party. With Hilary being the likely (70% chance) democratic candidate, running on an Anti-Trump platform will make it easier for her to bring Sanders supporters into her camp and getting people out to vote. I also do not want to completely underestimate Trump in the general election. He has been underestimated up until this point. He has tapped into a strong level of dissatisfaction with the status quo amongst voters who have propelled him to the front runner of the Republican party. This strong emotional appeal will give him a chance in November by turning out voters who have sat out previous presidential elections."

However if DT vs BS, I think you would be nearer a 60:40 (to DT). BS can't compete outside of hardcore DEM territory, so at a national level is not competitive, and is too easily tarred as 'socialist' which I'm told American's really, really fear. I think its probably a 75:25 thing between HC and BC now, so that gives us 78:22 from our decision-tree. I suppose there's an outside chance of an independent 3rd candidate, either DT himself (if he's somehow pushed out by the GOP) or some kind or disgruntled moderate Republican if DT is nominated.

Independent and Trump v. Sanders v. Independent. (Independent here mostly meaning Michael Bloomberg but not exclusively). Clinton has to be seen as the heavy favourite to win the Democrat nod; Sanders is well back of the thresholds set out by 538 for him to win the nomination. I'd say it's 75-80% she wins. If she does, the likelihood of an independent bid is quite low, as it has been reported that Bloomberg is unlikely to enter the race unless it is a Sanders v. Trump bid. In a head-to-head match, Clinton's favourability ratings are far higher than Trump's and have been for some time and both are well-known figures within the general electorate so it seems valid to give Clinton a substantial lead; I'm guessing but I'd say this by a 2:1 margin. In the event of a Sanders victory, the situation becomes much less clear. Bloomberg's history of prevarication needs to be factored in, and another prominent independent candidate seems unlikely. Even in this case I'd say it's only 40% that Bloomberg even runs. Sanders is nowhere near as well known as Clinton, so favourability ratings may lie and the head-to-head polling at this point is rarely predictive. I don't know how to resolve this clash of unlikely candidates. I'm inclined to give Sanders a slight edge because Trump's favourability numbers are so bad and I'm also inclined to factor in a small chance of a win by Bloomberg or some other independent candidate in this scenario."

The real question is, will more people vote *for* him than vote *against* him because he's a crass buffoon? Any other year I would regard his chances as nonexistent. But this year is clearly different. I think the qualities that repel many voters will induce even more voters to go with Trump.
