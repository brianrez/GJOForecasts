However there are lots of things that could happen between now and Feb to change things so not going to estimate too high. Basically I'm back where I started with my initial forecast before I started reading about how fewer naval exercises take place in the winter...which I probably shouldn't have weighted as highly as I did.

I know there's some lively debate on interpretation of the question, but I'm pretty sure Russia and China at minimum have to be participants in the exercise. @LCBC2020 shared a very helpful resource that outlines the history of Russia-China naval exercises through June 2019. These occur on an annual basis but according to this source have NEVER taken place in the months of October-March in any region, most likely due to winter weather. That is, until December 2019, when Russia-China-Iran executed an unprecedented combined exercise in the Gulf of Oman. I intend to do more research into more geopolitical factors in play at this time for future updates. The base rate is tricky on this one. 11 exercises in 94 months can mean a 0.117 chance of an exercise each month. However, only 1/11 exercises took place between the months of November and March (if you go back to 2012). Without knowing more operational details about how debilitating winter weather is to these exercises, I will accept the 1/11 rate. The fact that the most recent combined exercise took place in 2019 may indicate a new precedent for winter exercises being set that may invalidate this low track record of winter exercises, but not certain at this time how. I think it's safe to play down the role of COVID somewhat, considering that China participated in the Caucasus 2020 exercise in September 2020. Assuming that each month there's a 0.01 chance (0.09*0.117), and there are ~3.5 months in play for this question (1/2Nov-Feb), I think there's a 3.68% chance of ""yes"" through the cutoff for this question."

Based on the possibility that the joint exercise could occur with any TWO or more nations one of which must be Russia or China and the new information that a joint exercise could include a third country my outlook changes dramatically. Given that an exercise could now occur in the warmer southernly latitudes and bereft of holistic base rate information, but now knowing that China and Russia both do several joint naval exercises per year. The number of exercises appears to be around 4 though the information is hard to come by as @Rad4Caster stated. This is a 109 day period of a year (29.8%).

Of these past exercises, they have all occurred between April and Sept, save for a one 2019 China-Russia-Iran exercise in the Gulf of Oman in Dec 2019. Assuming summer months are favored due to weather and sea states in most of the areas where these exercises occur would make a winter exercise unlikely, with the exception of more equatorial waters (like the SCS or Gulf of Oman). The 2019 exercise may have also been a particular response to rising US(Saudi Arabia)-Iran tensions at the time, so should not necessarily be judged as a normal part of the long-term trend/rate. Additionally, the current pandemic adds additional barriers to organizing and conducting large military exercises, making them less likely overall. On the other hand, rising US-Chinese tensions and rising provocativeness of US presence/actions in the SCS may prompt China to use more naval exercises to send strong signals and assert more control in the region. They may seek Russian participation to bolster the messaging. http://cimsec.org/russia-china-naval-cooperation-in-an-era-of-great-power-competition/36773"

96784,2020-11-13T00:22:34Z,1,[35.0],[35.0],"This question’s base rate is difficult to nail down because it is closely tied to complex relationships between multiple nations. Realist balance-of-power considerations versus institutional and regional relationship-building considerations provide different potential outcomes, all of which would require an in-depth understanding of Chinese and Russian decision-making. In addition to the linked exercises, Russia and China have collaborated in multilateral (not bilateral) land exercises as recently as September 2020 (1) and conducted naval drills alongside Iran in 2019(2). Factors related to the 'why' behind participation in previous and potential future exercises are important; Russian and Chinese courtship of Iranian energy reserves and desires to independently appear as benevolent players amongst Eurasian states are potential explanations of their 'joint' participation in the previous exercises and may therefore not be useful indicators of why Russia and China might participate in bilateral exercises. Conversely, this *broadens* the reasons why Russia and China might be tempted to participate in multilateral activities in areas of mutual benefit, though areas of mutual benefit that also facilitate naval exercises in particular limits the list a lot. Arctic cooperation seems unlikely because of unease on both sides about monopoly, though @fueled_by_gummybears point on non-military exercises raises the overall chances of this event significantly. This is because Russia-China non-military Arctic cooperation is subtle, relatively non-threatening, and “threads the needle” on several concerns I raise below. Some factors that may make joint naval exercises less likely are related to Russia-China competition over energy (China as a consumer, Russia as producer), competition for primacy in the Arctic, Russian concerns over Chinese theft of technology (3), and especially over the dynamics of China as a rising great+ power and Russia as a struggling middle+ power. These may provide incentives on either side (especially the Russian) not to desire an exercise. China may see value in demonstrating closer cooperation with Russia, given hardening relationships with India and other regional powers. From a realist perspective, Russia is incentivized to allow China to be counter-balanced by India and other local powers. From an economic perspective, Russia may indeed be incentivized to cooperate with China to increase energy exports to China. However, this is again mitigated by a Russia that is most likely concerned that China has many sources of energy and material from numerous middle eastern and African nations due to investment by general Chinese businesses, state-owned enterprises, and CCP-sponsored BRI initiatives. In this situation, a savvy Russia might want China to be counterbalanced to create a longer-term balance against China that is of more value than a short-term increase in Russian exports. Either China or Russia may see an opportunity to demonstrate concordance against a new US administration, which could be perceived as threatening by the United States without much concomitant gain for either Russia or China. Threatening the US through this kind of action potentially supports a new US administration in forming domestic and/or international consensus' against Russia and/or China. It would have to be accompanied by some pretty important gains for Russia and China in return. I could see an energy deal reaching this bar for Russia, but I also see it being at odds with China’s traditional strategy of appearing non-threatening. (4) This entire line of thought is undermined because minor naval exercises, especially including non-military ones, are not all that big a deal. Neither Russia nor China have recently shown a desire to cooperate as peers with other great or near-great powers.."

This year Russia, China, and a few other nations conducted a land exercise in Southern Russia (Kavkaz), so this may fulfill the foreign joint exercise objectives for both nations. This is not to say that Chinese and Russian joint exercises are limited to one per year, but with COVID still very active in Russia it is likely to diminish the likelihood of other exercises this year. Russia expended considerable resources preventing COVID outbreaks for the recent Kavkaz, which is not surprising since it is their a part of their annual capstone exercise series. I do not assess Russia will invest the same amount of resources to partake in an exercise that does not have the same level of prestige or importance to the Russian military establishment. Additionally, I have not seen any indications or announcements of planning trips between China and Russia for joint naval operations. However, this is not something that is usually reported (if at all) until about a month before the exercise is set to take place, so I will have to keep checking for updates or alerts."

Additionally, the countries' overall level of satisfaction with the partnership may be waning. With this backdrop, it is important to note that military exercises remain ongoing, with the most recent occurring in September with Caucasus 2020, and seems to be the only major exercise in 2020 and was not primarily naval. However, 2019 saw two China-Russia engage in two primarily maritime exercises with one occurring in April and a second in late December. This second exercise was conducted with Iran in the Gulf of Oman and Indian Ocean and may provide some signal that it could reoccur this year as well. However, there are reasons to think that Russia and China (and Iran) will utilize the following four months as part of an information-gathering phase regarding US intentions. The recent US DOD shakeup and tense Presidential election make the US an arguably less predictable international actor until the beginning of the new presidential term. Compounding the issue is the possibility that Iran may attempt to strike back at the US in retaliation for the strike on Soleimani, and neither Russia nor China would likely want to be seen as supportive. They will likely remain concerning until well into its first 100 days. These factors: the mildly strained China-Russia relationship, Iranian tensions, and US unpredictability make a joint naval exercise in the near term unlikely."

I also can't find anything about the seasonality of this type of exercise so I don't know if winter/early spring is a timeframe that makes a difference. Knowing that large multinational naval exercises take quite some time to plan I would assume that any exercises for the remainder of 2020 or beginning of 2021 are already in the works. So if they are happening someone knows about it. looking at past combined naval exercises it looks like most of the articles predicting/announcing them came out a month or two before the exercises started, so I'd expect some articles in the next few months for an early 2021 exercise. Also any planned exercises will probably continue as planned barring a major shift in Russia China relationship--there are some articles predicting a cooling relationship between the two but I don't think that would impact a military exercise between now and March."

Therefore, it is likely that the preplanned joint exercise will occur during 2021, but after 1 March. The only exception to this would likely be as a response to a geopolitical event that is difficult to predict. For example, in 2019, Russia and China conducted a trilateral exercise with Iran in the northern Indian ocean in the last week of December, in response to US sanctions on Iran and joint US-Saudi military movements in response to RPA attacks on Saudi oil fields.

However, naval exercises must, almost certainly, involve one of three Russian formations: the Far-East/Pacific fleet in Vladivostok, the baltic fleet in Kaliningrad, or the Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol (ruling out the Russian Mediterranean Fleet in Syria due to the on-going war and the Russian North Sea Fleet due to the lack of surface vessels and extreme weather conditions in Murmansk). Two of these formations are in ports that are only semi-tenable from Nov to 1 Mar (Kaliningrad and Vladivostok) and the third in Sevastapol would require a Chinese fleet to transit to the Black Sea or the Black Sea Fleet to leave the Black Sea. Both of these propositions are very unlikely due to the distances involved, the requirement for Turkish acquiescence, and on-going disputes in Ukraine. Over the last decade, all but one of the ten joint Chinese-Russian exercises have involved the Chinese North or East Sea Fleets and the Russian Pacific Fleet. The harbor of Vladivostok is iced over during this period of most years. Additionally, no joint Russian-Chinese naval exercise has EVER occurred from 9 Nov to 1 Mar. Indeed no joint (land, air, or sea) exercise between China and Russia over the last 20 years has been held during 9 Nov - 1 Mar of more than 20 exercises. It is possible that such an event could occur, but it is HIGHLY improbable given the weather conditions, lack of historical evidence, and physical formations involved. 1% or perhaps 2% at best. Realistically the occurrence is probably closer to 0.3-0.5%, but, bereft of that option, I refuse to estimate something as a 0% likelihood of occurrence when it is feasible.

None of them have happened in the window between November and March, except the most recent one in 2019, which happened in December 2019."

Another player could be Iran who have held naval exercises with Russia and China in 2019. Biden was vice president when Obama negotiated the limitation of nuclear capability with Iran before the deal was trashed by Trump. I propose that Russia , PRC and perhaps Iran may carry out naval exercises to test the resolve of the new administration with its allies."
