His government is also accused of curtailing freedom of expression and denying media coverage to opposition political and civil leaders. These political factors coupled with poor economic growth and spiraling inflation signals instability in the country which if let unaddressed could lead to defeat of Imran Khan's party in the long term. However, these internal turmoils do not indicate that Imran Khan would cease to be prime minister of Pakistan before 8 Dec 2019. Also, Imran Khan has succeeded in highlighting and exploiting the Kashmir issue which historically has diverted attention of the public from pressing problems within. This tactic is expected to work in favour of his party this time as well."
