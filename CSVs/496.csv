Main reason is that Beijing is hosting the Winter Olympics beginning of 2022, so the CCP doesn't want to risk any boycott of games. As I understood, that would be considered as loss of the face, something which needs to be avoided in East Asian cultures at any costs. This will make clashes much more unlikely during the rest of 2021, especially talk in the US about olympic boycott is slowly bubbling the surface. So the CCP is in my assumption following a more deescaleting approach until the olympics are over. So cofrontations are highly unlikely in the rest of 2021."

I assume that Hong Kong Police Force is well staffed, equipped and trained to crack down on any pro democracy activity. I don't think that Beijing is going to deploy PLA or PAP units on active anti protest engagement in Hong Kong, because it would fuel the rising tensions in international relations and furthermore would be more damaging trade relations which are so vital for chinas economic growth especially now as more and more countries in the West and elsewhere are openly and seriously rethinking their current economic relationship with the People's Republic. The CCP is known to think more in longterm timescales and planing decades into the future. I assume that cutting economic ties would be more a struggle for the other countries in the first years but in the longrun it would be a much more serious issue for China. So sending in mainland forces just would strengthen the critics of China's trading and economic practises as well as it's human rights abuses. So just to legitimize it's role as the government party, the CCP is in the longrun more dependent on trading with other countries than they are on China. The only possibility of a confrontation is when protesters actually attacking PLA and/or PAP facilities within the SAR, but also I think this is also not a problable scenario. So deploying PLA and/or PAP I give it 1%, protesters attacking facilities is around 4%, so 5% is in my view a generous estimate."

Hong Kong residents may be held liable for any speech or action deemed secessionist, subversive, terrorist or perceived as colluding with hostile foreign political groups or individuals. Only 20 of the 90 Legislative Council members will be elected directly. Many arrests have been made with potential life sentences. High profile media tycoon Jimmy Lai and other leading pro-democracy advocates were sentenced to 18 months for organising demonstrations indicating an unprecedented crackdown by the Hong Kong and Beijing authorities. The UK has introduced a special visa program to allow a potential 300,000 Hong Kong people to emigrate. The PLA (Hong Kong garrison) conducted a military drill involving multiple services in Hong Kong that could be perceived as a signal of their presence. Therefore, it would appear that pro-democracy dissent has been legally outlawed and potential protestors are either in prison or leaving the country which makes the use, rather than just a high-profile presence, of armed military or police personnel unnecessary to enforce the governments will."
