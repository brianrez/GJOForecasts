Would need a somewhat steep rate of increase in cases to reach 340,000 now, but it is still possible in light of today being first day of resuming non-essential shopping. With only 15 days left until end of forecast, however, any one out catching virus today won't show up positive in the testing right away as estimates are that tests test more accurately for positive results 5-14 days after exposure. UK gov officials think current R is 0.7-0.9 but that would have to increase above 1.1 in the next 5 days or above 1.2 later to reach the 340,000 threshold."

Given current trends, which are slightly negative, in new cases using a 14 day avg (currently -4% daily for the last two weeks) it is getting increasingly difficult to believe that total cases will exceed 340k by the end of June. The trend would likely need to flatten quickly and increase over the next few weeks. Not improbable, just unlikely given the info available. As the lockdown eases I will be looking at the second and third weeks of June to see numbers surging to adjust my estimate appreciably toward much higher case totals(340-420 and 420k+). Otherwise, I will continue to downgrade my forecast for higher total cases."

Mobility data seems to support this. A plan for better contact tracing and isolation would increase my downside risk, while another week of new cases above trend would push me more into the upside scenario."

The UK has acted less quickly and successfully, and is unlikely to achieve better than halving numbers within 4wks from the peak, more in line with Italy or Spain.

It feels to me like there are a couple of big picture scenarios to consider. One, we have and keep this under control - effective social distancing and or contact tracing allows Government to essentially control the number of daily cases to keep the NHS from being overwhelmed. We then essentially have a choice about the trade off between the number of cases and the ""economic"" and other harm people are concerned about. We can either attempt to kill the virus as something spreading in the UK by keeping really strict measures in place - in that case, let's say we have 3k cases per day for the next 10 days, 2k cases per day for the following 10 and then sub 100 for the following 48 - that keeps us in the sub 180k bucket, but if it is even 3.5k for the next 10 days 2,750 for the following 15 and 200 for the remaining 43, that gets us above 180k. Let's say if we did choose to go down that route, we would have 75% chance of staying sub 180k and 25% chance of ending up in the 180-260k bucket. Then let's say we choose to focus more on opening things up. Let's say as above, cases gradually drop to 2k but then we allow them to stay there, that generally gets us in the 180 - 260k cases, but if misjudged a little and end up with 2.5k cases for the last 30 days on average, that gets us in the 260 - 340k bucket and even if we overrun quite a bit but still manage to get the lid back on if things go really wrong, we probably manage to keep within that bucket. However, if we ""lose control"" and get back on an exponential curve and get uncontrolled spreading, we could easily exceed the 420k cases (and that is probably more likely than the 340 - 420k cases range in that instance). So let's say if we go down that route, we are talking about a 40% chance of ending up in the 180 - 260k bucket (i.e. keeping it under control), 50% a slight misjudgement (260 - 340k) and 10% out of control (420k+). Between the try to crush it and try to have some controlled spread, I think we are probably 25/75. Putting those all together gives me 19% in sub 180k, 36% in 180-260k, 38% in 260-340k and 8% in 420k. Let's say there is also a 5% chance this is a false dawn and it is then going to be a real struggle, so we are 50/50 between 340 - 420k (i.e. things go up but we do get them back under control relatively quickly) and 420k plus (big struggle). HOWEVER, one thing I do not want to miss is that we could well start to see a real increase in testing as part of these containment measures. Let's say cases are currently unreported versus what they will be going forward and moves everything up by a bucket.. Let's say there is a 50% chance that happens. Gives me my final numbers."

There are a couple of potential variables which could increase this number: the UK does not appear to be accounting for care home related deaths which could imply increased numbers of cases; there is also pressure to end the lockdown sooner which would imply more cases; as would increased testing. However, there are also variables which could point to a lower number which are arguably more compelling: the growth rate of the increase in cases could itself be continuing to fall implying a final case number closer to 200k; similarly, the Independent has published research suggesting the total death toll by August could be as low as 23k consistent with total cases around 200k"
