Today's observed value of number of states w/ positivity >=10% (denote NUM_STATES) is a very strong forecast for tomorrow's NUM_STATES (there is a limited amount of variance left to be realized over the course of the next day). Therefore, it seemed unintuitive to try to fit a sophisticated logarithmic model or time series regression looking back historically over a significant period of time for a couple of reasons. 1.) The variance in our model prediction may far exceed the amount of variance remaining before the settlement date 2.) The most recent ""moves"" in the Covid positivity rate by day are intuitively a better prediction of tomorrow's move (historical moves looking back across a longer time may not be a good reference point for this). Thus, I will be looking at moves over the course of the last 10 days, and discount moves prior to that as a poor sample for our population parameter (today's move). Important to note: there is a trade-off here between sample size and representativeness of our sample. Last week's moves may better predict tomorrow's move better than last month's moves, but you will be drawing from a smaller sample and thus have greater variance."

Of course, reduction in the positivity rate would suggest greater numbers of people to include those with mild cases are being tested and that testing is not restricted to just the sickest in the population. Willingness to come forward will play a significant role in whether those with milder symptoms or less come forward for testing.

Of the 10 states identified earlier, the ones closest to 10% (10-12%) have increasing 7-day avg numbers. The United States as a whole has been increasing daily since an early low of 4.4% in early June. The trend is negative and therefore unlikely that the current number of 10 can be reduced in the face of growing cases, however, some states are having success which may push neighbors to follow suit so I assigned a meaningful probability to a slight decline (6-10). The states that breach 10% by September 1, 2020 could possibly replace states that exit that bucket, which given the general desire and efforts to help control the oubreak (albeit on a limited basis) I assigned a greater than 50% likelihood. Given the negative case trends, a worsening is certainly possible and I needed to assign a meaningful probability. Anything less than 15% I think would under-represent the chance of occurrence. Lastly, given the state of the pandemic, we have to acknowledge that things could spiral out of control which is why I assigned a 5% chance to 21 or more. I assigned a zero to 5 or fewer because that would require a near extinguishment of the virus from global hotspots. There is nothing that indicates to me that this is possible."

Looking at performance from other countries, its much easier to bring the test positivity rate down as compared to bringing the infections down. Many countries are now able to do this in relatively short period of time (using combination of RT-PCR, Antigen testing). India is shooting for test positivity rate no higher than 5%, and that seem to be reasonable limit. There is no shortage of test kits now. Its only matter of government focus and priority now. I see many more state governments are more willing to act now and not looking towards the federal government. I would expect the number of states with 10+ rate to go down."

Nine others would cross the 10% threshold in the timeframe on current trajectories and two are possible, but uncertain. That gives 21 as the base rate on current trends. Test numbers are increasing in almost all states; constraints in the availability of tests seem likely to bite soon. Without adequate testing renewed lockdowns (at least partial) will be required to stay ahead of the spread. In any case, the general pattern appears to be that when test availability is constrained, they are prioritised towards higher risk populations. That would tend to support the general trend towards rising Covid positivity rates as those tested are more likely to have the disease. However over a two month period, strict lockdowns could flatten the curve as happened in the Northeast from March (although that really took at least a month to become evident). Overall, it is likely some of the states now on a trajectory towards >10% will be able to flatten the curve, but others may actually pick up speed that are not there yet. The partisan nature of acceptance of public health measures will be a significant factor in which states take which route."
