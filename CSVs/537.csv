99950,2021-03-24T21:22:33Z,1,[75.0],[75.0],"Putin's regime is personally interested in extension of Navalny's imprisonment indefinitely. His recent activities have created a lot of pain (including additional international sanctions and political unrest). The current imprisonment term ends right before the next presidential campaign starts in early 2024. So Kremlin has every incentive to extend it using any of the open investigations, including the one related to the non-profit fraud charges. On the matters related to Navalny and political opposition in general, Investigative Committee and courts in Russia are always consistent with the party line; the legal side of the matters is irrelevant. This was the case ever since the Yukos case and Khodorkovsky imprisonment in 2003. So overall probability of additional convictions is close to a 100%. What reduces probability is the August-15 deadline: there is no specific reason to have him convicted this summer; next year is fine too. Kremlin will carefully monitor the internal protest activity and pragmatically course correct. If Navalny's team is able to pull-off a national-level rally in the next few months (they aspire for a half million people) it may delay additional convictions."

He was previously convicted of fraud (2014) and it seems there have been several attempts on his life and numerous attempts to discredit him (justified or otherwise). Convicting the founder of the anti-corruption foundation of fraud would appear to undermine his credibility with moderate voters, but would cement his supporters in their convictions. That said its possible that he could die/ be killed in prison, it could take time for charges to be officially laid, and the trial could be drawn out (although this seems unlikely). Even another attempt on his life could delay trial. If charged, accquital by bench or jury is very unlikely (between 1 and 15%) so it comes down to if charges are laid in time. Politically, the next presidential election isn't for 4 years, although Duma elections are slated for September, which could make Navalny's conviction an election stunt. Given the current 5 month time frame it seems there is plenty of time to convict if it serves the political will, but given his current 2.5 years of imprisonment its not a rush and could serve future purpose. At this time it seems more likely it will be later as there are no major pressures to upset the status quo but, that could change if events dictate"

Previous cases seem to have been geared towards discrediting him and having the conviction bar him from running for public offices, both of which the Kremlin would still have an interest in. If a ruling is brought, it's unlikely that it would be to acquit an enemy of the state for crimes similar to ones he's already been convicted of, especially when acquittal is absurdly rare in trials in general.

Someone made a point that the charges were made when he was still WANTED in Germany. Now he is in jail.

The blueprint was established by the experience of Mikhail Khodorkovsky where is was further charged of committing fraud during his initial prison sentence. Mr. Khodorkovsky was not particularly popular in the country but was one the wealthiest individual in Russia at the time. His mis-judgment was that he involved himself in politics, against the government, that he had been warned against. The second fraud case extended his imprisonment in a distant penal colony. Alexei Navalny has been despatched to a penal colony from the maximum-security prison in the Moscow area. The government may have been dismayed by the size of the demonstrations where Navalny was used as a figure head for protests in general against the administration. Navalny has become a high-profile personality and perhaps a further fraud case brought at this time would perhaps result in further demonstrations and comment in the foreign press. Using Khodorkovsky as an example, a further fraud case would make sense when the publicity dies down and the demonstrations exhaust themselves in the next two or two and half years prior to his release on the initial prison sentence. Amnesty International have probably diminished Navalny’s case by downgrading his status form one of ‘prisoner of conscience’ due to his anti-migrant racist comments made some ten years ago."
