The only real constraint upon Putin is Russian sentiment https://www.levada.ru/en/ If you watch Russian media there is wall to wall coverage of the genocide in Dombass. The Russian people will not be fooled and if fooled cannot be fooled for long. Putin has lived in a bubble for 2 years. He maybe so impaired and disconnected from reality by yes men that he will actually invade beyond cease fire lines. For sure he has occupied Belarus merging that country effectively with Russia and has blockaded Ukraine and now almost certainly will recognize Luhansk and Donestk. All without sanctions. Every signal indicates he will invade ..so why not now? I puzzle on delay His forces are mobilized the pretextual justications are in place and he is selling Russian people hard. Meanwhile the rouble and stock market tank. On balance unless he can make his narrative compelling to the Russian people and so far he has not, he will not invade. Putin maybe the head of a criminal syndicate of Oligarchs but on matters of war and peace he is constrained by public opinion He may find that attempting to reconstruct the vestiges of Russian imperial rule causes him to lose his own empire. My bet is that he will not risk his present kingdom. In the end he is the greatest threat to Russian peace and security as well as his own regime. War is an uncertain arbiter of disputes and for Putin to risk his regime on a massive invasion of Ukraine is risky and irrational. One has to wonder if Putin has become so deluded by his own propaganda megalomania and insular bubble that he will invade. The signals are that he will but the absence of a groundswell of public opinion is conspicuous by silence."

But Zelensky warned the US and NATO that his intelligence officers disagree with their assessment and that there is no imminent danger. Zelensky went as far as blaming the US for affecting its economy with the panic of an imminent attack that they have created. Zelensky also said he was confident that the Russian threat is not as severe as some are making it out to be. “If you only look at the satellites, you will see the increase of troops. You can’t assess whether this is a threat, an attack or a simple rotation.” Another point of contention is Zelensky asking the US to impose sanctions on Russia and Putin now while Biden says sanctions will be imposed if Russia invades."

Despite the reticence of NATO members to allow Ukraine membership, on the basis of it's open-door policy and the possibility of expansion in other European countries like Sweden and Finland, it seems likely that the alliance will spread ever closer to Russian borders. Russia clearly views this as a threat and consequently is doubling down on its attempts to preserve and expand its own influence in the post-soviet sphere. The U.S. is also clearly not willing to make a credible commitment to actions that would prevent further annexation or occupation. In light of the strategic context, the interests of each party, and their willingness to commit to military action in the area, I think it is very likely that Russia moves to further their grip on Ukraine, invariably causing fatalities in the process.

There is also little support for a war among Russian citizens per polls afaik and Ukraine is not becoming more independent (or sovereign) as it struggles to establish the strong economy it would need to do so. Ukraine will not engage Russian troops except to defend itself from an active invasion that it perceives as final (c.f. Crimea where it did not contest the annexation much in military terms), but that is unlikely to happen if we don't believe Russia will actively move into Ukrainian territory and engage Ukrainian forces. The US has a role to play but is more focused on China, so they will be willing to accept trade-offs that avoid them being pulled into a more active conflict with Russia that would distract them from dealing with China. Neighbouring countries and the EU will also favour stability. Germany is reliant on Russia for energy, which is particularly important in the current energy crisis. France will want to look strong in the lead-up and right after elections, but benefits more from looking strong diplomatically as it wants to cement itself as the post-Merkel leader of the EU. Three deaths might not seem like much but that is the total number of deaths in the conflict that lead to Russia annexing Crimea (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation).

Attribution of Ukrainian military deaths to Russian forces is inherently difficult and vice versa. Because of this on Ukrainian side the Ukr Defense Ministry relies on memorial book.uk.org to tally the grim score. According to that source multiple military deaths on Ukr have not occurred in at least 5 years. If someone can find a Russian military death attributed to Ukr forces in the last 5 years please report. That would put the base rate at under 20 percent It's an extremely tense time but I respectfully believe that multiple fatalities are extremely unlikely to occur.

(That said I think a 17% chance is still quite high). The current force build up seems aimed squarely at compelling Ukraine/NATO to make a big concession as Putin looks more impatient with the status quo and wants a political settlement firmly in his favour. He clearly sees bringing Kiev into Moscow orbit as high priority for his legacy and is not going to let go of this. Despite what was described in a Swedish paper as ‘hostile’ talks between Blinken and Lavrov yesterday direct talks between Putin and Biden look like coming soon. I think Putin is very interested to see the lay of the land from such talks before making any decision. It is possible the Russians will want to put some treaty in the table that the west can look at and make their own amendments to, and even more likely in my opinion that the consequences of overt military action will be laid out to Putin and that these will have a significant deterrent effect. Ukrainian intelligence recently suggested that they believe Russia is planning to invade around February time. With this in mind I am taking some artistic licence with the question and thinking of the likelihood of it being answered by March 1st. I think we will get a much clearer idea of whether to revise up or down after any talks between Biden and Putin and expect the likelihood to be revised down if the question is not answered ‘Yes’ by March 1st."

Recently, a group of Ukrainian combat veterans were warmly welcomed to Washington, DC. (https://usukraine.org/news/articles/stronger-together/NjA4MTM=/). U.S. support for Ukraine remains strong and serves as a deterrent to Russia. Thus, tensions continue to build like magma heating under the surface of a volcano. WHEN is event described in the question going to happen (or when will a series of events add up to 3 deaths)? Sadly, I think the threshold of three service member deaths total will be achieved before the conflict is finally resolved at some point in the unforeseeable/difficult to see future. So, the question is therefore isolated to timing. Will the threshold death count be reached before or after the question deadline? I have gotten zapped on timing before (timing of delivery of the articles of impeachment for Trump, and timing of the death of RBG). I was accurate in the substance, but slightly off on the timing (and got hammered on my accuracy score). So the answer has to be yes (i.e. the probability cannot be zero, but that seems obvious, right?). But, also something close to the current 11% also seems overconfident, given the 10 months before the question closes. Remember, ""There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen""--Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. Events can turn very quickly. I really hate close to 50% probabilities, as that is a coin flip and as a professional forecaster, means, ""I dunno."" Sometimes that is as good as you can get. You can't tell. There are 312 days until the question closes, this is close to the limits of accurate forecasting of geopolitical events. Thus, I think a wide range is justified early on, then will narrow with time, and thoughtful consideration of new information as it becomes available. If I were to go narrower at this point, 1) I don't see facts or informations to support a narrower range, and 2) that narrower range would be speculative, or a guess. Some forecasters get lucky on guesses and claim to be ""right,"", but that is not effective forecasting in the long run."

The Russians consider themselves and the Ukraine people to of one sharing the same ethnicity and history and culture. This is certainly in the certainly the case of eastern Ukraine (Donbass etc.) Whereas according to some research, Western Ukraine have more European roots. The Russians appear to have a permanent fear about foreign forces encroaching on their land and being invaded, probably fuelled by the historic acts of Napoleon and Hitler. Given the land mass and the Russian winter this fear almost certainly misplaced. Ukraine joining NATO is a red line to Russia, that will not be crossed, but even if this was to be attempted (seriously annoying the Kremlin) it would splitting the western and eastern parts of the country. The Russian build of forces on the borders may be considered a warning (not to join NATO) rather than a potential invasion. The question does not allow for the use of eastern Ukraine proxy forces used by Russia to engage in conflict which will, perhaps result in fatalities. Therefore, a direct engagement between the national forces of the two countries is perhaps low in probability. I am confused as to the addition of Russian Law enforcement (Police?) in the question."
