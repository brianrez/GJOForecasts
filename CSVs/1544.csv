Even though they were attacked in 1975 by the Western Sahara over the dispute over who controls this portion of the Sahara, which was given to Morocco, the situation has been controlled through refugee camps and walls. The Moroccan stance on the Western Sahara has caused some trade problems with other nations. So Maroc has decided to allow AU non-recognition of Western Sahara independence to grow and solve the problem from an international point of view. This is the chosen path forward, not negotiations. Negotiations would recognize Western Sahara as having some right and sovereignty. https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2017/11/235173/sadr-morocco-nasser-bourita-eu-au-summit-polisario/"

Presently the price and demand for phosphorus is very low. Morocco will continue to control West Sahara with the purpose of controlling the supply and price of phosphorus. Another factor that could force Morocco to if nothing more than giving an appearance to negotiate is the Chinese purchase of San Leon energy which holds oil rites to territory overlapping West Sahara and Morocco. Any unilateral exploitation of this territory violate international law. It will have to be resolved. China has demonstrated very robust support both economically and politically for the African Union with the hope of economic development of natural resources and infrastructure in Africa. Its ultimate goal is stability. Any development or exploitation of natural resources in West Saharan territory will have to be resolved beteeen the Sahrawi and Morocco, to this date the AU, Un and the EU are on the side of the Sahrawi. Additionally SADR has recently taking actions against third parties who ship and purchase West Sahara natural resources from Moroccan and international companies that violate international law regarding natural resources in Conflict zones."
