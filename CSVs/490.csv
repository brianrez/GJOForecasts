While the figure is high and there is some legitimate concern of resources tightening some of this can be explained by other factors. shortages in semiconductors which led to car prices soaring are temporary and supply will soon resume. The government is already modifying entitlements to remove any negative incentives to not look for work which should help the pool of labour increase. I think the governments infrastructure plans are now dead in it's current form although this would have minimal concern in the short term it may give confidence to the central bank that inflation will not run out of control. I also think that the central government would prefer to reduce their bond buying before touching interest rates. however the central bank has now run out of room to over run as CPI is now at the rate predicted before the pandemic.
