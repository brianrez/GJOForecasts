If he can do this effectively it will show voters in his state that he has EMPATHY for people. At the same time he should ridicule the AG for not going after drug dealers but instead looking out for out-of-state special interests and his own career.

During the 2012 race, he campaigned as a strict conservative, enjoying support from the tea party movement and other far-right groups. McCrory, however, disputed criticism that he had shifted his views. An analysis of Republican governors by Nate Silver of the New York Times in April 2013 ranked McCrory as the ninth most conservative governor in the country. https://ballotpedia.org/Pat_McCrory https://www.patmccrory.com/2016/06/02/attorney-general-reverses-course-federal-litigation/ On the Friday before Memorial Day weekend, Attorney General Roy Cooper told a federal court that his office intends to appear on behalf of the State of North Carolina in the lawsuit involving the U.S. Department of Justice. This quiet reversal of the Attorney General’s public position comes after his office repeatedly indicated he would not defend the state in any lawsuit involving a common-sense law to protect privacy in bathrooms, locker rooms and shower facilities. His filings also indicate that his office engaged in conversations with the U.S. Department of Justice prior to entering the case. The Attorney General reversed his position without consulting any of the defendants in the lawsuit, and he did not make any public announcement that he had entered the case to represent the State of North Carolina. Both the Attorney General and his campaign made public statements as recently as yesterday that undermine the state’s position and contradict the legal filings by his office. Therefore, in light of the conflicting statements by the Attorney General, Governor McCrory filed notice in federal court that his administration intends to represent and defend the State of North Carolina in its lawsuit. (It seems that the Gov. doubt the tenacity with which the AG will defend the states position, so there is a fight over who has standing, with the Gov.Office insisting that THEY will represent the state in this matter.)"
