Since then, there is a downward trend of cases with 7.3K reported in Mar, 2021. If the second spike is followed by a similar downward trend, then cases will decrease over a roughly 3 month period, which would result in an increase in cases in April. The rate of falling case counts from January's spike to March 3rd ranged from 226 to 707 per day. This makes for an average falling case rate of 469.75. However, the downward trend is curved not linear with the cases reducing by 50% approximately every 30 days over a 3 x month period of decline. On Mar 2, 7.3K cases were reported, hence by April 1, approximately 3.65k cases will be reported. The number of cases reported will fall by roughly 121 per day. With the current case count at 2,854,741, the total number of cases added between 03MAR2021 and 01APR2021 is estimated to be 159,022.

The next category of a threshold is over 5 million reported cases. If we subtract the number of people who have died (105,001) and recovered (3,512,473) from COVID-19 in Africa, that leaves us with the current number of active COVID-19 cases: 319,554 (Africa CDC, 2021). With this number in mind, I then looked at the current infection rate of Africa. Given the first patient reported with COVID-19 in Africa was in Egypt on 14FEBUARY2021 (Al Jazeera, 2020), I divided the total number of reported cases by 12.5 adjusting for the months COVID-19 has been in Africa. This gave me 314,962.24/month. This number is very close to the current amount of 319,554. Given the next bracket being 5 million, COVID-19 would need to infect more than 1 million people within less than a month’s timespan. This infection rate would be more than triple the current pace COVID-19 has had in Africa. Due to this, I do not believe COVID-19 will surpass the 5 million case mark by 01APRIL2021 but will stay between 2.5 million and 5.0 million reported cases by Africa CDC. To track monthly trends, I have made an Excel spreadsheet of all the African countries and will be utilizing the John Hopkins University reports of African countries to spot large-scale increases or decreases in COVID-19, and then see if the African CDC seems to be reporting this."

There are 28 days between now (March 3rd) and April 1st. Assuming the daily average does not rise in the next month, which looks unlikely given the steady decline over the past month and a half, there will be around 294,000 new cases in the 28 days between now and April 1st. This means that based on these statistics, there will be around 4,208,000 cases reported by the Africa CDC as of April 1st.

Based on this information, Africa cannot have fewer than 2.5 million cases by 1 April 2021, therefore I have assigned a 0% probability for this outcome as it is impossible. Since the first case of coronavirus in Africa was declared on 14 February 2020, this indicates an infection rate of approximately 311,791.2 people per month (total cases divided by 12.5 months). Furthermore, with 317,628 active cases on the continent (total cases minus recoveries and deaths) each infected person would have to spread the virus to approximately 3.5 other people to infect an additional 1,102,610 within the next 31 days, thus breaking the “5 million” threshold to the next category. Africa appears to have had two peaks in daily infections; one around 23 July 2020 with 19,612 new cases and one around 9 January 2021 with 36,173 new cases, but the current seven-day average appears to be between 10,000 and 10,150. This rate does not show a significant difference from the average monthly infection rate, however, another spike similar to or greater than the one seen in January 2021 may provide a large enough deviation to surpass 5 million cases. Since the January 2021 spike was slow growing over several months and the rate of infection is currently on a decline, it is unlikely that it would occur with enough speed to reach this number within the next 31 days. Based on this information, I assess there is a 2% chance the number of cases could reach 5 million by 1 April 2021, and it is a certainty that it will not exceed 10 million cases within the same amount of time. It is almost certain (98%) the cases will remain between the current number and 5 million by 1 March 2021."

However, the growth rates have been slower than more developed countries due to fewer tests among other things. The testing rates could change with a large outbreak, but that doesn't seem very likely at this time IMHO.

Due to limited testing capacity Africa may never report as many cases as other countries (assuming it doesn't count antibody tests as confirmed cases, which I haven't been able to find information on whether it's doing that or not). But according to these articles South Africa is slowing down and antibody studies have indicated that as many as 10% of Africans may have already had the virus previously. That could be enough to slow the spread. The combination of low testing capacity and the possibility that many cases have already been missed by testing leads me to believe there's a possibility that the outbreak in Africa is either flat or trending down overall as opposed to trending up, or at least approaching the peak faster than I previously expected."

North Africa 5-6% The problem being that Sub-Saharan Africa spends more on debt repayment. Testing for the infection is sporadic across the continent, reporting is unreliable and 80% may be asymptomatic or mild. World Health Organisation recommend that 10-30 tests per confirmed case is an indication of adequate testing. Countries vary between 1% (Australia) and 50% (Mexico, Bolivia) of confirmed testing within communities so inadequate or not testing is problematic. The question does state ‘How many will be reported?’ rather than actual. The herd effect has come into play into those countries that have limited social distancing (Sweden), although lack of clean water etc may play a part.

Hattip @Eliac for reminding me that reporting across the continent is very uneven which may lead to large undercounts. At the current rate driven by S. Africa the continent will pass 1M mark by mid-August. The question hinges on how consistent countries are in reporting infections over time and across borders. I will therefore follow @Eliac example and detune my forecast for counting methods employed today. Using the original estimate of 1% of total population for 5 months and 2% for the second 5 and some additonal for final months."

Other countries are likely experiencing higher rates of spread but testing capacity and access to medical care is low. Africa skews way younger so many people are likely recovering without getting tested. Many countries are not able to do shut downs because people will starve so testing is less relevant for actually making policy so there may not be as hard of a push for more testing capabilities, especially when the US is still struggling to really make tests widely available.

The virus has not behaved consistently from country to country or even regions within a country. 2. So there is very little to extrapolate from as of June 2020. One has to base any early assumptions (july 2020) on understanding conditions that might affect the spread in Africa and its different regions. 3. While spread in Africans in general may not be enhanced by the factors seen in the west, like: preexisting conditions such as obesity, hyper tension etc. Instead in Africa it will be effected dispropotionatly by malnutrition, urban slums, lack of basic hygiene in large parts of the population, extreme density and lack of ability to quarantine in many of the cities, and the lack of adequate ICU units in even major city will be contributing factors across most of the continent. 4. Africa has managed to keep it numbers down by an early shut down that most African countries adopted and the stop in tourism also helped to keep the virus count down.. 5. African countries can not simply remain lockdown for much longer and starve its population. Plus it lacks the resources for the govt to feed them with a locked down economy, for more than a few months. 6. Fall and Winter is the peak tourism period, as some countries open up for tourism esp from china and EU where the numbers are low right now, the numbers in Africa will pick up fast. 7. Therefore once the lockdowns in these countries are lifted, which they have to be lifted in a couple of months to literally survive, the factors that make Africa vulnerable will be exposed. 8. With a population of 1.2 Billion even a 2% would be around 22 million. The US with all its resources is expected to exceed 1% by Fall.. 9. The final factor to consider is. In the absence of the ability to conduct large scale testing of even the dead. What assumptions will the African CDC use to calculate the number of cases across such a vastly varied continent, where basic testing is a luxury ? 10. Based on how off they have been with their early assumptions with countries like India and Brazil which showed no early signs of contagion but have since exponentially gone up, CDC will take those two factors into account an err on the side of a grossly conservative high estimate. 11. They will err on the side of a high estimate, also to keep the African countries from opening up too early unless there is a treatment or vaccine by then, which is a extremely low probability based on the history of vaccines. 12. What that tells me is that the total number of cases being higher than 2% of the population is extremely likely. And even if the CDC goes with a more conservative estimate it will not be fewer than 20 M."

As @MartinB points out the US with widespread infections over many climates is about 0.77% after 6 months and might be 1% after 9 months. At .5% of population would be 6M cases.

I'd point out that with the number of confirmed cases in the States approach 0.77% of the population in just six months of the virus's arrival, the outlook for Africa, where public health funding is minimal, is not good. There are many confounding factors that could slow the virus's spread, but it doesn't seem unreasonable to say that at least 1% of the population will have caught it in 9 months time. How many of those infectees will be reported to Africa CDC is another matter. Or rather, how many nations have the health infrastructure to match, say, US levels of population testing? The next few month will give a clearer idea of that."
