We should look at the historical data to set initial probabilities, but there are a lot of idiosyncrasies about North Korea that are not present with other nuclear states, and their situation is quite unique, so I do not think using ""typical nuclear state"" data makes sense. We first analyze the probability of detonating a nuclear device. North Korea has detonated 6 devices in the past 15 years that they have had the ability to test a nuclear weapon, leading to a base rate of 6/15 = 0.4. However this has occurred more in recent years as they have gotten more aggressive and admittedly capable in their nuclear powers, in particular in the Obama administration vs the Trump administration. So I think using the base rate of 5 tests in the 8 years of the Obama administration is more accurate, as corroborated in my previous response. This gives a rate of about 60% for detonating a nuclear device every year. There is only half a year until Jan 1 2022, so a chance of 30% for a nuclear test before Jan 1 2022."

Daily NK, 06/30/21, 'North Korea moves to significantly reorganize command structure of the Strategic Force': https://www.dailynk.com/english/north-korea-moves-significantly-reorganize-command-structure-strategic-force/ Clips from article: 'Both the East Sea and West Sea commands are focused on offensive capabilities. However, North Korean authorities plan to slightly reduce the West Sea command’s offensive capabilities relative to the East Sea command, while improving its defensive capabilities. North Korean media reported at the time that the meeting had presented “important tasks to bring about a new turning point in general national defense efforts.” Stressing the need to bolster the defensive capabilities of the Strategic Force, Kim reportedly pointed to the competition between the US and China and the scrapping of US guidelines on South Korean missile development during the recent US-South Korean summit. Kim also apparently said US pressure on North Korea was not simply aimed at denuclearizing the country, but is part of Washington’s international geopolitical strategy toward China. Kim reportedly issued an order that if the United States were to attack China, the West Sea command of the Strategic Force should defend against this and even launch retaliatory strikes. In sum, North Korean authorities believe the US is strengthening its containment of China using the North Korean nuclear issue as an excuse, and that hidden behind the scrapping of the US-South Korean missile guidelines is Washington’s intention to elevate pressure on Beijing.' The move by North Korea authorities to shift the focus of the nuclear issue within the context of Sino-American rivalries, and to stress bolstered military cooperation with China — and even the need for defensive strategies to help Beijing — appears to be aimed at winning Chinese economic cooperation and military support. In fact, Kim repeatedly mentioned the need for strengthening cooperation with China during the latest enlarged meeting of the Central Military Commission and plenary session of the Central Committee. There is also talk in North Korea that Kim could visit China in the latter half of the year. Following the decision to reorganize the Strategic Force, some of the missile systems currently operated by the country’s army, navy, and air force may be transferred to the Strategic Force.'"

This is an approach Biden is sharply rejecting as indicated by this article, with Biden refusing to grant North Korea international recognition. In contrast, while Obama did not take an explicitly aggressive approach, he still refused to grant North Korea legitimacy and held America's position, similarly to Biden: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/world/asia/trump-north-korea-threat.html. With this in mind it is reasonable to assume that relations would pick up through 2021, the first year of the Biden administration, similarly to in 2017; this also seems logical considering Biden and Obama are of closer political background than towards Trump. At the twilight years of the Obama administration in 2016 and 2017, North Korea conducted many nuclear tests and a few ICBM launches, documented at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests_of_North_Korea, https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/world/asia/north-korea-ballistic-missiles.html, and https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54500550. So it is reasonable to assume that North Korea will take an aggressive nuclear stance, which is further corroborated by https://www.npr.org/2021/05/02/992874499/north-korea-warns-u-s-over-bidens-big-blunder. However such nuclear tests only occur a few times a year at most in 2016-2017 and ICBM launches are similarly rare, as noted by the previous sources. Such an action would be unwise for North Korea from many perspectives, such as economic, political, etc., as indicated by Biden's aggressive stance. We can see that in 2017 and before North Korea conducted several nuclear tests, and that the ICBM launches then occurred, from the previous sources; it is unlikely that the ICBM launch would occur without the nuclear test according to the historical trend. This logic leads to my answer noted above; the largest single chance is that neither event will occur (say 50% probability), then the next most likely event is that both will if a pattern similar to 2017 plays out (say 30% probability), and then the only remaining larger chance outcome is that North Korea only conducts a nuclear test (say 15% probability)."

At the same time, the North Korean government believes that its missile and nuclear programs are key components of its foreign diplomacy. This means that even if investing in missile/nuclear programs will divert much-needed resources away from civilians, the North Korean government will very likely pursue weapons development to further disrupt US-China relations and potentially initiate sanction-relief talks with the United States. A quick sweep of reported North Korean tests also reveal an interesting pattern - a ramp up of activity in July/August (2017, 2019) and also alternating years between increased and decreased testing. Following these patterns, if North Korea was to detonate a nuclear weapon or launch an ICBM, it would likely to be sometime between July and August. There is not guarantee that the alternating years of activity will continue (especially since these years of inactivity correspond to changes in policy and relations)."

The probability is lowered because the Biden administration & Secretary of State Blinken want to reduce tensions with North Korea (perhaps with pseudo-denuclearization: ‘weak arms control and nonproliferation diplomacy,’ https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-usa/analysis-biden-faces-calls-to-jumpstart-north-korea-talks-with-more-pragmatic-goals-idUSKCN2AW0EH). I think it is very unlikely that NK will detonate a nuclear device on another country, as that would result in conflict and international condemnation. P(NK nuclear & long range ICBM) = P(NK ICBM | nuclear detonation) * P(nuclear detonation) P(NK long range ICBM | nuclear detonation) = 20%. That is, given that NK will detonate a nuclear device, it will do so via long-range ICBM with a probability of 0.20. In the unlikely event that NK does not simply conduct a nuclear test and attacks another country, the two most likely targets are its neighboring Asian countries or the US. I believe it is more likely to attack its Asian neighbors (and thus, be short range) due to history, politics, and technological considerations. So, P(NK nuclear & long range ICBM) = .2 * .025 = .5% P(NK long range ICBM) = 10% because NK has long-range rockets (>10,000 km) but all such missiles are still “In Development” (https://missilethreat.csis.org/country/dprk/). This probability reflects the fact that NK may increase its development of nuclear weapons technology in light of the growing obsolescence of its military capabilities. NK may want to use such a launch as a scare tactic or as a test. On the other hand, launches are extremely expensive and could draw economic sanctions. P(none) = 1 – P(NK ICBM) – P(nuclear detonation) + P(both) = 1 - .025 - .10 + .005 = 87%"

Given talks with Biden have not been going well, they might launch one in order to showcase their military power, but the likelihood still seems low to me given their tendency to turtle, and the lack of a need to show off to other countries to acknowledge their nuclear power since they already have."

Since the KN-23 appears to operate below the effective altitude of THAAD, the best countermeasure is to integrate THAAD with other weapons systems, especially PAC-3 and perhaps the Aegis system of the Batch 2 KDX-3-class destroyers scheduled to be completed by 2028. Also, if the THAAD systems in Japan and Guam are upgraded in the same way as anticipated for the South Korean THAAD, then they could all be linked automatically via the Alaska central command center known as regional missile defense.'"

The Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center, which encompasses various facilities central to North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, continued to construct a light-water reactor and to operate a uranium dioxide-production building and a five-megawatt electrical reactor, capable of producing seven kilograms of plutonium annually. The report documented that the uranium-enrichment facility in Yongbyon “was operating,” according to an unidentified state member of the Security Council. The report said North Korea appeared to be maintaining access to the Punggye-ri test site, where it had demolished the testing tunnels in 2018. The surrounding roads and bridges, recently damaged by typhoons, have been reconstructed. The report found that, at the Pyongsan uranium mine complex, new infrastructure has been constructed, and buildings have been modernized. The panel received information from an unidentified state member of the Security Council alleging cooperation between North Korea and Iran on long-range missile projects. Korea Mining and Development Trading Corp., North Korea’s primary arms dealer, and Shahid Hemat Industrial Group, the organization responsible for Iran’s liquid-fueled ballistic missile program, were involved in the transfer of critical parts such as valves, electronics, and measuring equipment and the sharing of missile specialists, the report said.'"

In June of last year, an institute in Sinpo was upgraded in status from “ship research institute” to a ”ship research branch” under the Academy of Defense Science, which develops nuclear submarines (article in Korean here). The source claims that “the matter, which had not been discussed at the first plenary session of the Eighth Party Congress in January, nor at the second plenary meeting of the Eighth Central Committee of the Workers’ Party in February, was suddenly decided in mid-March in response to the US continuing to explore and review its policy toward North Korea.” This may be a sign that the North Korean authorities have, until recently, expected the new US administration to create a global political atmosphere favorable to negotiations with North Korea, or allow for greater leeway in the midst of hostile policies. However, the Biden administration has instead made moves to tighten sanctions on North Korea, and started applying pressure from the get-go by narrowing in on issues such as that of human rights, which is a sensitive subject for the country. As a result, the North Korean authorities have responded by strengthening their policy focus on the development and deployment of strategic weapons, according to the source. The decision to promote the status of the Oct. 3 Factory to a special joint enterprise can be interpreted as a sign that North Korea will accelerate its production and deployment of nuclear weapons. As a result, it is possible that the North Korean authorities will continue with efforts to reorganize and expand the authority of military factories concerned with the development and production of strategic weapons.'"

It unveiled a new missile in October 2020 that has not been tested, and in January 2021 it unveiled an SLB that has also not be tested. We assume the new missiles have a range equal or greater than the Hwasong 14. As Kogo noted, tests tend to cluster, so it seems plausible that the current cluster will be capped off by the launch of one of the new missiles. His assessment of 30% seems reasonable. Regarding nuclear tests, the rate of 0.6 per year is correct, but in spite of breakdown in negotiations, there is not evidence I could find that North Korea has developed a larger yield nuclear device. NK seems to be focusing more on delivery mechanisms than on larger yields, as the former is more a game-changer in terms of US perception of risk. If NK conducts a test, I predict it will be a test of the miniaturized nuclear warhead that military intelligence believes they possess. However, all tests to date have escalated in size. A test of a smaller device would be technologically useful but symbolically less attractive, unless paired with test of a delivery mechanism. So I judge the likelihood of a nuclear device alone to be lower than the likelihood of both."

Despite public references to the moratoria from outgoing senior Administration officials, the Biden Administration is inheriting a North Korea that is moving toward resuming flight-tests of intermediate- and intercontinental-range missiles.'"

Biden has called the North Korean leader ‘a thug’ which is the Presidents usual epithet when describing those he does not like. Kim may therefore be predisposed to remind Biden that North Korea should be treated with equal status as a nuclear power. Another factor in the actions of North Korea is the actual or potential co-operation with Iran where both nations knowledge in nuclear weapons and missile technology complement each other. Iran does appear to flex its military muscles by proxy and as the US is deemed to be the common enemy, North Korea could be useful. The common opinion in the informed(?) press is that a North Korean test is due. Melissa Hanham, a non-proliferation expert and an affiliate with the Stanford Centre for International Security and Co-operation is certain of a test in the near future. Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Non-proliferation Programme at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California expects more missile tests in 2021. Pyongyang may see US-South Korean annual military exercises in March as an opportunity to test to justify its weapons tests but with a need to advance its technology."

Also, before engaging in such a daring act, he will watch and see how Biden performs. Thus, the launch of an ICBM will NOT happen in 2021."
