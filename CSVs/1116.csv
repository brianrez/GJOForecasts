I'm sure the US is not considering full on military intervention, and similarly Iran certainly does not want war, but continued small skirmish/sabre rattling likely, since both sides see increased tensions as possible pathway to get what they want--a satisfactory deal."

The US trying to invade Iran would be a disaster and the Generals know this. Otherwise it would have been done a decade or more ago. Fall out could easily hit Israel possibly dragging an unstable Lebanon into a civil war or even worse into the Syrian civil war. The US won't commit to these kind of scenarios which is why Iran is challenging them and it will probably be unanswered until another member of NATO and a core European country feel it's interests are threatened. The UK might have been such a country but seeing as how Brexit is forcing them out of the centre stage of European politics I doubt Germany and France would stir up the pot for them.

I don't think Trump is keen on war, not out of a sense of alturism but more that such a move would unpopular amongst his base (given the echoes of Iraq). Iran is far more useful as a bludgeon that Trump can use against the Obama legacy (a key priority) and actual war would be too much of a commitment. Something like the US stance against the Soviet union in the 1980s for example. I also think that Trump still believes that Iran will come to the table for talks (he likes the photos with leaders i.e. North Korea).

However, he is sufficiently mercurial that Iran will not wish to push him too hard again too soon. Having got their answer, they will stop asking the question for a while. One does not expect Iran to do anything much--and especially anything that might prove lethal--until October or so, and maybe not until January or so."

When I opened this question, the current crowd forecast was 69%. After I entered a forecast of 49%, the crowd forecast became 49%. How could the forecast of one person change the crowd's forecast so much? Then, for curiosity's sake, I changed my forecast to 35%, and voila, the current crowd forecast became--you guessed it--35%! Now I'm going to change my forecast to 48%, and I'll bet that the current crowd forecast will become 48%. @Emil"
