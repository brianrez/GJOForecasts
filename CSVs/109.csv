This district very slightly favors Republicans by a margin of +1 according to Cook's Partisan Voting Index. This election is a rematch. Davids won their first contest in 2020 by 10 points, but one win doesn't guarantee a second. In 2020, Republicans won 58% of the rematches in the US House. In 2018, Democrats won 52%. So, no real edge either way. At this point, I think Davids will hold onto this seat. Kansas surprised the rest of the country by overwhelmingly voting no to a ballot measure that would have amended the state constitution to upend abortion rights, and Davids doesn't seem to be struggling against attack ads the same way other Democrats are coming down the stretch. The expert consensus sounds about right. 55-45, Davids."
