September volume registers a modest $1 billion thus far, with filings from iQor US Inc. and Town Sports International Inc., though there could be another $3.5 billion coming. Travelport LLC’s sizable distressed debt exchange (DDE) along with J Jill Group’s restructuring and filings from Chief Power LLC and FTS International Inc. are names to watch. The default pace has certainly slowed from the $9.6 billion monthly average occurring over April through July, but activity is expected to remain elevated throughout the year and into 2021. In March, Fitch projected a two-year cumulative base case default of about 15% by YE 2021, with 5%–6% forecast for YE 2020. We expect the default rate to finish the year at the lower end of our base case range. The YTD default rate is 3.7% on $53.2 billion of volume. It would take another $19 billion to reach 5%. https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-us-leveraged-loan-default-insight-default-rate-to-rise-ninth-straight-month-top-loans-of-concern-total-increases-18-09-2020"

The FED lowered rates and made loans available quickly, the CARES act seemed to provide good assistance for businesses. I'd guess the climb in leverage loan default will be slower than we saw in 2008 and 2009 for this reason, and it's possible (if the government continues to play an effective role) that these default rates don't exceed 6%. I'd guess they probably will, but I think there's good reason to believe it won't shoot up as fast as in the last recession."

[1] But despite these scary numbers, there doesn't seem to be an obvious linear relationship in default rates. In fact, it seems to be the exact opposite in some cases.
