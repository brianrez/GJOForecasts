Greece has openly called for the EU--and specifically Germany--to impose an arms embargo on Turkey for its oil and natural gas exploration in its declared (but what Greece says is illegal) Economic Exclusion Zone. Germany is set to deliver 6 new subs to Turkey in the coming weeks, a deal for the offensive weapons dating back to 2009. Germany seems unlikely to bring the topic up during the next EU summit starting on Wednesday. That being said, a German naval frigate enforcing an EU arms embargo on Libya did recently board a Turkish commercial vessel for an inspection for possibly carrying illegal arms to the North African country. One of the wild cards in the coming day is France, which has recently been at odds with Turkey over the oil exploration, providing arms to Libya, and immigration policy. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-security-eu-france/eu-governments-limit-arms-sales-to-turkey-but-avoid-embargo-idUSKBN1WT0M4 https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/27/turkey-probes-german-navys-search-of-libya-bound-freighter https://www.politico.eu/article/greece-blasts-berlin-for-shunning-plea-for-turkey-arms-embargo/"

I also remembered recently the back-and-forth between the US, Russia and Turkey in 2019 over Turkish purchases of S-400s versus F-35s (https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/dubai-air-show/2019/11/12/turkeys-s-400-buy-may-have-spoiled-gulf-nations-chances-of-flying-the-f-35/). While these are part of an ongoing trend of Turkish boundary-pushing (and therefore not likely to trigger a dramatic EU response on their own), I assess that these two items moderately increase the chances of a dramatic arms embargo action. @Eric_Blair 's comment on Germany driving a stronger action is not highly convincing to me since Germany is driven by complex interrelationships and strong pro-stability incentives that an arms embargo would upset. Put another way, while this is an interesting option for Germany, there is tons of opportunity cost. That said, I adjust my forecast up because it's reasonable to think this angle could gain more traction than I expect in the German government, and Germany could indeed push the EU writ large if they chose to. Overall, the strong institutional and normative trends that I mention in my initial forecast are continue to be very likely to preclude an action as severe as an arms embargo."

The discovery over the last decade of major natural gas fields beneath the eastern Mediterranean has driven the region’s often-divided nations to work together to exploit the reserves. Cyprus, Israel and Egypt would enrich themselves while their exports through Greece and Italy would help Europe reduce its dependence on Russian gas. One catch: Turkey was left out of the picture, and with an active navy in the region, it’s sending signals it doesn’t intend to miss out (Honestly, I can't blame them!). 2. Turkey has used its warships to interfere with gas exploration and has asserted itself in a variety of instances. Turkish vessels in 2018 blocked (https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/turkish-warships-chase-off-eni-s-drillship) a ship contracted by the Italian oil company Eni SpA from approaching a work site within Cyprus’s exclusive economic zone. And Turkey has deployed newly procured drilling ships to search for gas in the area. 3. In January 2019, Cyprus, Israel and Egypt together with neighbors Greece, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority and Italy founded the East Mediterranean Gas Forum. 4. In January 2020, Greece, Israel and Cyprus signed an accord for the construction of a 1,900-kilometer (1,181-mile) undersea pipeline, called the EastMed, to connect gas fields in the eastern Mediterranean with European markets through Greece and Italy. 5. Turkey was left out because the Republic of Cyprus was included. Turkey doesn’t recognize Cyprus. Cyprus was in effect partitioned in 1963 when fighting erupted between Turkish Cypriots in the north and Greek Cypriots in the south. It was fully divided in 1974 after Turkey captured the northern third of the island following a coup by supporters of union with Greece. The breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north, known as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, is recognized only by Turkey, while the government in the south is recognized internationally. 6. Turkey argue that the shortest route for a gas pipeline from the region to Europe would be from Northern Cyprus through Turkey. 7. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in January that “EastMed is not a threat to anyone,” while the EU is considering imposing sanctions against Turkey for acting unilaterally near Cyprus and Greece. 8. Erdogan insisted Turkey was open to solving disputes through dialog, while Greece and Cyprus have made similar statements. 9. Greece called on the three countries -- and particularly Germany -- to halt exports of military equipment to Turkey including submarines and frigates, 10.

France is clearly leading the charge to build an consensus around sanctions on Turkey. but arms embargos are probably too extreme a step at this point. Historically, EU arms embargos either mirror UN sanctions, or are otherwise targeted against internationally isolated nations. Turkey is neither, with close economic ties with the EU, membership in NATO, dynamic and evolving relationships with Russia, and a more assertive and expansive foreign policy throughout the Mediterranean region. Tensions between Turkey and some EU nations are inevitable given an acrimonious (and unfruitful) EU accessions process that doesn't favor the Turks and breeds distrust. These are all contextual factors that, 1) given that EU arms embargos are not common against non-isolated nations, 2) EU arms sanctions require unanimity amongst the EU (which doesn't exist on most issues anyways) 3) there is not much time to gain this consensus before the end of the year, 4) there are steps available short of an arms embargo (censure, non-binding resolutions, interim economic or other such sanctions that make it unlikely to see arms sanctions before the end of this year"

It still does not directly says it could be an arms embargo. And it is made by a French EU official. Thus doubt subsists, but I believe it raises the prospect of actual European sanctions in December (from 90% to 95%). However, the fact that the arms embargo is not mentioned in this discussion makes me reduce the prospect of an arms embargo discussion significantly (from 80% to 20%). I feel it would not make sense to not threaten Turkey with this specific sanction namely, if it is actually the plan. Moreover this declaration comes from a French citizen, while France is likely with Greece the more willing nation to sanction Turkey.

I do not think that arms embargos happen frequently enough that a base rate can be established in general, but to construct a base rate would require specific contextual information that would be debatable at best. Thus, I think that contextual information about voting patterns in recent EU votes against Turkey is more relevant. That rhetoric around Turkey, Cyrpus, and Greece has been increasing dramatically with arms sanctions implemented on Turkey by many of its NATO allies last year for its support of anti-Kurdish operations in Syria. The Rhetoric around Cyprus and the Eastern Med has been mutually divisive with the EU condemning Turkish actions and successfully implementing economic and travel sanctions in 2019 (https://www.sanctionsmap.eu/#/main/details/49/?search=%7B%22value%22:%22%22,%22searchType%22:%7B%7D%7D,) Despite the interrelatedness of EU and Turkish economies, but these economic sanctions were limited to only individuals who were involved with drilling in Cypriot designated waters. While the Turkish President recently called for a two-state solution in Cyrpus (https://www.politico.eu/article/erdogan-calls-for-two-state-solution-for-cyprus/). Additionally, the US lifted its arms embargo on Cyprus in Sep 2020. Given that Cyprus is an EU member and Turkey is calling for its division, I believe some form of arms sanctions are likely in the near-term in response from the EU member states, but an EU arms embargo would require a unanimous decision by the European Union Member States in Council (https://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/cfsp/sanctions/docs/index_en.pdf , page 7). Germany remains a major benefactor of Turkish arms sales as @DNK89 pointed out. Thus, an arms embargo (taken to mean a complete prohibition on arms sales from the EU) seems unlikely given the targeted nature of previous sanctions and the requirement for unanimity. The likelihood of Cypriot, Greek, and/or French arms embargoes or targeted denial of specific arms to Turkey to send a message is much greater than a complete prohibition on arms sales."

I didn't click through every country to analyze the sanctions but the ones that I looked at with arms embargoes involved some aspect of trying to quell violence or human rights abuses. It doesn't seem like it would fit the pattern for EU to impose arms embargo on Turkey over only economic concerns. So unless they are going to tie in some other rationale I don't see it happening. Admittedly this is my last forecasting question of the night and I haven't really researched the details of why EU wants to impose sanctions, or what their policy is in al previous cases."
96727,2020-11-12T22:56:59Z,2,[1.0],[-4.0],Turkey's action thus far do not meet previous thresholds that EU uses to establish arms embargoes. This action will be taken very seriously because there is EU/international motivation to not push Turkey to Russia.

The EU is very capable of applying arms embargoes— it's actually the case for 7 countries (18 if we count the UN sanctions that are followed by the EU)— but the EU's official policy is to favor diplomatic dialogue, in general. There are also a large variety of other sanctions that can be used instead. Greece, which is the main concerned country is not 100% supporting an embargo, because, as Hungary and Malta, it fears the threat of an immigration flow that Turkey could release in retaliation. Germany, Spain, and Italy have economic interests that may affect their desire to apply an arms embargo. All those countries opposed their veto to a proposition of an arms embargo in 2019. However, the situation is much different in 2020 and has escalated. Since Turkey is rejecting dialogue and, on the contrary, increases its threats, the tension escalates on both sides. I believe only Hungary and Malta may be opposed to an embargo now. The stronger will of the other EU countries may force them to oblige, provided that concessions are made or actions are taken to deal with the migration problems. The recent waves of terrorism attacks (though not directly related to migration) have given more incentives to seriously address the migration issue (I heard some official declarations on the subject which pointed to an EU consensus). It will very likely be debated in December. Therefore, there's a possibility that Hungary and Malta agree on the arms embargo if their concerns regarding migration are tackled simultaneously through another set of decisions and actions. As far as other countries (external to the EU) are concerned, I see no potential pressure that could prevent the EU from taking sanctions. EU sanctions do not apply to non-EU countries, and, in particular, the US and the UK (who are both selling arms to Turkey) would not be affected. However, this simple fact may also discourage the EU to apply any sanctions that may then be ineffective (as Turkey claims they would), especially if Russia keeps trading arms with Turkey too. Moreover, it is true that Turkey has a growing military industry that is more and more able to sustain Turkey's needs (at least for short term needs). Therefore, I estimate a 90% chances that sanctions will be discussed in December. 80% chances the question of Arms embargo will be discussed in that case (thus 72% overall). 50% chances it will be put to a vote (=> 36%). 70% chances it will be a unanimous yes, if voted. Hence, I get a 25% overall (I have multiplied all those percentages)."
