Portugal seems to have a high vaccination rate which indicates public trust in the government's response to the pandemic. The election is soon after the last one so the political scene may not have changed enough for voters to have changed their view over the direction of the country under the current government. At the moment I am guessing that the result will be similar to the previous election for the PS."
