I strongly believe they do not want to surpass 200k deliveries mark in June to be eligible for another quarter of 7500 tax credit. Only issue is that insideev data is covering only US market so some of model 3 can go to Canada, only foreign market where Tesla delivers model3, and are not included in above numbers, hovewer tesla started to deliver model 3 to Canada only in mid of May and it is not huge market for ev cars yet therefore I do not believe it could be more than 1 or 2k . Based on all above I strongly bet on below 29k with thin probability for higher bucket. I know that majority of forecasters here are using Bloomberg Tesla production tracker trying to figure out lag between production and deliveries but in my opinion insideev data will work better here as 1. It tracks deliveries not production. 2. There is no track record that Bloomberg model is really working and estimates production accurately."

I'm not sure if deliveries equal cars made, so if I subtract a week, you get less than 50,000K. Given problems and prior misses I'm also skeptical of goal. However, production could ramp up more than 2,600 in last three weeks, if this goes to 3k for rest of of may and ramps up to 4k in June, still above 50K, so I still assgn meaningful odds to over 50k."
