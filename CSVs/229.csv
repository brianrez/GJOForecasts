From now to May 25 of 2022, the chance of President Zelensky ceasing his presidency seems to be slim for numerous reasons. One of them is that the war, and or battle, is far from over. The war has been going on since February of this year and now it is May, which means that neither side has won or surrendered. Additionally, Ukraine seems to be holding up pretty well, receiving militarism and economical assistance to fight through the war. The only times I would see Zelensky possible stepping down would be if he was captured or if anyone close to him, including high-ranking officials and or family, were to be captured in return for him stepping down. Another reason we would see him step down would be if he were to be killed, however, since everyone around him is more than likely heavily armed, this also seems to not be likely to occur."

106325,2022-05-19T18:47:32Z,1,[3.0],[3.0],President Zelensky will not flee Ukraine or cease to be its president before May 25. Russia and Ukraine have been at war for the past 2 months and Zelensky has done a great job leading his country in the fight against a powerful military. With all things considered Zelensky will still be president on May 25th because he is currently in a safe place and walks around with security to eliminate any possible threats. As seen on TV through news broadcast he appears to still be strong and has gained a lot of faith in his country. He has not shown any signs of stepping down or giving up his power. He is continuing to stay strong for the citizens of Ukraine and demonstrate that by not fleeing the country and leaving people to fight for themselves.

Russian ground forces have stalled, at least for the moment, and are apparently pivoting to outflank Ukrainian ground forces rather than to make some strike towards Zelensky's location.

There are plenty of thugs willing to do that, but we also saw that they are not as effective as Putin may like. Moreover, intense discussions in the White House and in closed-door meetings on Capitol Hill have focused on how to provide aid to Ukraine should Russia take over the capital. In that situation, the administration currently plans to continue overtly supplying weaponry to the Ukrainians. However, Under the Ukrainian Constitution, the speaker, or chairperson, of Parliament would succeed Mr. Zelensky as acting president. AND, The United States, Britain, and the European Union would not recognize a government set up by Russia. All efforts to assassinate Zelensky may not be worth the effort after all. He would be an instant hero and more outcry from the world. (One charismatic leader that Putin cannot kill, poison, or imprison)"

That said, I suspect even with overwhelming forces the Russian army is not up to the task at hand and is unlikely to be able to complete this before an extended conflict. Their equipment is poorly maintained and subject to elevated operational attrition contributing to poor logistics. The Russian army currently has not deployed their full forces and is unlikely to do so since the remaining forces are not properly trained for this action. The Ukrainian forces are highly motivated and have the advantage of defensive positions and spring conditions (muddy fields): hit and run on logistics, ambushing Russian columns constrained to roads, smart munitions and home advantage of food and water. So this will be a protracted affair from what we see now. I do not see the Russians gaining an advantage over the Ukrainian forces in the next 12 weeks with current levels of NATO support and forcing Zelensky to flee. Zelensky is key to Ukrainians morale and absent a bomb or assassination (already attempted several times) he will stay. As to 25 May 2022 I think the chances are high he will survive and low that he will die/leave."

Neither of these two options fits in his head: he is neither going to be fired nor is he going to flee. There is only the (remote) option that he will die in a possible terrorist attack.

So far, at least publicly, he was signalled willingness to stay until a (potentially) bitter end.

Odds are still favouring Russian troops, even though setbacks are massive compared to their objective. Not the slightest indication of withdrawal concurrent with the supposed China-mediated talks. - Point of contrast would be the possibility of self-sufficient defense by Ukrainian troops, which seems unlikely to fence off the Russian sieging of Ukraine.

Unlike Kyiv, Bagdad was in the middle of Iraq and the coalition needed to deal with Basra being on the way and the possibility of the supply line disruption coming from that city. WW2 cases take a month or two before the capital falls. Both have supply risks for the invader. Kyiv seems to have the least supply line risk. So the delay would only be due to resistance at the city. Battle for Baghdad lasted 7 days. Panama fighting lasted about 4 days. Similar in Grenada. Given Iraqi defense for Baghdad was grossly mismanaged Kyiv may fight longer. The capabilities of attackers and defenders are different. But this is urban warfare -some fundamentals must be similar. Kyiv falls by the (1st to 8th of March). However, Ukraine has a large population (41M) landmass (over 600,000km^2)..... Ukraine's government will successfully re-locate 90% probability with Zelensky. why would Zelensky leave Ukraine? No more support from the population/Russians are everywhere in Ukraine/ -> not probable Do Russians want Zelensky captured or killed? Zelensky seems to be popular.

Until that is lifted, I don't see how he can leave in good faith. The crux for me is ""cease to be president"" portion. The question is by whose definition? If Russia takes Kyiv (as it is likely to do) and installs a person to run the country and names him president, does that make him the president of Ukraine?
