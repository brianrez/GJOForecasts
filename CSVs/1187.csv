If BA were to suddenly drop by 30% it would put the Dow in the same ballpark as the Russell, with regard to their gains since January 31.

So this also points to R2000, like the point above. Nevertheless I am giving Nasdaq the second highest probability, because Nasdaq and R2000 are currently the two indices performing worst when looking at a 6 month sliding window. - The ratio of current value/value at end of 31 Jan 2019 sees R2000 being the best performing though (at a ratio of 1.06), with the others very close together (DJIA 1.041, Nasdaq 1.043, S&P 1.037)"
