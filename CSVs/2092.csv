I am trying not to be too swayed by the Economists viewpoint per see as the Economist doesn't get a vote in the elections, though some of its readers could apply pressure.

It has been painful to watch. MHP should have been the junior partner, and instead they played spoiled rich kid. CHP seemed like they genuinely tried, a little, but they didn't really try. HDP had no shot. Then PKK and IS both decide now is a good time to all but declare war inside Turkey, and E keeps acting like he's got this in the bag, while D does his best lap-dog impersonation. The only way this seems to have any shot at happening is if AKP takes seats from MHP, because I can't imagine HDP losing seats, now that Turkey is bombing Kurds in Iraq, too. MHP certainly has been acting like it doesn't want to exist, any more, but can you imagine them intentionally giving E the keys to changing the constitution so he can have more executive power?"
