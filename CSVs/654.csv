Facebook/Meta, who has been put under quite some pressure to split its sub-companies resisted to do so. That I know there is no law coming to force this step, so Amazon too would be safe in that respect despite the recent fines they received for violating antitrust laws (e.g. in Italy). As this prediction is being made on Dec 12th and the year is almost over, the likelihood for it to happen within 18 days is probably low. 5% should serve as a higher boundary of likelihood to account for the fact that the chance of an event is almost never 0."

This corporate thinking is often mistaken: Avaya did well, much better than Lucent, after the spinoff, once it was freed from the dead hand of the parent's management. AWS, on the other hand, is doing very well, arguably better than Amazon as a whole, and the Amazon CEO was most recently head of AWS for a very long time and is very familiar with its strengths and weaknesses. Amazon is committed to the long term growth of stockholder value, and having a strong cash producer, such as AWS, helps grow the overall business, much as the insurance businesses have help grow Bershire Hathaway.

For these reasons I think even if AWS were more valuable as a separate company, to Amazon that potential boost in valuation of the two companies is outweighed by the ability to use the profits from AWS elsewhere in Amazon. As I don’t believe markers would pressure Amazon to sell AWS, an announcement of a regulatory investigation into anti-competitive behavior by AWS could possibly trigger this. I see this as unlikely in the next month, and the timetable between announcement of the investigation and Amazon’s announcement of spinning off AWS would be longer than a few weeks.

He was head of AWS before, so he knows it inside and out, and may have personal attachment to keeping it under one company. This issue may have been discussed privately between him and the Amazon board of directors, so if the board wanted to spin off AWS, they may have chosen a different CEO, and maybe made Andy Jassy, who has a proven track record with AWS, to continue as the CEO of the spun-off AWS.

With Delta cases rising, and markets currently falling, this does not appear to be an ideal environment for that. The Outside View, chance of any spin-offs being announced, would seem to be very small. Every company is unique in this sense having different assets that mean different things, but the chance of any spin-off being announced would seem to be extremely small over any 4-month period. Factors for the spin-off are the AWS would be able to pickup additional business as being tied to Amazon has been holding them back somewhat. The spin off also may be forced from a regulatory perspective at some point."

Moreover, it also seems reasonable to assume that Amazon would invest important resources into fighting off any pressure on them to spin off AWS. An outcome where Amazon is forced to spin off AWS only seems realistic if the US government were to build a case for it, and succeed with their argument.

The cash that AWS generates is very useful for Amazon as it tries to maintain its position across the entire retail ecosystem, while expanding into infrastructure, entertainment and whatever else. And then there's the timing. I don't think you'll see a major offering like this toward the last three weeks of the year when markets are preparing for year-end. That leaves less than five months to start planning the spin-off, which I presume they'll want to do well rather than leave money on the table. Jan. 1 2022 is this question's deadline, but it's not Amazon's deadline. Given all that Congress has on its plate, and the relative newness of Biden's regulatory crew, it's going to be a long time before they can get their ducks in a row and exert any real pressure, if that's what they really want to do.

That being said, it does not seem that Andy Jassy is particularly keen on spinning off AWS just yet, but he does see it as a nontrivial possibility. There are a number of reasons for and against spinning off AWS. First, as AWS and Amazon continue to grow, the amount of regulation between the two will become a large issue. Splitting off AWS could save Amazon lots of time spent in restructuring down the line. On the other hand though, AWS does account for much of the income of Amazon. In 2020 Q4, AWS accounted for 52% of Amazon's operating income. It is essentially a cash cow for Amazon that allows Amazon to take risks such as the Kindle, Alexa, or the FireStick. On top of that Amazon relies mostly on consumer retail so it will be hit hard by a possible recession and not having something like AWS by its side could be very risky for Amazon. I do think that Amazon will eventually spin off AWS, but I do not imagine that this announcement will come anytime soon."

Moreover the CEO designate is the person who ran AWS and it being the important profit generator, the CEO's expertise will add more weight. The other strong reason could be political intervention which could dictate the spin off of AWS from Amazon.

As for Amazon voluntarily spinning AWS, erudite commentators seem intent on arguing why it should happen, but I've generally found this unreliable as to what the inner circle plans. Such a move would likely be held close to the chest. Has a spin off of this magnitude ever happened by the Big 5? Staying consolidated is generally in their strategic and competitive interest. They acquire all the time, but are not in the habit of divesting. It would be a major departure from this for Amazon to be the first to do so in a long time. The short time period is also a factor.

There are ~3500 public stocks in the US so an approximate base rate of 0.6%. Given uncertainty in data, I think it's far more likely this undercounts spinoffs than overcounts them, so I would estimate between 0.25% - 3% of public companies have a spinoff per year. We have slightly less than 8 months left in the year, but this question is about announcing vs completing, and it looks like this often takes ~2 months, so we'll go with 10/12 * (0.25 - 3%) and a base rate of .21% - 2.5% base rate range."
