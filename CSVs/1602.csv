Progress on pensions reform before end of October now looks unlikely following President Temer's second indictment but it seems this has already been factored into expectations (https://www.ft.com/content/78dfa0e6-98fd-11e7-a652-cde3f882dd7b) with markets optimistic that pensions reform would pick up pace again by the end of the year. 2018 election prospects also relevant to market sentiment but very early days as yet. On this basis, feels unlikely that the next 1.5 months will bring sharp movements of the kind seen in May or July this year, and would guess that investors are likely to keep leaning on the optimistic side."
